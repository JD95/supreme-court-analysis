DEATH OF CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER

Supreme Court of the United States

MONDAY, JUNE 26, 1995

Present: Chief Justice Rehnquist, Justice O'Connor,
Justice Scalia, Justice Kennedy, Justice Souter, Justice Thomas, Justice Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer.

The Chief Justice said:
As we open this morning, I announce with sadness that
our friend and colleague Warren Earl Burger, former Chief
Justice of this Court, died yesterday in the early morning, at
Sibley Hospital in Washington, D. C.

He was born in St. Paul, Minnesota, in 1907. He was a
self-made man. Not having the finances to attend college
full time he sold insurance during the day to pay his way
through night school. He spent two years at the University
of Minnesota and then graduated with honors four years
later from the Mitchell College of Law, formerly the St. Paul
College of Law.

His remarkable professional career began with a long tenure at a private firm in St. Paul where he specialized in civil
and administrative practice. While in private practice, he
made time to be an adjunct professor of contracts and actively participated in local civic and political organizations.
In 1953, President Eisenhower appointed him to the Department of Justice as an Assistant Attorney General in charge
of the Civil Division. A few years later, he was nominated
to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit, where he served for 13 years until his apv

vi DEATH OF CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER
pointment as Chief Justice of the United States by PresidentNixon in 1969.

He served as Chief Justice for 17 years and will long beremembered as a major contributor to the decisional law of
this Court. He was also an innovative reformer of the ad-ministration of justice. As appellate judge he had helped
establish the Appellate Judges' Seminar at New York Uni-versity and later cochaired an eight-year study for the ABA
on standards of criminal justice. As Chief Justice, he re-duced the time for oral arguments in our own Court from
two hours to one hour, he introduced modern technology tothe processing of opinions, he changed our straight bench
into a bench with its current wings, and he helped found theSupreme Court Historical Society. For the judicial system
as a whole, he helped create or sponsor, a series of institu-tions to foster more efficient ways to do justice in the nation's
courts. These included the Institute for Court Manage-ment, the National Center for State Courts, the state-federal
judicial councils, the expansion of the Federal Judicial Cen-ter, and the annual Brookings Seminars at which leaders of
the three branches met to discuss judicial reform.Following his retirement as Chief Justice in 1986, he continued his commitment to public service and devoted largeamounts of his time to the Chairing of the Commission on
the Bicentennial of the United States Constitution. And asa result of his efforts as chairman of that Commission, millions and millions of people who were previously unac-quainted with the United States Constitution became acquainted with it.The members of the Court will greatly miss Chief Justice
Burger's energy and warmth, and I speak for all of themin expressing our profound sympathy to his son Wade, his
daughter Margaret Mary, his grandchildren, and to all thosewhose lives were touched by this remarkable man and his
wife Vera, who died last year. The recess the Court takestoday will be in his memory. At an appropriate time, the
traditional memorial observance of the Court and Bar of theCourt will be held in this Courtroom.

CASES ADJUDGED

IN THE

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

AT
OCTOBER TERM, 1994

NEBRASKA v. WYOMING et al.
on exceptions to report of special master
No. 108, Orig. Argued March 21, 1995--Decided May 30, 1995
A 1945 decree rationing the North Platte River among users in Wyoming,

Nebraska, and Colorado enjoins Colorado and Wyoming from diverting
or storing water above prescribed amounts on the river's upper reaches;
sets priorities among Wyoming canals that divert water for the use of
Nebraska irrigators and federal reservoirs; apportions the natural
irrigation-season flows of the river's so-called "pivotal reach" between
Nebraska and Wyoming; and authorizes any party to apply to amend
the decree for further relief. Nebraska v. Wyoming, 325 U. S. 589. Nebraska sought such relief in 1986, alleging that Wyoming was threatening its equitable apportionment, primarily by planning water projects
on tributaries that have historically added significant flows to the pivotal reach. After this Court overruled the parties' objections to the
Special Master's First and Second Interim Reports, Nebraska v. Wyoming, 507 U. S. 584, Nebraska and Wyoming sought leave to amend their
pleadings. The Master's Third Interim Report recommended that Nebraska be allowed to substitute three counts of its Amended Petition
and that Wyoming be allowed to substitute three of its proposed counterclaims and four of its proposed cross-claims. Wyoming has filed four
exceptions to the Master's recommendations and Nebraska and the
United States a single (and largely overlapping) exception each.

Held: The exceptions are overruled. Pp. 8-23.

(a) The requirement of obtaining leave to file a complaint in an original action serves an important gatekeeping function, and proposed
pleading amendments must be scrutinized closely to see whether they

1

Syllabus
would take the litigation beyond what the Court reasonably anticipated
when granting leave to file the initial pleadings. As the decree indicates, the litigation here is not restricted solely to enforcement of rights
determined in the prior proceedings. However, while the parties may
ask for a reweighing of equities and an injunction declaring new rights
and responsibilities, they must make a showing of substantial injury to
be entitled to relief. The Master duly appreciated these conclusions
when considering the proposed amendments to the pleadings. Pp. 8-9.

(b) Wyoming takes exception to the Master's recommendation that it
be denied leave to file its First Amended Counterclaim and Cross-Claim,
which allege that Nebraska and the United States have failed to recognize beneficial use limitations on diversions of canals and that Nebraska
has violated the equitable apportionment by demanding natural flow and
storage water from sources above Tri-State Dam for use below the dam.
However, by seeking to replace a proportionate sharing of the pivotal
reach's natural flows with a scheme based on the beneficial use requirement of the pivotal reach irrigators, presumably to Wyoming's advantage, Wyoming in reality is calling for a fundamental modification of the
scheme established in 1945, without alleging any change in conditions
that would arguably justify so bold a step. Pp. 9-11.

(c) The Master's intention to consider a broad array of downstream
interests and to hear evidence of injury not only to downstream irrigators, but also to wildlife and wildlife habitat, when passing on Nebraska's request that the decree be modified to enjoin Wyoming's proposed
developments on the North Platte's tributaries does not, as Wyoming
argues in its exception, run counter to this Court's denial of two of
Nebraska's earlier motions to amend. Those earlier claims sought to
assign an affirmative obligation to protect wildlife, while, here, the
effect on wildlife is but one equity to be balanced in determining
whether the decree can be modified. Moreover, Nebraska is seeking
not broad new apportionments, but only to have discrete Wyoming
developments enjoined. If its environmental claims are speculative,
Nebraska will not be able to make the necessary showing of substantial injury. Pp. 11-13.

(d) Nebraska's allegations that Wyoming's actions along the Horse
Creek tributary threaten serious depletion of return flows, with injury
to Nebraska's interests, describe a change in conditions sufficient, if
proven, to warrant the injunctive relief sought. Thus, Wyoming's
exception to the Master's recommendation that Nebraska be allowed
to proceed with its challenge cannot succeed. Pp. 13-14.

(e) Nebraska's allegation that Wyoming's increased groundwater
pumping threatens substantial depletion of the river's natural flow also
describes a change in conditions posing a threat of significant injury.

Syllabus
In excepting to the Master's recommendation that the claim go forward,
Wyoming asserts that Nebraska's failure to regulate groundwater
pumping within its own borders precludes Nebraska from seeking
pumping limitations in Wyoming. However, Wyoming alleges no injury
to its interests caused by the downstream pumping, and the effect that
any such injury would have on the relief Nebraska is seeking is a question for trial. Pp. 14-15.

(f) Both the United States and Nebraska take exception to the recommendation that Wyoming's Fourth Amended Cross-Claim--which alleges that federal management of reservoirs has contravened state and
federal law as well as contracts governing water supply to individual
users--be allowed to proceed. Although the 1945 decree did not apportion storage water, a predicate to that decree was that the United States
adhered to beneficial use limitations in administering storage water contracts. Wyoming's assertion that the United States no longer does so,
and that this change has caused or permitted significant injury to Wyoming interests, states a serious claim that ought to go forward. This
claim arises from the decree, and thus cannot be vindicated in district
court litigation between individual contract holders and the United
States. Nor is it likely that this proceeding will be overwhelmed by
the intervention of individual storage contract holders. Since a State
is presumed to speak for its citizens, requests to intervene will be denied
absent a showing, unlikely to be made here, of some compelling interest
not properly represented by the State. Pp. 15-22.

Exceptions overruled.

Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court.
Since 1945, a decree of this Court has rationed the NorthPlatte River among users in Wyoming, Nebraska, and Colorado. By petition in 1986, Nebraska again brought the mat-ter before us, and we appointed a Special Master to conduct
the appropriate proceedings. In his Third Interim Reporton Motions to Amend Pleadings (Sept. 9, 1994) (hereinafter
Third Interim Report), the Master has made recommenda-tions for rulings on requests for leave to amend filed by Nebraska and Wyoming. We now have before us the parties'exceptions to the Master's report, each of which we overrule.

I
The North Platte River is a nonnavigable stream rising innorthern Colorado and flowing through Wyoming into Nebraska, where it joins with the South Platte to form thePlatte River. In 1934, Nebraska invoked our original jurisdiction under the Constitution, Art. III, $ 2, cl. 2, by suingWyoming for an equitable apportionment of the North
Platte. The United States had leave to intervene, Coloradowas impleaded as a defendant, and the ensuing litigation cul*Briefs of amici curiae were filed for the Basin Electric Power Cooperative by Edward Weinberg, Richmond F. Allan, Michael J. Hinman, and
Claire Olson; and for the Platte River Trust by Abbe David Lowell.

minated in the decision and decree in Nebraska v. Wyoming,325 U. S. 589 (1945)

(Nebraska I).
We concluded that the doctrine of prior appropriationshould serve as the general "guiding principle" in our allocation of the North Platte's flows, id., at 618, but resisted
an inflexible application of that doctrine in rendering fourprincipal rulings.

Ibid. First, we enjoined Colorado and
Wyoming from diverting or storing water above prescribedamounts, meant to reflect existing uses, on the river's upper

reaches. Id., at 621-625, 665-666. Second, we set priori-ties among Wyoming canals that divert water for the use of
Nebraska irrigators and federal reservoirs, also in Wyoming,
that store water for Wyoming and Nebraska irrigation districts. Id., at 625-637, 666-667. Third, we apportioned the
natural irrigation-season flows in a stretch of river that
proved to be the principal focus of the litigation (the "pivotal
reach" of 41 miles between the Guernsey Dam in Wyoming
and the Tri-State Dam in Nebraska), allocating 75 percent of
those flows to Nebraska and 25 percent to Wyoming. Id.,
at 637-654, 667-669. Finally, we held that any party could
apply for amendment of the decree or for further relief.
Id., at 671 (Decree Paragraph XIII). With the parties' stipulation, the decree has since been modified once, to account
for the construction of the Glendo Dam and Reservoir.
Nebraska v. Wyoming, 345 U. S. 981 (1953).

Nebraska returned to this Court in 1986 seeking additional relief under the decree, alleging that Wyoming was
threatening its equitable apportionment, primarily by planning water projects on tributaries that have historically
added significant flows to the pivotal reach. We granted
Nebraska leave to file its petition, 479 U. S. 1051 (1987), and
allowed Wyoming to file a counterclaim, 481 U. S. 1011 (1987).

Soon thereafter, Wyoming made a global motion for summary judgment, which the Master in his First Interim Report recommended be denied. See First Interim Report of
Special Master, O. T. 1988, No. 108 Orig. After engaging

Opinion of the Court
in discovery, Nebraska, Wyoming, Colorado, and the UnitedStates all filed further summary judgment motions. In his

Second Interim Report, the Master recommended that wegrant the motions of the United States and Nebraska in part,
but that we otherwise deny summary relief. See Second Interim Report of Special Master on Motions for SummaryJudgment and Renewed Motions for Intervention, O. T. 1991,

No. 108 Orig. We overruled the parties' exceptions. Nebraska v. Wyoming, 507 U. S. 584 (1993) (Nebraska II).

Nebraska and Wyoming then sought leave to amend theirpleadings, and we referred those requests to the Master.

The Amended Petition that Nebraska seeks to file contains
four counts. Count I alleges that Wyoming is depleting the
natural flows of the North Platte and asks for an injunction
against constructing storage capacity on the river's tributaries and "permitting unlimited depletion of groundwater that
is hydrologically connected to the North Platte River and
its tributaries." App. to Third Interim Report D-2 to D-7.
Count II alleges that the United States is operating the
Glendo Reservoir in violation of the decree and seeks an
order holding the United States to the decree. Id., at D-7
to D-8. Count III alleges that Wyoming water projects and
groundwater development threaten to deplete the Laramie
River's contributions to the North Platte, and asks the Court
to "specify that the inflows of the Laramie River below
Wheatland are a component of the equitable apportionment
of the natural flows in the [pivotal] reach, 75% to Nebraska
and 25% to Wyoming, and [to] enjoin the State of Wyoming
from depleting Nebraska's equitable share of the Laramie
River's contribution to the North Platte River . . . ." Id., at
D-8 to D-12. Count IV seeks an equitable apportionment
of the North Platte's nonirrigation season flows. Id., at
D-12 to D-16. The Master recommended that we allow Nebraska to substitute the first three counts of its Amended
Petition for its current petition, but that we deny leave to
file Count IV. Neither Nebraska nor the United States has

Opinion of the Court
excepted to the Master's recommendation, whereas Wyo-ming has filed three exceptions, set out in detail below.

Wyoming proposes to amend its pleading with four coun-terclaims and five cross-claims. The First Counterclaim and
Cross-Claim allege that Nebraska and the United States
have failed to recognize beneficial use limitations on diver-sions by Nebraska canals, and that Nebraska (with the acquiescence of the United States) has violated the equitable ap-portionment by demanding natural flow and storage water
from sources above Tri-State Dam and diverting them foruse below Tri-State Dam. App. to Third Interim Report
E-3 to E-6, E-8 to E-10. Wyoming's Second and Third
Counterclaims and Cross-Claims seek enforcement or modification of Paragraph XVII of the decree, which deals with
the operation of the Glendo Reservoir and is also the subject
of Count II of Nebraska's Amended Petition. Id., at E-6 to
E-7, E-10 to E-11. By its Fourth Counterclaim and Fifth
Cross-Claim, Wyoming asks the Court to modify the decree
to leave the determination of carriage (or transportation)
losses to state officials under state law. Id., at E-7 to E-8,
E-12. Finally, Wyoming's Fourth Cross-Claim alleges that
the United States has failed to operate its storage reservoirs
in accordance with federal and state law and its own storage
water contracts, thus upsetting the very basis of the decree's
equitable apportionment. Id., at E-11 to E-12.

The Master recommended that we allow Wyoming to substitute its Second through Fourth Counterclaims and its Second through Fifth Cross-Claims for its current pleadings, but
that we deny leave to file Wyoming's First Counterclaim and
Cross-Claim insofar as they seek to impose a beneficial use
limitation on Nebraska's diversions of natural flow. The
United States and Nebraska except to the recommendation
to allow Wyoming to file its Fourth Cross-Claim. Wyoming
excepts to the Master's recommended disposition of its First
Counterclaim and Cross-Claim. In all, then, Wyoming has
filed four exceptions to the Master's recommendations and

the United States and Nebraska a single (and largely over-lapping) exception each.

II
We have found that the solicitude for liberal amendmentof pleadings animating the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,

Rule 15(a); Foman v. Davis, 371 U. S. 178, 182 (1962), doesnot suit cases within this Court's original jurisdiction.

Ohiov. Kentucky, 410 U. S. 641, 644 (1973); cf. this Court's Rule

17.2. The need for a less complaisant standard follows fromour traditional reluctance to exercise original jurisdiction
in any but the most serious of circumstances, even where,as in cases between two or more States, our jurisdiction is
exclusive. Mississippi v. Louisiana, 506 U. S. 73, 77 (1992)(" `The model case for invocation of this Court's original jurisdiction is a dispute between States of such seriousnessthat it would amount to

casus belli if the States were fullysovereign,' " quoting
Texas v. New Mexico, 462 U. S. 554, 571,n. 18 (1983)); New York v. New Jersey, 256 U. S. 296, 309

(1921) ("Before this court can be moved to exercise its ex-traordinary power under the Constitution to control the conduct of one State at the suit of another, the threatened inva-sion of rights must be of serious magnitude and it must be
established by clear and convincing evidence"). Our re-quirement that leave be obtained before a complaint may be
filed in an original action, see this Court's Rule 17.3, servesan important gatekeeping function, and proposed pleading
amendments must be scrutinized closely in the first instanceto see whether they would take the litigation beyond what
we reasonably anticipated when we granted leave to file theinitial pleadings. See

Ohio v. Kentucky, supra, at 644.Accordingly, an understanding of the scope of this litigation as envisioned under the initial pleadings is the criticalfirst step in our consideration of the motions to amend. We
have, in fact, already discussed the breadth of the currentlitigation at some length in reviewing the Special Master's
First and Second Interim Reports, Nebraska II, 507 U. S.,

Opinion of the Court
at 590-593, where we concluded that this litigation is not
restricted "solely to enforcement of rights determined in the
prior proceedings," id., at 592. To the contrary, we observed that in Paragraph XIII of the decree, we had retained
jurisdiction "to modify the decree to answer unresolved
questions and to accommodate `change[s] in conditions'--a
phrase sufficiently broad to encompass not only changes in
water supply, . . . but also new development that threatens a
party's interests." Id., at 591, citing Nebraska I, 325 U. S.,
at 620. The parties may therefore not only seek to enforce
rights established by the decree, but may also ask for "a
reweighing of equities and an injunction declaring new
rights and responsibilities . . . ." 507 U. S., at 593. We
made it clear, however, that while "Paragraph XIII perhaps
eases a [party's] burden of establishing, as an initial matter,
that a claim [for modification] is `of that character and dignity
which makes the controversy a justiciable one under our
original jurisdiction,' " ibid., quoting Nebraska I, supra, at
610, the "[party] still must make a showing of substantial
injury to be entitled to relief," 507 U. S., at 593.

We think the Master appreciated these conclusions about
the scope of this litigation when he assessed the proposed
amendments to pleadings to see whether they sought enforcement of the decree or plausibly alleged a change in conditions sufficient to justify its modification. See Third Interim Report 33-36. The parties, of course, do not wholly
agree with us, as they indicate by their exceptions, to which
we turn.

III

A

Wyoming's First Amended Counterclaim alleges that "Nebraska has circumvented and violated the equitable apportionment by demanding natural flow water for diversion by
irrigation canals at and above Tri-State Dam in excess of the
beneficial use requirements of the Nebraska lands entitled to

515us1$63M 08-11-98 16:46:59 PAGES OPINPGT
10 NEBRASKA v. WYOMING

Opinion of the Court
water from those canals under the Decree . . . ." App. toThird Interim Report E-4. Wyoming's First Amended

Cross-Claim alleges that the United States "has circum-vented and violated the equitable apportionment, and continues to do so, by operating the federal reservoirs to deliver
natural flow water for diversion by Nebraska irrigation ca-nals at and above Tri-State Dam in excess of the beneficial

use requirements of the lands entitled to water from thosecanals under the Decree . . . ."

Id., at E-8. The Master
recommended that we deny leave to inject these claims intothe litigation, concluding that Wyoming's object is to transform the 1945 apportionment from a proportionate sharing
of the natural flows in the pivotal reach to a scheme based
on the beneficial use requirements of the pivotal reach irrigators. Third Interim Report 55-64. Wyoming excepts to
the recommendation, claiming that its amendments do no
more than elaborate on the suggestion made in the counterclaim that we allowed it to file in 1987, that Nebraska irrigators are wasting water diverted in the pivotal reach. But
there is more to the amendments than that, and we agree
with the Master that Wyoming in reality is calling for a fundamental modification of the settled apportionment scheme
established in 1945, without alleging a change in conditions
that would arguably justify so bold a step.

In Nebraska II we rejected any notion that our 1945 decision and decree "impose absolute ceilings on diversions by
canals taking in the pivotal reach." 507 U. S., at 602. We
found that although the irrigation requirements of the lands
served by the canals were calculated in the prior proceedings, those calculations were used to "determin[e] the appropriate apportionment of the pivotal reach, not to impose
a cap on the canals' total diversions, either individually or
cumulatively." Ibid. This was clearly indicated, we observed, by the fact that "Paragraph V of the decree, which
sets forth the apportionment, makes no mention of diversion
ceilings and expressly states that Nebraska is free to allocate

11Cite as: 515 U. S. 1 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
its share among its canals as it sees fit." Id., at 603, citingNebraska I, supra, at 667.

These conclusions about our 1945 decision and decree ex-pose the true nature of Wyoming's amended claims. Simply
put, Wyoming seeks to replace a simple apportionmentscheme with one in which Nebraska's share would be capped
at the volume of probable beneficial use, presumably to Wyo-ming's advantage. Wyoming thus seeks nothing less than
relitigation of the "main controversy" of the 1945 litigation,the equitable apportionment of irrigation-season flows in the
North Platte's pivotal reach. See 325 U. S., at 637-638.Under any circumstance, we would be profoundly reluctant
to revisit such a central question supposedly resolved 50years ago, and there can be no temptation to do so here, in
the absence of any allegation of a change in conditions thatmight warrant reexamining the decree's apportionment
scheme. Wyoming's first exception is overruled.1

B
Counts I and III of Nebraska's Amended Petition wouldhave us modify the decree to enjoin proposed developments

by Wyoming on the North Platte's tributaries, see App. toThird Interim Report D-4 to D-6, D-9 to D-11, on the the1 The Master explicitly noted that his recommendation should not be
understood as foreclosing Wyoming from litigating discrete matters captured within its First Amended Counterclaim and the First Amended
Cross-Claim that do not involve relitigation of the 1945 decision but rather
go to the enforcement of the decree. Third Amended Report 63. Specifically, these matters include Wyoming's claim that Nebraska has circumvented the decree by calling for upstream flows for the use of irrigators
diverting water below the Tri-State Dam; Wyoming's claim of waste by
pivotal reach irrigators offered as a defense to Nebraska's objections to
Wyoming uses upstream; and Wyoming's claim that Nebraska canal calls
and natural flow diversions by the United States contravene priorities
established in Paragraph IV of the decree. Id., at 63-64. Neither the
United States nor Nebraska has objected to the Master's recommendation
in this respect.

515us1$63M 08-11-98 16:46:59 PAGES OPINPGT
12 NEBRASKA v. WYOMING

Opinion of the Court
ory that these will deplete the tributaries' contributions tothe mainstem, and hence upset "the equitable balance of the

North Platte River established in the Decree," id., at D-5,D-10. Wyoming's second exception takes issue with the
Master's stated intention to consider a broad array of downstream interests in passing on Nebraska's claims, and to hearevidence of injury not only to downstream irrigators, but

also to wildlife and wildlife habitat. Third Interim Report14, 17, 19, 26.

Consideration of this evidence, Wyoming argues, wouldrun counter to our denial of two earlier motions to amend
filed by Nebraska: its 1988 motion, 485 U. S. 931, by which it
expressly sought modification of the decree to make Wyoming and Colorado share the burden of providing instream
flows necessary to preserve critical wildlife habitat, and its
1991 motion, see 507 U. S. 1049 (1993), in which it sought an
apportionment of nonirrigation-season flows. Wyoming also
suggests that allegations of injury to wildlife are as yet
purely speculative and would be best left to other forums.

Wyoming's arguments are not persuasive. To assign an
affirmative obligation to protect wildlife is one thing; to consider all downstream effects of upstream development when
assessing threats to equitable apportionment is quite another. As we have discussed above, Nebraska II makes it
clear that modification of the decree (as by enjoining developments on tributaries) will follow only upon a "balancing of
equities," 507 U. S., at 592, and that Nebraska will have to
make a showing of "substantial injury" before we will grant
it such relief, id., at 593. There is no warrant for placing
entire categories of evidence beyond Nebraska's reach when
it attempts to satisfy this burden, which is far from
insignificant.

Nor does our resistance to Nebraska's efforts to bring
about broad new apportionments (as of nonirrigation-season
flows) alter this conclusion. Here, Nebraska seeks only to
have us enjoin discrete Wyoming developments. If Ne515us1$63M 08-11-98 16:46:59 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
braska is to have a fair opportunity to present its case forour doing so, we do not understand how we can preclude it

from setting forth that evidence of environmental injury, orconsign it to producing that evidence in some other forum,
since this is the only Court in which Nebraska can challengethe Wyoming projects. And as for Wyoming's argument
that any proof of environmental injury that Nebraska willpresent will be highly speculative, the point is urged prematurely. Purely speculative harms will not, of course, carryNebraska's burden of showing substantial injury, but at this
stage we certainly have no basis for judging Nebraska'sproof, and no justification for denying Nebraska the chance
to prove what it can. C

Wyoming's third exception is to the Master's recommen-dation to allow Nebraska to proceed with its challenge to
Wyoming's actions on Horse Creek, a tributary that flowsinto the North Platte below the Tri-State Dam. In Count I
of its Amended Petition, Nebraska alleges that Wyoming is"presently violating and threatens to violate" Nebraska's equitable apportionment "by depleting the natural flows of theNorth Platte River by such projects as . . . reregulating reservoirs and canal linings in the . . . Horse Creek ConservancyDistrict." App. to Third Interim Report D-5. Nebraska
asks for an injunction against Wyoming's depletions of thecreek.

Wyoming argues that the claim is simply not germane tothis case, since Horse Creek feeds into the North Platte
below the apportioned reach, the downstream boundary ofwhich is the Tri-State Dam. It is clear, however, that the
territorial scope of the case extends downstream of the piv-otal reach. In the 1945 decision and decree, we held against
apportioning that stretch of river between the Tri-StateDam and Bridgeport, Nebraska, not because it fell outside
the geographic confines of the case, but because its neededwater was "adequately supplied from return flows and other

14 NEBRASKA v. WYOMING

Opinion of the Court
local sources." Nebraska I, 325 U. S., at 654-655. In soconcluding, we had evidence that return flows from Horse

Creek provided an average annual contribution of 21,900acre-feet of water to the North Platte during the irrigation
season. Third Interim Report 42.Now Nebraska alleges that Wyoming's actions threaten
serious depletion of these return flows, with consequent in-jury to its interests in the region below the Tri-State Dam.
These allegations describe a change in conditions sufficient,if proven, to warrant the injunctive relief sought, and
Nebraska is accordingly entitled to proceed with its claim.Wyoming's third exception is overruled.

D
In Counts I and III of its Amended Petition, Nebraskaalleges that increased groundwater pumping within Wyoming threatens substantial depletion of the natural flow ofthe river. This allegation is obviously one of a change in
conditions posing a threat of significant injury, and Wyomingconcedes that "groundwater pumping in Wyoming can and
does in fact deplete surface water flows in the North PlatteRiver," Third Interim Report 38. In excepting nevertheless to the Master's recommendation that we allow the claimto go forward, Wyoming raises Nebraska's failure to regulate
groundwater pumping within its own borders, which is saidto preclude Nebraska as a matter of equity from seeking limitations on pumping within Wyoming.We fail to see how the mere fact of unregulated pumping
within Nebraska can serve to bar Nebraska's claim. Ne-braska is the downstream State and claims that Wyoming's
pumping hurts it; Wyoming is upstream and has yet to makea showing that Nebraska's pumping hurts it or anyone else.
If Wyoming ultimately makes such a showing, it could wellaffect the relief to which Nebraska is entitled, but that is a
question for trial, and does not stop Nebraska from amend-ing its claims at this stage.

Opinion of the Court
Wyoming's reliance on two of this Court's prior originalcases is, at best, premature. Both cases were decided after

trial, see Kansas v. Colorado, 206 U. S. 46, 49, 105 (1907);Missouri v. Illinois, 200 U. S. 496, 518 (1906), and while both
recognize that relief on the merits may turn on the equities,206 U. S., at 104-105, 113-114; 200 U. S., at 522, the application of that principle to Nebraska's claim is not, as we havejust stated, obvious at this point. We accordingly accept the
Master's recommendation, Third Interim Report 41, andoverrule Wyoming's fourth exception.

IV
Wyoming's Fourth Amended Cross-Claim seeks declara-tory and injunctive relief and is aimed against the United

States alone, alleging that federal management of reser-voirs has contravened state and federal law as well as contracts governing water supply to individual users. Wyo-ming claims that "the United States has allocated storage
water in a manner which (a) upsets the equitable balance onwhich the apportionment of natural flow was based, (b) results in the allocation of natural flow contrary to the provi-sions of the Decree . . . , (c) promotes inefficiency and waste
of water contrary to federal and state law, (d) violates thecontract rights of the North Platte Project Irrigation Districts and violates the provisions of the Warren Act, 43U. S. C. $ 523, . . . and (e) exceeds the limitations in the
contracts under the Warren Act." App. to Third InterimReport E-11 to E-12. Wyoming alleges that this mismanagement has made "water shortages . . . more frequen[t] and. . . more severe, thereby causing injury to Wyoming and
its water users." Id., at E-12.The United States and Nebraska except to allowing Wyoming's cross-claim to proceed, for two reasons. They argue,first, that the decree expressly refrained from apportioning
storage water, as distinct from natural flow, with the conse-quence that the violations alleged are not cognizable in an

515us1$63M 08-11-98 16:46:59 PAGES OPINPGT
16 NEBRASKA v. WYOMING

Opinion of the Court
action brought under the decree. Second, they maintain
that any claim turning on the United States's failure to comply with individual contracts for the release of storage water
ought to be relegated to an action brought by individual contract holders in a federal district court and that, indeed, just
such an action is currently pending in Goshen Irrigation
District v. United States, No. C89-0161-J (D. Wyo., filed
June 23, 1989).

The Master addressed both objections. As to the first, he
said that "even though the decree did not apportion storage
water, it was framed based in part on assumptions about
storage water rights and deliveries," and that therefore
"Wyoming should have the opportunity to go forward with
her claims that the United States has violated the law and
contracts rights and that such violations have the effect of
undermining Wyoming's apportionment." Third Interim
Report 70. The Master found the second point "unpersuasive" because "neither Wyoming nor Nebraska [is a party] to
the [Goshen] case [brought by the individual contractors],
and the federal district court, therefore, does not have jurisdiction to consider whether any violations that may be
proven on the part of the United States will have the effect
of undermining the 1945 apportionment decree." Id., at 71.
We agree with the Master on both counts.

The availability of storage water and its distribution under
storage contracts was a predicate to the original apportionment decree. Our 1945 opinion expressly recognized the
significance of storage water to the lands irrigated by the
pivotal reach, noting that over the prior decade storage
water was on average over half of the total supply and that
over 90 percent of the irrigated lands had storage rights as
well as rights to natural flow. Nebraska I, 325 U. S., at 605.
We pointed out that Nebraska appropriators in the pivotal
reach had "greater storage water rights" than Wyoming appropriators, id., at 645, a fact that helped "tip the scales in

17Cite as: 515 U. S. 1 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
favor of the flat percentage system," as against a scheme
even more favorable to Nebraska, ibid.

In rejecting Wyoming's original proposal, which was to
combine water from storage and natural flow and apportion
both by volume among the different users, id., at 621, we
anticipated that the storage supply would "be left for distribution in accordance with the contracts which govern it," id.,
at 631. In doing so, we were clearly aware of the beneficial
use limitations that govern federal contracts for storage
water. Contracts between the United States and individual
water users on the North Platte, we pointed out, had been
made and were maintained in compliance with $ 8 of the Reclamation Act of 1902, 32 Stat. 388, 43 U. S. C. $$ 372, 383,
which provided that " `the right to the use of water acquired
under the provisions of this Act shall be appurtenant to the
land irrigated, and beneficial use shall be the basis, the measure, and the limit of the right.' " 325 U. S., at 613. In addition, contracts had been made under the Warren Act, 36 Stat.
925, 43 U. S. C. $$ 523-525, which granted the Secretary of
the Interior the further power to contract for the storage
and delivery of water available in excess of the requirements
of any given project managed under the Reclamation Act.
See Nebraska I, supra, at 631, 639-640.

Under this system, access to water from storage facilities
was only possible by a contract for its use, Nebraska I, 325
U. S., at 640, and apportionment of storage water would have
disrupted that system. "If storage water is not segregated,
storage water contractors in times of shortage of the total
supply will be deprived of the use of a part of the storage
supply for which they pay . . . [and] those who have not contracted for the storage supply will receive at the expense of
those who have contracted for it a substantial increment to
the natural flow supply which, as we have seen, has been
insufficient to go around." Ibid. Hence, we refrained from
apportioning stored water and went no further than capping

18 NEBRASKA v. WYOMING

Opinion of the Court
the total amount of storage in certain dams to protect senior,
downstream rights to natural flow. Id., at 630. But although our refusal in 1945 to apportion storage water was
driven by a respect for the statutory and contractual regime
in place at the time, we surely did not dismiss storage water
as immaterial to the proper allocation of the natural flow in
the pivotal reach. And while our decree expressly protected those with rights to storage water, it did so on the
condition that storage water would continue to be distributed "in accordance with . . . lawful contracts . . . ." Id., at
669. This is the very condition that Wyoming now seeks
to vindicate.

Wyoming argues that the United States no longer abides
by the governing law in administering the storage water contracts. First, it contends that the Government pays no heed
to federal law's beneficial use limitations on the disposition
of storage water but rather "releas[es] storage water on demand to the canals in the pivotal reach without regard to
how the water is used." Brief for Wyoming in Response to
Exceptions of Nebraska and United States to Third Interim
Report 6 (emphasis deleted) (hereinafter Response Brief).
This liberality allegedly harms Wyoming contractees whose
storage supply is wasted, as well as junior Wyoming appropriators who are subject to the senior call of the United
States to refill the reservoirs and are consequently deprived
of the natural flow they would otherwise receive.

Second, Wyoming claims that federal policy in drought
years encourages contract users to exploit this failure of the
Government to police consumption. It points out that in
years of insufficient supply, the United States has calculated
each water district's average use of storage water in prior
years, and then allocated to each district a certain percentage of that average, according to what the overall supply
will bear. The United States has then further reduced the
allotment of each individual canal within a district by the

Opinion of the Court
amount of natural flow delivered to the canal, with the resultthat in dry years water is distributed under "purely a mass

[i. e., fixed volume] allocation that sets a cap on the totaldiversion of each individual canal."

Id., at 8. Wyoming
thus contends not only that under this system "in a dry year
like 1989 the [United States's] allocation effectively replacesthe Court decreed 75/25 apportionment,"

id., at 9, but that
the departure from the norm is needlessly great because thesystem "encourages individual canals to divert as much

water as possible during `non-allocation' years in order tomaximize their average diversions which will be the measure
of their entitlement in a subsequent dry year allocation,"
id., at 8, n. 6.

If Wyoming were arguing merely that any administration
of storage water that takes account of fluctuations in the nat-ural flow received by a contractee violates the decree, we

would reject its claim, for we recognized in 1945 that theoutstanding Warren Act contracts contained "agree[ments]
to deliver water which will, with all the water to which theland is entitled by appropriation or otherwise, aggregate a
stated amount." 325 U. S., at 631. Indeed, we set forth anexample of just such a contract in our opinion.

Id., at 631,
n. 17. In asserting, however, that a predicate to the 1945
decree was that the United States adhered to beneficial uselimitations in administering storage water contracts, that it

no longer does so, and that this change has caused or permit-ted significant injury to Wyoming interests, Wyoming has
said enough to state a serious claim that ought to be allowed
to go forward.2

2 The dissent would disallow Wyoming's cross-claim on the grounds that
Wyoming seeks neither to modify the decree (because it asks only for an
injunction requiring the United States to adhere to its contracts and to
the federal and state law governing storage water) nor to enforce it (since
the decree presently contains no such mandate). This leaves Wyoming
hanging. It cannot sue under the decree because a mandate of compliance

20 NEBRASKA v. WYOMING

Opinion of the Court
Although the claim may well require consideration of individual contracts and compliance with the Reclamation and
Warren Acts, it does not follow (as Nebraska and the United
States argue) that Wyoming is asserting the private contractors' rights proper, or (as the United States contends) that
Wyoming brings suit " `in reality for the benefit of particular
individuals,' " Brief for United States in Support of Exception 25, quoting Oklahoma ex rel. Johnson v. Cook, 304 U. S.
387, 393-394 (1938). Wyoming argues only that the cumulative effect of the United States's failure to adhere to the law
governing the contracts undermines the operation of the decree, see Response Brief 14-21, and thereby states a claim
arising under the decree itself, one by which it seeks to vindicate its " `quasi-sovereign' interests which are `independent of and behind the titles of its citizens, in all the earth
and air within its domain,' " Oklahoma ex rel. Johnson v.
Cook, supra, at 393, quoting Georgia v. Tennessee Copper
Co., 206 U. S. 230, 237 (1907).

It is of no moment that some of the contracts could be
made (or are) the subject of litigation between individual
contract holders and the United States in federal district
court. Wyoming is not a party to any such litigation and, as

is not included in it, yet it cannot seek modification of the decree to include
such a mandate, apparently because such relief is not sufficiently drastic.
Post, at 24-26.

It seems very clear to us, however, that Wyoming is seeking a modification of the decree in order to enforce its predicate. As the dissent concedes, our 1945 decision could conceivably afford a "basis for ordering the
United States to comply with applicable riparian law and with its storage
contracts . . . ." Post, at 25-26. The dissent then rightly points out that
such a position would be weak because the decree did not expressly mandate the compliance with lawful contracts and governing law that we anticipated in 1945. Ibid. Wyoming's Fourth Cross-Claim, however, now
seeks just such a mandate by modifying the decree to require the United
States to comply with its own contracts and with the federal and state law
governing storage water.

Opinion of the Court
counsel for the United States acknowledged at oral argument, it is uncertain whether the State would qualify for
intervention in the ongoing Goshen litigation under Federal
Rule of Civil Procedure 24. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 46. While
the uncertainty of intervention is beside the point on the
dissent's view, which "see[s] no reason . . . why Wyoming
could not institute its own action against the United States
in [district court]," post, at 27, the dissent nowhere explains
how Wyoming would have standing to bring an action under
storage water contracts to which it is not a party. As we
have just said, Wyoming's claim derives not from rights
under individual contracts but from the decree, and the
decree can be modified only by this Court. Putting aside,
then, whether another forum might offer relief that, as a
practical matter, would mitigate the alleged ill effects of the
National Government's contract administration, this is the
proper forum for the State's claim, and it makes sense to
entertain the claim in the course of adjudicating the broader
controversy among Wyoming, Nebraska, and the United
States. Cf. United States v. Nevada, 412 U. S. 534, 537
(1973) (per curiam) (denying motion for leave to file bill of
complaint in part because "[t]here is now no controversy
between the two States with respect to the . . . [r]iver [in
question]").

Nor do we fear the specter, raised by the United States, of
intervention by many individual storage contractors in this
proceeding. Ordinarily, in a suit by one State against another subject to the original jurisdiction of this Court, each
State "must be deemed to represent all its citizens." Kentucky v. Indiana, 281 U. S. 163, 173 (1930). A State is presumed to speak in the best interests of those citizens, and
requests to intervene by individual contractees may be
treated under the general rule that an individual's motion
for leave to intervene in this Court will be denied absent a
"showing [of] some compelling interest in his own right,

Opinion of the Court
apart from his interest in a class with all other citizens and
creatures of the state, which interest is not properly represented by the state." New Jersey v. New York, 345 U. S.
369, 373 (1953); cf. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 24(a)(2). We have
said on many occasions that water disputes among States
may be resolved by compact or decree without the participation of individual claimants, who nonetheless are bound by
the result reached through representation by their respective States. Nebraska I, 325 U. S., at 627, citing Hinderlider v. La Plata River & Cherry Creek Ditch Co., 304 U. S.
92, 106-108 (1938); see also Wyoming v. Colorado, 286 U. S.
494, 508-509 (1932). As we view the litigation at the current time, it is unlikely to present occasion for individual
storage contract holders to show that their proprietary interests are not adequately represented by their State.

Two caveats are nonetheless in order, despite our allowance of Wyoming's cross-claim. Nebraska argues that Wyoming is using its cross-claim as a back door to achieving the
mass allocation of natural flows sought in its First Counterclaim and Cross-Claim. This argument will be difficult to
assess without further development of the merits, and we
can only emphasize at this point that in allowing Wyoming's
Fourth Cross-Claim to go forward, we are not, of course, in
any way sanctioning the very modification of the decree that
we have just ruled out in this proceeding. Second, the parties should not take our allowance of the Fourth Cross-Claim
as an opportunity to enquire into every detail of the United
States's administration of storage water contracts. The
United States's contractual compliance is not, of itself, an
appropriate subject of the Special Master's attention, which
is properly confined to the effects of contract administration
on the operation of the decree. Contractual compliance, as
such, is the subject of the Goshen litigation, which we presume will move forward independently of this original
action.

Opinion of Thomas, J.

V
For these reasons, the exceptions to the Special Master'sThird Interim Report are overruled.

It is so ordered.
Justice Thomas, concurring in part and dissenting inpart.

I agree with the decision of the Court to overrule all ofWyoming's exceptions to the Third Interim Report on Motions to Amend Pleading (Report). Accordingly, I join PartsI, II, and III of the Court's opinion. I do not agree, however, that we should overrule the exceptions of the UnitedStates and Nebraska to the Master's recommendation that
Wyoming be allowed to proceed with its proposed FourthCross-Claim against the United States. I would sustain
those exceptions and require Wyoming to pursue that claimin another forum.

Wyoming's Fourth Cross-Claim begins with the followingallegation:

"The equitable apportionment which the Decree wasintended to carry into effect was premised in part on the
assumption that the United States would operate thefederal reservoirs and deliver storage water in accordance with applicable federal and state law and in accord-ance with the contracts governing use of water from the
federal reservoirs." App. to Report E-11.
Wyoming then alleges generally that "[t]he United Stateshas failed to operate the federal reservoirs in accordance

with applicable federal and state laws and has failed to abideby the contracts governing use of water from the federal
reservoirs." Ibid. According to Wyoming, these failureshave "caused water shortages to occur more frequently and
to be more severe, thereby causing injury to Wyoming andits water users."

Id., at E-12. In short, Wyoming alleges

515us1$63N 08-11-98 16:47:00 PAGES OPINPGT
24 NEBRASKA v. WYOMING

Opinion of Thomas, J.
that "a predicate to the 1945 decree was that the United
States adhered to [riparian law's] beneficial use limitations
in administering storage water contracts, that it no longer
does so, and that this change has caused or permitted significant injury to Wyoming interests." Ante, at 19.

In the abstract, these allegations are sufficient to state a
claim for modification of the decree based on changed circumstances. Such relief is authorized by the decree's Paragraph
XIII, which invited the parties to "apply at the foot of this
decree for its amendment or for further relief." Nebraska
v. Wyoming, 325 U. S. 589, 671 (1945) (Nebraska I). In particular, subdivision (f) of Paragraph XIII anticipates that we
might modify the decree in light of "[a]ny change in conditions making modifications of the decree or the granting of
further relief necessary or appropriate." Id., at 672. Thus,
in light of the Federal Government's failure to satisfy our
expectation that it would comply with applicable riparian
law and with its contracts, we might engage in "a reweighing of equities" and accordingly "reope[n]" the 1945 apportionment of the North Platte and modify the decree in
Wyoming's favor. Nebraska v. Wyoming, 507 U. S. 584, 593
(1993) (Nebraska II).

If Wyoming's Fourth Cross-Claim against the United
States had actually sought such relief, I might agree with
the Court's decision to allow the claim to proceed. But the
cross-claim's prayer for relief seeks neither a reapportionment of the North Platte nor any other modification of the
decree. Instead, it asks the Court "to enjoin the United
States' continuing violations of federal and state law and . . .
to direct the United States to comply with the terms of
its contracts." App. to Report E-12. This prayer makes
perfect sense: Why seek to modify the decree based on a
"change in conditions" if such change could be reversed or
annulled by means of injunctive relief grounded in existing
law? Indeed, were existing law sufficient to prevent the in515us1$63N 08-11-98 16:47:00 PAGES OPINPGT

25Cite as: 515 U. S. 1 (1995)
Opinion of Thomas, J.
juries alleged by Wyoming, the State could hardly point tothe "considerable justification" necessary for "reopening an

apportionment of interstate water rights." Nebraska II,
supra, at 593.1

Yet precisely because the injunctive relief requested by
Wyoming arises out of and depends on a body of law that
exists independently of the decree, the Court errs in asserting that Wyoming "states a claim arising under the decree
itself." Ante, at 20. This is so for two reasons. First, a
claim that the United States must comply with applicable
law and with contracts governed by such law--here, $ 8 of
the Reclamation Act of 1902, 32 Stat. 390, 43 U. S. C. $$ 372,
383, the Warren Act, ch. 141, 36 Stat. 925, 43 U. S. C. $$ 523-
525, and other federal and state riparian law, see ante, at
17--necessarily "arises under" that body of law. See, e. g.,
Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal. v. Construction Laborers Vacation Trust for Southern Cal., 463 U. S. 1, 8-9 (1983) (approving, as a principle of inclusion, "Justice Holmes' statement,
`A suit arises under the law that creates the cause of action' "
(quoting American Well Works Co. v. Layne & Bowler Co.,
241 U. S. 257, 260 (1916))).

Second, although a decree entered by this Court could conceivably afford an additional and separate basis for ordering

1 To the Court, "[i]t seems very clear . . . that Wyoming is seeking a
modification of the decree in order to enforce its predicate." Ante, at 20,
n. 2. I would expect such clarity to show in the language of the Fourth
Cross-Claim itself, but the prayer for relief notably fails to include the
word "modify" or its synonyms. In this regard, the Fourth Cross-Claim
stands in marked contrast to Wyoming's other cross-claims and its counterclaims against Nebraska. Compare App. to Report E-12 (Fourth
Cross-Claim's prayer for relief) with id., at E-6, E-7, E-8, E-10, E-11,
E-12 (other prayers). Wyoming is not left "hanging" by its failure to
seek a modification of the decree as to the United States' compliance with
applicable riparian law and with its contracts. Ante, at 19-20, n. 2. As
I explain infra, at 27-28, the State may seek its requested relief in another forum.

515us1$63N 08-11-98 16:47:00 PAGES OPINPGT
26 NEBRASKA v. WYOMING

Opinion of Thomas, J.
the United States to comply with applicable riparian law and
with its storage contracts, our 1945 decree in fact does not.
That is, we "anticipated that the storage [water] supply
would `be left for distribution in accordance with the contracts which govern it,' " ante, at 17 (emphasis added) (quoting Nebraska I, 325 U. S., at 631), but we did not mandate
that result. To the contrary, Paragraph VI of the decree
states expressly that "[s]torage water shall not be affected
by this decree" and that storage water shall be distributed
"without interference because of this decree." Id., at 669.
Accord, Brief for Wyoming in Response to Exceptions of Nebraska and the United States 19 ("No one asserted [in 1945]
a need for the Court affirmatively to require the [Federal
Government's] compliance with federal law; such compliance
was assumed").

Because Wyoming's Fourth Cross-Claim against the
United States therefore involves neither "an application for
enforcement of rights already recognized in the decree" nor
a request for "a modification of the decree," Nebraska II,
supra, at 590, I do not understand why the Court chooses to
entertain that claim as part of the present proceeding. It
is well established that "[w]e seek to exercise our original
jurisdiction sparingly and are particularly reluctant to take
jurisdiction of a suit where the plaintiff has another adequate
forum in which to settle his claim." United States v. Nevada, 412 U. S. 534, 538 (1973) (per curiam). This particular reluctance applies squarely to "controversies between the
United States and a State," of which we have "original but
not exclusive jurisdiction." 28 U. S. C. $ 1251(b)(2) (emphasis added). Thus, in United States v. Nevada, we declined
to exercise jurisdiction over a dispute between those parties
about intrastate water rights, noting that such dispute was
"within the jurisdiction of the District Court" in Nevada.
412 U. S., at 538. Accord, id., at 539-540 ("Any possible dispute with California with respect to United States water

uses in that State can be settled in the lower federal courtsin California . . .").

2

These principles should be applied here. Although Iagree with the Court that the mere existence of pending litigation brought by individual storage contract holders againstthe United States in the Federal District Court in Wyoming
is not dispositive, see ante, at 20-21, I see no reason (and theparties offer none) why Wyoming could not institute its own
action against the United States in that forum.3 Moreover,

2 Our decision in California v. Nevada, 447 U. S. 125 (1980), is also on
point. There, as here, we exercised our exclusive original jurisdiction
over a dispute between two States, but we declined to expand the reference to the Special Master to include borderland ownership and title disputes that "typically will involve only one or the other State and the
United States, or perhaps various citizens of those States." Id., at 133.
Instead, we explained, "litigation in other forums seems an entirely appropriate means of resolving whatever questions remain." Ibid.

Subsequent to our decision in United States v. Nevada in 1973, we have,
in the majority of actions by States against the United States or its officers, summarily denied the motion for leave to file a bill of complaint. See
Georgia v. Nixon, President of the United States, 414 U. S. 810 (1973);
Idaho v. Vance, Secretary of State, 434 U. S. 1031 (1978); Indiana v. United
States, 471 U. S. 1123 (1985); Michigan v. Meese, Attorney General of the
United States, 479 U. S. 1078 (1987); Mississippi v. United States, 499 U. S.
916 (1991). Accord, United States v. Florida, 430 U. S. 140 (1977) (per
curiam) (denying motion by Florida for leave to file counterclaim).

3 The reason cannot be, as the Court seems to think, that "Wyoming's

claim derives not from rights under individual contracts but from the
decree, and the decree can be modified only by this Court." Ante, at 21.
As I have explained, the first of these propositions is not correct. The
second is correct, of course, but also irrelevant: Wyoming seeks not a modification of the decree but an injunction directing the United States to
comply with applicable riparian law and with its contracts, thereby obviating the need for this Court to modify the decree. Thus, by "[p]utting
aside . . . whether another forum might offer relief that, as a practical
matter, would mitigate the alleged ill effects of the National Government's
contract administration," ibid., the Court actually puts aside the only
relief sought by the claim the Court allows to proceed.

As for standing, see ante, at 21, I simply repeat the Court's own
discussion of this subject. In brief, Wyoming's standing is predicated

Opinion of Thomas, J.
given the number and variety of the other new or amendedclaims we have approved today, see ante, at 11-15--not to

mention the issues left unresolved by our 1993 opinion, seeNebraska II, 507 U. S., at 596-603--the significant statutory
and contractual issues raised by Wyoming's cross-claimagainst the United States would most likely be resolved in
the District Court with far greater dispatch. Indeed, thepresent round of litigation has dragged on for almost

nineyears, but we are not even beyond the stage of considering

amendments to the pleadings.Finally, although I share the Court's distaste at the prospect of intervention by individual storage contract holders inthis original action, see

ante, at 21-22, I find it just as dis-tasteful unnecessarily to deny private parties the opportunity to participate in a case the disposition of which mayimpair their interests. By remitting Wyoming's claim to the
District Court, we would allow the storage contract holdersto participate voluntarily by joinder or intervention, see Fed.
Rules Civ. Proc. 20(a) and 24, or to be joined involuntarily inthe interest of just adjudication, see Rule 19.

* * *
The Court's decision to entertain Wyoming's FourthCross-Claim against the United States departs from our established principles for exercising our original jurisdiction,ignores the relief requested by Wyoming, and needlessly
opens the possibility to a reapportionment of the NorthPlatte. In short, it constitutes "a misguided exercise of [our]

NORTH STAR STEEL CO. v. THOMAS et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe third circuit

No. 94-834. Argued April 25, 1995--Decided May 30, 1995*
Respondents filed separate claims under the federal Worker Adjustment

and Retraining Notification Act (WARN), which authorizes a civil enforcement action by aggrieved employees or their union against a covered employer who fails to give 60 days notice of a plant closing or
mass layoff, but provides no limitations period for such an action. In
rejecting petitioner employer's contention that the statute of limitations
had run, the District Court in Crown Cork held that the source of the
limitations period for WARN suits is state law and that respondent
union's suit was timely under any of the arguably applicable Pennsylvania statutes. In North Star, however, another District Court granted
summary judgment for petitioner employer, holding respondent employees' suit barred under a limitations period borrowed from the National
Labor Relations Act, which the court believed was "more analogous" to
WARN than any state law. The Third Circuit consolidated the cases
and held that a WARN limitations period should be borrowed from
state, not federal, law, reversing in North Star and affirming in Crown
Cork.

Held: State law is the proper source of the limitations period for civil

actions brought to enforce WARN. Pp. 33-37.

(a) Where a federal statute fails to provide any limitations period for
a new cause of action, this Court's longstanding and settled practice has
been to borrow the limitations period from the most closely analogous
state statute. A closely circumscribed and narrow exception to this
general rule allows borrowing from elsewhere in federal law when the
arguably relevant state limitations periods would frustrate or interfere
with the implementation of national policies or be at odds with the purpose or operation of federal substantive law. See, e. g., DelCostello v.
Teamsters, 462 U. S. 151, 161, 172. Pp. 33-35.

(b) These cases fall squarely inside the general rule, not the exception. The presumption that state law will be the source of a missing

federal limitations period was already longstanding when WARN was
passed in 1988, justifying the assumption that Congress intended by its
silence that courts borrow state law. Agency Holding Corp. v. MalleyDuff & Associates, Inc., 483 U. S. 143, 147. Accordingly, since the complaints in both of these cases were timely even under the shortest of
the potentially-applicable Pennsylvania statutes of limitations, there is
no need to go beyond the Court of Appeals's decision to choose the best
of the four, and it is enough to say here that none of these statutes
would be at odds with WARN's purpose or operation, or frustrate or
interfere with the intent behind it. DelCostello, supra, at 166, distinguished. Although petitioners are right that the adoption of state limitations periods can result in variations from State to State and encourage forum shopping, these are just the costs of the general rule itself,
and nothing about WARN makes them exorbitant. Agency Holding
Corp., supra, at 149, 153-154, distinguished. Because a state counterpart provides a limitations period without frustrating consequences
here, it is simply beside the point that a perfectly good federal analogue
exists. Pp. 35-37.

Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court.
The Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act
(WARN or Act), 102 Stat. 890, 29 U. S. C. $ 2101 et seq.,
obliges covered employers to give employees or their union
60 days notice of a plant closing or mass layoff. These consolidated cases raise the issue of the proper source of the
limitations period for civil actions brought to enforce the Act.
For actions brought in Pennsylvania, and generally, we hold
it to be state law.

I

With some exceptions and conditions, WARN forbids an
employer of 100 or more employees to "order a plant closing
or mass layoff until the end of a 60-day period after the employer serves written notice of such an order." 29 U. S. C.

$ 2102(a). The employer is supposed to notify, among others,
"each affected employee" or "each representative of the affected employees." 29 U. S. C. $ 2102(a)(1). An employer
who violates the notice provisions is liable for penalties by
way of a civil action that may be brought "in any district
court of the United States for any district in which the violation is alleged to have occurred, or in which the employer
transacts business." $ 2104(a)(5). The class of plaintiffs
includes aggrieved employees (or their unions, as representatives), ibid., who may collect "back pay for each day of
violation," $ 2104(a)(1)(A), "up to a maximum of 60 days,"

laying off 85 employees at its Perry, Georgia, plant in September 1991, without giving the required 60-day notice.
Crown Cork moved for summary judgment, claiming that the
statute of limitations had run. The District Court denied
the motion, holding the source of the limitations period for
WARN suits to be Pennsylvania state law and the union's
suit timely under any of the arguably applicable state statutes. 833 F. Supp. 467 (ED Pa. 1993). The District Court
nevertheless certified the question of the limitations period
for immediate interlocutory appeal under 28 U. S. C. $ 1292.

The North Star respondents are former, nonunion employees of petitioner North Star Steel Company who filed a
WARN claim against the company (also in a Federal District
Court in Pennsylvania) alleging that the company laid off 270
workers at a Pennsylvania plant without giving the 60-day
advance notice. Like Crown Cork, and for like reasons,
North Star also moved for summary judgment. But North
Star was successful, the District Court holding the suit
barred under the 6-month limitations period for unfair labor
practice claims borrowed from the National Labor Relations
Act (NLRA), 49 Stat. 449, 29 U. S. C. $ 160(b), a statute believed by the court to be "more analogous" to WARN than
anything in state law. 838 F. Supp. 970, 974 (MD Pa. 1993).

The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit
consolidated the cases and held that a period of limitations
for WARN should be borrowed from state, not federal, law,
reversing in North Star and affirming in Crown Cork. 32
F. 3d 53 (1994). Like the District Court in Crown Cork,
the Court of Appeals did not pick from among the several
Pennsylvania statutes of limitations that might apply to

WARN, since none of them would have barred either of theactions before it.

The Third Circuit's decision deepened a split among theCourts of Appeals on the issue of WARN's limitations period.
See United Paperworkers Int'l Union v. Specialty Paperboard, Inc., 999 F. 2d 51 (CA2 1993) (applying state-law limi-tations period); Halkias v. General Dynamics Corp., 31 F. 3d

A

A look at this Court's docket in recent years will show howoften federal statutes fail to provide any limitations period

for the causes of action they create, leaving courts to borrowa period, generally from state law, to limit these claims.
See, e. g., Reed v. Transportation Union, 488 U. S. 319 (1989)(claims under $ 101(a)(2) of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, 73 Stat. 522, 29 U. S. C.$ 411(a)(2), governed by state personal injury statutes);
Agency Holding Corp. v. Malley-Duff & Associates, Inc., 483U. S. 143 (1987) (civil actions under Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U. S. C. $ 1964, gov-erned by 4-year statute of limitations of the Clayton Act, 69
Stat. 283, as amended, 15 U. S. C. $ 15b); Wilson v. Garcia,471 U. S. 261 (1985) (civil rights claims under 42 U. S. C.

$ 1983 governed by state statutes of limitations for personalinjury actions);

DelCostello v. Teamsters, 462 U. S. 151 (1983)(hybrid suit by employee against employer for breach of a

collective-bargaining agreement and against union for breachof a duty of fair representation governed by NLRA limitations period). Although these examples show borrowingfrom federal law as well as state, our practice has left no

34 NORTH STAR STEEL CO. v. THOMAS

Opinion of the Court
doubt about the lender of first resort. Since 1830, "statestatutes have repeatedly supplied the periods of limitations

for federal causes of action" when the federal legislationmade no provision, Automobile Workers v. Hoosier Cardinal
Corp., 383 U. S. 696, 703-704 (1966), and in seeking the rightstate rule to apply, courts look to the state statute " `most
closely analogous' " to the federal Act in need, Reed, supra,at 323, quoting

DelCostello, supra, at 158. Because thispenchant to borrow from analogous state law is not only

"longstanding," Agency Holding Corp., supra, at 147, but"settled," Wilson, supra, at 266, "it is not only appropriate
but also realistic to presume that Congress was thoroughlyfamiliar with [our] precedents . . . and that it expect[s] its
enactment[s] to be interpreted in conformity with them,"
Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U. S. 677, 699 (1979).See Agency Holding Corp., supra, at 147.*

There is, of course, a secondary lender, for we have recog-nized "a closely circumscribed . . . [and] narrow exception to
the general rule," Reed, supra, at 324, based on the commonsense that Congress would not wish courts to apply a limitations period that would only stymie the policies underlyingthe federal cause of action. So, when the state limitations
periods with any claim of relevance would " `frustrate or in-terfere with the implementation of national policies,' "

Del-Costello, supra, at 161, quoting Occidental Life Ins. Co. of

Cal. v. EEOC, 432 U. S. 355, 367 (1977), or be "at odds withthe purpose or operation of federal substantive law,"

DelCos-tello, supra, at 161, we have looked for a period that might

be provided by analogous federal law, more in harmony withthe objectives of the immediate cause of action. See, e. g.,
Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind, Prupis & Petigrow v. Gilbertson,501 U. S. 350, 362 (1991); Agency Holding Corp., supra, at

*The expectation is reversed for statutes passed after December 1, 1990,
the effective date of 28 U. S. C. $ 1658 (1988 ed., Supp. V), which supplies
a general, 4-year limitations period for any federal statute subsequently
enacted without one of its own.

Opinion of the Court
153, 156; DelCostello, supra, at 171-172. But the referenceto federal law is the exception, and we decline to follow a

state limitations period "only `when a rule from elsewherein federal law clearly provides a closer analogy than available state statutes, and when the federal policies at stakeand the practicalities of litigation make that rule a significantly more appropriate vehicle for interstitial lawmaking.' "
Reed, supra, at 324, quoting DelCostello, supra, at 172.

B
These cases fall squarely inside the rule, not the exception.The presumption that state law will be the source of a missing federal limitations period was already "longstanding,"
Agency Holding Corp., 483 U. S., at 147, when WARN waspassed in 1988, justifying the assumption that Congress "intend[ed] by its silence that we borrow state law," ibid. Ac-cordingly, the Court of Appeals identified four Pennsylvania
statutes of limitations that might apply to WARN claims: the2-year period for enforcing civil penalties generally, Pa. Stat.
Ann., Tit. 42, $ 5524(5) (Purdon 1981 and 1994 Supp.); the3-year period for claims under the Pennsylvania Wage Payment and Collection Law, Pa. Stat. Ann., Tit. 43, $ 260.9a(g)(Purdon 1992); the 4-year period for breach of an implied
contract, Pa. Stat. Ann., Tit. 42, $ 5525(4) (Purdon 1981); andthe six years under the residual statute of limitations, Pa.
Stat. Ann., Tit. 42, $ 5527 (Purdon 1981 and 1994 Supp.). See32 F. 3d, at 61. Since the complaints in both Crown Cork
and North Star were timely even under the shortest of these,there is no need to go beyond the decision of the Court of
Appeals to choose the best of four, and it is enough to sayhere that none of these potentially applicable statutes would
be "at odds" with WARN's "purpose or operation," or " `frus-trate or interfere with' " the intent behind it.

DelCostello,462 U. S., at 161.

The contrast with DelCostello is clear. There the Courtdeclined to borrow state limitations periods for so-called

515us1$64M 08-11-98 16:50:57 PAGES OPINPGT
36 NORTH STAR STEEL CO. v. THOMAS

Opinion of the Court
"hybrid" claims brought by an employee against both his em-ployer and his union, for the reason that the state-law candidates "typically provide[d] very short times" for suit (gen-erally 90 days) and thus "fail[ed] to provide an aggrieved
employee with a satisfactory opportunity to vindicate his
rights." Id., at 166, and n. 15. Here, the shortest of thearguably usable state periods, however, is two years, which

is not short enough to frustrate an employee seeking reliefunder WARN. At the other end, even the longest of the
periods, six years, is not long enough to frustrate the interestin "a relatively rapid disposition of labor disputes." See
Automobile Workers, supra, at 707 (borrowing a 6-year
state limitations period for claims brought under $ 301 of

the Labor-Management Relations Act).

We do not take petitioners to disagree seriously, for the
heart of their argument is not that the state periods are too
long or too short. They submit instead that, if we look to
state law, WARN litigation presents undue risks of forum
shopping, such that we ought to pick a uniform federal rule
for all claims (with the NLRA, and its 6-month limitations
period for unfair labor practices claims, 29 U. S. C. $ 160(b),
being the federal Act most analogous to WARN). But even
taking petitioners on their own terms, they make no case
for choosing the exception over the rule. They are right, of
course, that the practice of adopting state statutes of limitations for federal causes of action can result in different
limitations periods in different States for the same federal
action, and correct that some plaintiffs will canvass the variations and shop around for a forum. But these are just the
costs of the rule itself, and nothing about WARN makes
them exorbitant.

It is, indeed, true that "practicalities of litigation" influenced our rationale for adopting a uniform federal rule for
civil actions under RICO. Agency Holding Corp., supra, at
153. But WARN's obligations are triggered by a "plant
closing" or a "mass layoff " at a "single site of employment,"

29 U. S. C. $$ 2101(a)(2)-(3), and so, unlike RICO violations,do not "commonly involve interstate transactions."

Agency
Holding Corp., 483 U. S., at 153. WARN thus fails to sharethe "multistate nature" of RICO,

id., at 154, and is so relatively simple and narrow in its scope, see id., at 149 (listing
the many categories of crimes that can be predicate acts fora RICO violation), that "no [comparable] practicalities of

litigation compel us to search beyond state law for a moreanalogous statute of limitations,"

Reed, 488 U. S., at 327.
Since, then, a state counterpart provides a limitations periodwithout frustrating consequences, it is simply beside the

point that even a perfectly good federal analogue exists.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is

Affirmed.
Justice Scalia, concurring in the judgment.
I remain of the view that when Congress has not prescribed a limitations period to govern a cause of action that
it has created, the Court should apply the appropriate state
statute of limitations, or, if doing so would frustrate the
purposes of the federal enactment, no limitations period at

all. See Agency Holding Corp. v. Malley-Duff & Associates, Inc., 483 U. S. 143, 157-170 (1987) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment); see also Reed v. Transportation Union,
488 U. S. 319, 334 (1989) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment).
The rule first announced in DelCostello v. Teamsters, 462
U. S. 151, 172 (1983), that a federal limitations period should
be selected when it presents a "closer analogy" to the federal
cause of action and is "significantly more appropriate," I find
to be not only erroneous but unworkable. If the "closer
analogy" part of this is to be taken seriously, the federal
statute would end up applying in some States but not in others; and the "significantly more appropriate" part is meaningless, since in all honesty a uniform nationwide limitations
period for a federal cause of action is always significantly
more appropriate.

Scalia, J., concurring in judgment
I have joined in applying to a so-called "implied" cause ofaction the limitations period contained in the federal statute

out of which the cause of action had been judicially created.See Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind, Prupis & Petigrow v. Gilbertson, 501 U. S. 350, 364-366 (1991) (Scalia, J., concurring inpart and concurring in judgment). But the cause of action
at issue here was created not by us, but by Congress. Ac-cordingly, in my view, the appropriate state statute of
limitations governs.Because none of the state statutes arguably applicable
here would frustrate the purposes of the Worker Adjustmentand Retraining Notification Act (WARN), 29 U. S. C. $ 2101
et seq., and because the WARN actions before us are timelyunder even the shortest of those statutes, I concur in the
Court's judgment.

39OCTOBER TERM, 1994
Syllabus

GARLOTTE v. FORDICE, GOVERNOR OFMISSISSIPPI
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fifth circuit

No. 94-6790. Argued April 24, 1995--Decided May 30, 1995
A Mississippi trial court ordered that petitioner Garlotte serve, consecutively, a 3-year prison sentence on a marijuana conviction, followed by
concurrent life sentences on two murder convictions. State law required Garlotte to serve at least 10 months on the first sentence and 10
years on the concurrent sentences. Garlotte unsuccessfully sought
state postconviction collateral relief on the marijuana conviction. By
the time those proceedings ended, he had completed the period of incarceration set for the marijuana offense, and had commenced serving the
life sentences. The Federal District Court denied his subsequent federal habeas petition on the merits, but the Court of Appeals dismissed
the petition for want of jurisdiction. The Court of Appeals adopted the
State's position that Garlotte had already served out the prison time
imposed for the marijuana conviction and, therefore, was no longer "in
custody" under the conviction within the meaning of the federal habeas
statute, 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(a). The court rejected Garlotte's argument
that he remained "in custody" because the marijuana conviction continued to postpone the date on which he would be eligible for parole.

Held: Garlotte was "in custody" under his marijuana conviction when he

filed his federal habeas petition. Pp. 43-47.

(a) In Peyton v. Rowe, 391 U. S. 54, this Court allowed two prisoners
incarcerated under consecutive sentences to apply for federal habeas
relief from sentences they had not yet begun to serve. Viewing consecutive sentences in the aggregate, the Court held that a prisoner serving
consecutive sentences is "in custody" under any one of them for purposes of the habeas statute. A different construction of the statutory
term "in custody" will not be adopted here simply because the sentence
imposed under the challenged conviction lies in the past rather than in
the future. Maleng v. Cook, 490 U. S. 488--in which the Court held
that a habeas petitioner could not challenge a conviction after the sentence imposed for it had fully expired--does not control this case, for
the habeas petitioner in Maleng, unlike Garlotte, was not serving consecutive sentences. Pp. 43-46.

(b) Allowing a habeas attack on a sentence nominally completed is
unlikely to encourage delay in the assertion of habeas challenges. A

Opinion of the Court
prisoner naturally prefers release sooner to release later, and delay is
apt to disadvantage a petitioner--who has the burden of proof--more
than the State. Moreover, under Habeas Corpus Rule 9(a), a district
court may dismiss a habeas petition if the State has been prejudiced
in its ability to respond because of inexcusable delay in the petition's
filing. Pp. 46-47.

Ginsburg, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Stevens,
O'Connor, Scalia, Kennedy, Souter, and Breyer, JJ., joined.
Thomas, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Rehnquist, C. J., joined,

Brian D. Boyle, by appointment of the Court, 513 U. S.1125, argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the

briefs were James R. Asperger and Matthew B. Pachman.

Marvin L. White, Jr., Assistant Attorney General ofMississippi, argued the cause for respondent. With him

on the brief were Mike Moore, Attorney General, and JoAnne M. McLeod and John L. Gadow, Special Assistant
Attorneys General.*

Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court.
To petition a federal court for habeas corpus relief froma state-court conviction, the applicant must be "in custody

in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of theUnited States." 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(a); see also 28 U. S. C.

begun to serve. We said in Peyton that, for purposes ofhabeas relief, consecutive sentences should be treated as a
continuous series; a prisoner is "in custody in violation of the

Opinion of the Court
Constitution," we explained, "if any consecutive sentence[the prisoner is] scheduled to serve was imposed as the result

of a deprivation of constitutional rights." Id., at 64-65.The case before us is appropriately described as Peyton's
complement, or Peyton in reverse. Like the habeas peti-tioners in

Peyton, petitioner Harvey Garlotte is incarceratedunder consecutive sentences. Unlike the Peyton petitioners, however, Garlotte does not challenge a conviction under-lying a sentence yet to be served. Instead, Garlotte seeks
to attack a conviction underlying the sentence that ran firstin a consecutive series, a sentence already served, but one
that nonetheless persists to postpone Garlotte's eligibilityfor parole. Following

Peyton, we do not disaggregate Gar-lotte's sentences, but comprehend them as composing a continuous stream. We therefore hold that Garlotte remains"in custody" under all of his sentences until all are served,
and now may attack the conviction underlying the sentencescheduled to run first in the series.

I
On September 16, 1985, at a plea hearing held in a Missis-sippi trial court, Harvey Garlotte entered simultaneous

guilty pleas to one count of possession with intent to distrib-ute marijuana and two counts of murder. Pursuant to a plea
agreement, the State recommended that Garlotte be sen-tenced to a prison term of three years on the marijuana
count, to run consecutively with two concurrent life sen-tences on the murder counts. App. 43. State law required
Garlotte to serve at least ten months on the marijuana count,Miss. Code Ann. $ 47-7-3(1)(c)(ii) (Supp. 1994), and at least
ten years on the concurrent life sentences. $ 47-7-3(1).At the plea hearing, the trial judge inquired whether the
State wanted Garlotte to serve the life sentences before thethree-year sentence: "[A] three year sentence [on the marijuana possession count] to run consecutive to th[e] two life

Opinion of the Court
sentences?" the judge asked. The prosecutor expressed indifference about the order in which the sentences would run:
"Either that way, your Honor or allow the three years to run
first. In other words, we're just talking about a total of
three years and then life or life and then three years." App.
43. The judge next asked Garlotte's counsel about his understanding of the State's recommendation. Defense counsel replied, without elaboration: "[I]t's my understanding
that the possession case is to run first and then the two life
sentences." Id., at 44. The court saw "no reason not to
go along with the recommendation of the State." Id., at
50. Without further explanation, the court imposed the
sentences in this order: the three-year sentence first, then,
consecutively, the concurrent life sentences. Ibid.

Garlotte wrote to the trial court seven months after the
September 16, 1985 hearing, asking for permission to withdraw his guilty plea on the marijuana count. The court's
reply notified Garlotte of the Mississippi statute under which
he could pursue postconviction collateral relief. Id., at 51.
Garlotte unsuccessfully moved for such relief. Nearly two
years after the denial of Garlotte's motion, the Mississippi
Supreme Court rejected his appeal. Garlotte v. State, 530
So. 2d 693 (1988). On January 18, 1989, the Mississippi Supreme Court denied further postconviction motions filed by
Garlotte. By this time, Garlotte had completed the period
of incarceration set for the marijuana offense, and had commenced serving the life sentences.

On October 6, 1989, Garlotte filed a habeas corpus petition
in the United States District Court for the Southern District
of Mississippi, naming as respondent Kirk Fordice, the Governor of Mississippi.1 Adopting the recommendation of a

1 Garlotte asserted that he was entitled to relief because his guilty plea
was not knowing, intelligent, and voluntary, he did not receive effective
assistance of trial counsel, he was subjected to double jeopardy, and his
sentence was unusual and disproportionate. App. 6.

Opinion of the Court
Federal Magistrate Judge, the District Court denied Gar-lotte's petition on the merits. App. 18.

Before the United States Court of Appeals for the FifthCircuit, the State argued for the first time that the District
Court lacked jurisdiction over Garlotte's petition. 29 F. 3d216, 217 (1994). The State asserted that Garlotte, prior to
the District Court filing, had already served out the prisontime imposed for the marijuana conviction; therefore, the
State maintained, Garlotte was no longer "in custody" underthat conviction within the meaning of the federal habeas
statute. Ibid. Garlotte countered that he remained "incustody" until all sentences were served, emphasizing that
the marijuana conviction continued to postpone the date onwhich he would be eligible for parole. Id., at 218.

Adopting the State's position, the Fifth Circuit dismissedGarlotte's habeas petition for want of jurisdiction. Ibid.
The Courts of Appeals have divided over the questionwhether a person incarcerated under consecutive sentences
remains "in custody" under a sentence that (1) has beencompleted in terms of prison time served, but (2) continues
to postpone the prisoner's date of potential release.2 Wegranted certiorari to resolve this conflict, 513 U. S. 1123
(1995), and now reverse.3 II

The federal habeas statute authorizes United States dis-trict courts to entertain petitions for habeas relief from
state-court judgments only when the petitioner is "in cus-tody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of

2 Compare Fawcett v. Bablitch, 962 F. 2d 617, 618 (CA7 1992) ("in custody"); Bernard v. Garraghty, 934 F. 2d 52, 55 (CA4 1991) (same); and Fox

3 Garlotte, who proceeded pro se in the courts below, filed along with

his petition for certiorari a motion for appointment of counsel. After we
granted certiorari, we appointed Brian D. Boyle, of Washington, D. C., to
represent Garlotte. 513 U. S. 1125 (1995).

the United States." 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(a); see also 28 U. S. C.$ 2241(c)(3). In

Peyton v. Rowe, 391 U. S. 54 (1968), we held
that the statute authorized the exercise of habeas jurisdic-tion over the petitions of two State of Virginia prisoners,

Robert Rowe and Clyde Thacker. Rowe and Thacker were
incarcerated under consecutive sentences; both sought tochallenge sentences slated to run in the future. Virginia,

relying on McNally v. Hill, 293 U. S. 131 (1934), argued thatthe habeas petitions were premature. Overruling

McNally,
we explained:

"[I]n common understanding `custody' comprehends respondents' status for the entire duration of their impris-onment. Practically speaking, Rowe is in custody for

50 years, or for the aggregate of his 30- and 20-yearsentences. For purposes of parole eligibility, under Virginia law he is incarcerated for 50 years. Nothing onthe face of $ 2241 militates against an interpretation
which views Rowe and Thacker as being `in custody'
under the aggregate of the consecutive sentences imposed on them. Under that interpretation, they are `in
custody in violation of the Constitution' if any consecutive sentence they are scheduled to serve was imposed
as the result of a deprivation of constitutional rights."
391 U. S., at 64-65 (citations omitted).

The habeas petitioners in Peyton sought to present challenges that, if successful, would advance their release dates.
That was enough, we concluded, to permit them to invoke
the Great Writ. Id., at 66-67.

Had the Mississippi trial court ordered that Garlotte's life
sentences run before his marijuana sentence--an option
about which the prosecutor expressed indifference--Peyton
unquestionably would have instructed the District Court to
entertain Garlotte's present habeas petition. Because the
marijuana term came first, and Garlotte filed his habeas peti515us1$65P 08-11-98 16:52:08 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
tion (following state-court proceedings) after prison time had
run on the marijuana sentence, Mississippi urges that Maleng v. Cook, 490 U. S. 488 (1989) (per curiam), rather than
Peyton, controls.

The question presented in Maleng was "whether a habeas
petitioner remains `in custody' under a conviction after the
sentence imposed for it has fully expired, merely because of
the possibility that the prior conviction will be used to enhance the sentences imposed for any subsequent crimes of
which he is convicted." 490 U. S., at 492. We held that the
potential use of a conviction to enhance a sentence for subsequent offenses did not suffice to render a person "in custody"
within the meaning of the habeas statute. Ibid.

Maleng recognized that we had "very liberally construed
the `in custody' requirement for purposes of federal habeas,"
but stressed that the Court had "never extended it to the
situation where a habeas petitioner suffers no present restraint from a conviction." Ibid. "[A]lmost all States have
habitual offender statutes, and many States provide . . . for
specific enhancement of subsequent sentences on the basis of
prior convictions," ibid.; hence, the construction of "in custody" urged by the habeas petitioner in Maleng would have
left nearly all convictions perpetually open to collateral attack. The Maleng petitioner's interpretation, we therefore
commented, "would read the `in custody' requirement out of
the statute." Ibid.4

Unlike the habeas petitioner in Maleng, Garlotte is serving consecutive sentences. In Peyton, we held that "a prisoner serving consecutive sentences is `in custody' under any
one of them" for purposes of the habeas statute. 391 U. S.,

4 We left open the possibility, however, that the conviction underlying
the expired sentence might be subject to challenge in a collateral attack
upon the subsequent sentence that the expired sentence was used to enhance. Maleng, 490 U. S., at 494.

Having construed the statutory term "in custody" torequire that consecutive sentences be viewed in the aggregate, we will not now adopt a different construction simplybecause the sentence imposed under the challenged conviction lies in the past rather than in the future.5Mississippi urges, as a prime reason for its construction of
the "in custody" requirement, that allowing a habeas attack
on a sentence nominally completed would "encourage andreward delay in the assertion of habeas challenges." Brief

McNally in part because
of "the harshness of a rule which may delay determinationof federal claims for decades."

Mississippi argues that Garlotte's reading of the words "incustody" would undermine the expeditious adjudication

rationale of Peyton. Brief for Respondent 6-7, 27-28.

Our holding today, however, is unlikely to encourage delay.
A prisoner naturally prefers release sooner to release later.
Further, because the habeas petitioner generally bears the
burden of proof, delay is apt to disadvantage the petitioner
more than the State. Nothing in this record, we note, suggests that Garlotte has been dilatory in challenging his marijuana conviction. Finally, under Habeas Corpus Rule 9(a),
a district court may dismiss a habeas petition if the State

5 That Mississippi itself views consecutive sentences in the aggregate for
various penological purposes reveals the difficulties courts and prisoners
would face trying to determine when one sentence ends and a consecutive
sentence begins. For example, Mississippi aggregates consecutive sentences for the purpose of determining parole eligibility, see Miss. Code
Ann. $ 47-7-3(1) (Supp. 1994) ("Every prisoner . . . who has served not less
than one-fourth (1/4) of the total of such term or terms for which such
prisoner was sentenced . . . may be released on parole as hereinafter provided . . . .") (emphasis added), and for the purpose of determining commutation of sentences for meritorious earned-time credit. See Miss. Code
Ann. $ 47-5-139(3) (1981) ("An offender under two (2) or more consecutive
sentences shall be allowed commutation based upon the total term of the
sentences.") (emphasis added).

"has been prejudiced in its ability to respond to the petitionby [inexcusable] delay in its filing."

Under Peyton, we view consecutive sentences in the ag-gregate, not as discrete segments. Invalidation of Garlotte's marijuana conviction would advance the date of hiseligibility for release from present incarceration. Garlotte's
challenge, which will shorten his term of incarceration if heproves unconstitutionality, implicates the core purpose of
habeas review. We therefore hold that Garlotte was "incustody" under his marijuana conviction when he filed his
federal habeas petition. Accordingly, the judgment ofthe Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit is reversed, and
the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with thisopinion.

It is so ordered.
Justice Thomas, with whom The Chief Justice joins,dissenting.

The Court concludes that a habeas petitioner may assertthat he "is in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws
or treaties of the United States," 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(a), evenwhen the petitioner admits that the conviction he wishes to
challenge has expired. Because this construction of the ha-beas statute is neither required by our case law nor, more
importantly, by the statute, I dissent.In holding that Garlotte was in custody for his expired
marijuana conviction, the Court relies heavily on Peyton v.
Rowe, 391 U. S. 54 (1968). There, petitioners wished to chal-lenge sentences that they had not yet begun to serve, claiming that they were nevertheless "in custody" under thesesentences. Overruling

McNally v. Hill, 293 U. S. 131 (1934),we held that such challenges could proceed. Practical considerations drove us to adopt a rule permitting early chal-lenges to convictions. Allowing challenges to sentences that

62-63. Recognizing that the first reason for finding thepetitioners in Peyton "in custody" is not present here (and
indeed may cut against the majority's conclusion), the Courtrelies on the second ground, namely, that a prisoner serving
time under consecutive sentences "is `in custody' under anyone of them" for purposes of $ 2241(c)(3).

In my view, Peyton ought to be construed as limited tosituations in which a habeas petitioner challenges a yet unexpired sentence. This would satisfy Peyton's policy concernsby permitting challenges to unserved sentences at an earlier time. More importantly, this interpretation would alsomake sense of the Court's proper insistence in Maleng v.
Cook, 490 U. S. 488 (1989), that the habeas statute does notpermit prisoners to challenge expired convictions. See

id.,at 490-491 ("We have interpreted the statutory language as

requiring that the habeas petitioner be `in custody' under theconviction or sentence under attack at the time his petition
is filed"). The majority, however, relies upon broad lan-guage in one opinion to ignore language in another.

determine when one sentence ends and a consecutive sentence begins."

Those difficulties should not lead us to conclude that petitioner was "in

"hold[ing]." 391 U. S., at 67. Other language in the opinion suggests a

the result of a deprivation of constitutional rights") (emphasis added).

RENO, ATTORNEY GENERAL, et al. v. KORAY
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe third circuit

No. 94-790. Argued April 24, 1995--Decided June 5, 1995
Under 18 U. S. C. $ 3585(b), a defendant generally must "be given credit

toward the service of a term of imprisonment for any time he has spent
in official detention prior to the date the sentence commences." Before
respondent's federal sentence commenced, he was "released" on bail pursuant to the Bail Reform Act of 1984 and ordered confined to a community treatment center. After his prison sentence began, the Bureau of
Prisons (BOP) relied on its established policy in refusing to credit toward his sentence the time he had spent at the treatment center. He
exhausted his administrative remedies and then filed a federal habeas
corpus petition. A District Court denied his petition on the ground
that his stay at the center was not "official detention" under $ 3585(b).
In reversing, the Court of Appeals declined to defer to BOP's view that
time spent under highly restrictive conditions while "released" on bail
is not "official detention" because a "released" defendant is not subject
to BOP's control. It reasoned instead that "official detention" includes
time spent under conditions of "jail-type confinement."

Held: The time respondent spent at the treatment center while "released"

on bail was not "official detention" within the meaning of $ 3585(b).
Pp. 55-65.

(a) Viewed in isolation, the phrase "official detention" could either
refer, as the Government contends, to a court order detaining a defendant and committing him to the custody of the Attorney General for confinement, or, as respondent argues, to the restrictive conditions of his
release on bail under an "official" order that significantly curtailed his
liberty. Examination of the phrase in light of the context in which it is
used, however, reveals that the Government's interpretation is correct.
P. 56.

(b) The "official detention" language must be construed in conjunction
with the Bail Reform Act of 1984, since $ 3585(b) provides credit only
for presentence restraints on liberty and since it is the Bail Reform Act
that authorizes federal courts to place such restraints on a defendant's
liberty. That Act provides a court with only two choices: It may either
"release" a defendant on bail, 18 U. S. C. $ 3142(c), or order him "detained" without bail, $ 3142(e). A defendant suffers "detention" only
when committed to the Attorney General's custody, $ 3142(i)(2); a de515us1$66Z 08-13-98 12:45:01 PAGES OPINPGT

Syllabus
fendant admitted to bail, even on restrictive conditions, as respondent
was, see $ 3142(c), is "released." Pp. 56-58.

(c) Section 3585(a) and related sentencing provisions confirm the view
that $ 3585(b) is available only to those defendants who were detained
in a penal or correctional facility and subject to BOP's control. The
context and history of $ 3585(b) also support this reading. The provision reduces a defendant's "imprisonment" by the amount of time spent
in "official detention" before his sentence, strongly suggesting that the
presentence "detention" period must be equivalent to the "imprisonment" itself. And nothing suggests that when Congress replaced $ 3568
with $ 3585(b), it substituted the phrase "official detention" for "in custody" because it disagreed with the Courts of Appeals' uniform rule that

$ 3568 denied credit to defendants released on bail. To the contrary,
Congress presumably made the change to conform the credit statute to
the nomenclature used in related sentencing provisions and in the Bail
Reform Act of 1984. Pp. 58-60.

(d) In an internal guideline, BOP likewise has interpreted the phrase
"official detention" to require credit only for a defendant's time spent
under a $ 3142 "detention order." This is the most natural reading of
the phrase, and the internal guideline of the agency charged with administering the credit statute is entitled to some deference where it is a
permissible construction of the statute. Pp. 60-61.

(e) In contrast, respondent's reading of "official detention" is plausible
only if the phrase is read in isolation. But even then, it is not the only
plausible interpretation. Respondent correctly notes that a defendant
"released" to a treatment center could be subject to restraints that do
not materially differ from those imposed on a "detained" defendant who
is assigned to a treatment center as part of his sentence. However, that
fact does not undercut the important distinction between all defendants
"detained" and all defendants "released" on bail: The former always
remain completely subject to BOP's control. The Court of Appeals' alternative construction would require a fact-intensive inquiry into the
circumstances of confinement in each case to determine whether a defendant "released" on bail was subjected to "jail-type confinement." On
the other hand, the Government's construction provides both it and a
defendant with clear notice of the consequences of a "release" or "detention" order. Finally, the rule of lenity does not apply here. A statute
is not "ambiguous" for purposes of the rule merely because there is a
division of judicial authority over its proper construction. Rather, the
rule applies only if, after seizing everything from which aid can be derived, this Court can make no more than a guess as to what Congress
intended. That is not this case. Pp. 61-65.
21 F. 3d 558, reversed and remanded.

Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of theCourt.
Title 18 U. S. C. $ 3585(b) provides that a defendant gener-ally must "be given credit toward the service of a term of
imprisonment for any time he has spent in official detentionprior to the date the sentence commences." Before the
commencement of respondent's federal sentence, a FederalMagistrate Judge "released" him on bail pursuant to the Bail
Reform Act of 1984 and ordered him confined to a communitytreatment center. The question presented is whether respondent was in "official detention," and thus entitled to asentence credit under $ 3585(b), during the time he spent at
the treatment center. We hold that he was not.On April 23, 1991, respondent Ziya Koray was arrested for
laundering monetary instruments in violation of 18 U. S. C.$ 1956(a)(1). On June 18, 1991, he pleaded guilty to that
charge in the United States District Court for the Districtof Maryland. One week later, on June 25, 1991, a Federal
Magistrate Judge entered a "release order" pursuant to 18U. S. C. $ 3142(c), ordering respondent released on bail, pending sentencing, into the custody of the Pretrial Services

Agency. The order required that he be "confined to [the]premises" of a Volunteers of America community treatment

center without "authoriz[ation] to leave for any reason unlessaccompanied" by a Government special agent. On October
22, 1991, the District Court sentenced respondent to 41
months' imprisonment. Respondent remained at the Volun-teers of America facility until November 25, 1991, the day he

reported to the Allenwood Federal Prison Camp to servehis sentence.

Respondent requested the Bureau of Prisons (BOP or Bu-reau) to credit toward his sentence of imprisonment the approximately 150 days he spent at the Volunteers of America
community treatment center between June 25 and November
25, 1991. Relying on its established policy, BOP refused to
grant the requested credit. After exhausting his administrative remedies, respondent filed a petition for habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania seeking credit under 18 U. S. C. $ 3585
for the time he spent at the community treatment center.
The District Court denied the petition, finding that respondent's stay at the center did not constitute "official detention"
within the meaning of 18 U. S. C. $ 3585(b).

The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed. 21
F. 3d 558 (1994). It acknowledged that the overwhelming
majority of the Courts of Appeals "have concluded that section 3585 . . . does not require the Bureau to credit presentenced defendants whose bail conditions allowed them to
be confined outside of Bureau of Prison[s] facilities." Id., at
561. The court declined, however, to defer to the Bureau's
view--that time spent under highly restrictive conditions
while "released" on bail is not " `official detention' " under

$ 3585(b) because a " `released' " defendant is not subject to
the Bureau's control. Id., at 562-565. Instead, the court
reasoned that $ 3585(b)'s " `official detention' " language need
not be read "as if it provided `official detention by the Attorney General or the Bureau of Prisons,' " since "there is noth515us1$66H 08-13-98 12:45:01 PAGES OPINPGT

ing in the statute which requires or suggests that a defendant must be under the detention of the Bureau," and since
"[a] court may `detain' a person as `official[ly]' as the Attorney General." Id., at 563-564. Concluding that " `official
detention' for purposes of credit under 18 U. S. C. $ 3585 includes time spent under conditions of jail-type confinement,"
id., at 567, the Court of Appeals remanded the case for a
determination whether respondent was in "jail-type confinement" during his stay at the Volunteers of America community treatment center.

We granted the Government's petition for certiorari to resolve a conflict among the Courts of Appeals on the question
whether a federal prisoner is entitled to credit against his
sentence under $ 3585(b) for time when he was "released" on
bail pursuant to the Bail Reform Act of 1984.1 513 U. S.
1106 (1995). We now reverse.

Opinion of the Court
Title 18 U. S. C. $ 3585 determines when a federal sentenceof imprisonment commences and whether credit against that

sentence must be granted for time spent in "official deten-tion" before the sentence began. It states:

"Calculation of a term of imprisonment"(a)

Commencement of Sentence.--A sentence toa term of imprisonment commences on the date the defendant is received in custody awaiting transportationto, or arrives voluntarily to commence service of sentence at, the official detention facility at which the sen-tence is to be served.

"(b) Credit for Prior Custody.--A defendant shallbe given credit toward the service of a term of imprisonment for any time he has spent in official detentionprior to the date the sentence commences--

"(1) as a result of the offense for which the sentencewas imposed; or
"(2) as a result of any other charge for which the de-fendant was arrested after the commission of the offense
for which the sentence was imposed;
"that has not been credited against another sentence."18 U. S. C. $ 3585 (emphasis added).

In United States v. Wilson, 503 U. S. 329, 337 (1992), we spe-cifically noted Congress' use of the term " `official detention' "
in $ 3585(b), but we had no occasion to rule on the meaningof that term. We must do so today.

2 Our task is strictly one of statutory interpretation. Respondent argued in the District Court that $ 3585 violated equal protection principles
by treating pretrial defendants differently than postsentenced defendants.

a similar equal protection argument, see Brief for USC Law Center's

Opinion of the Court
The Government contends that the phrase "official detention" in $ 3585(b) refers to a court order detaining a defendant and committing him to the custody of the Attorney
General for confinement. Respondent, on the other hand,
argues that the phrase "official detention" includes the restrictive conditions of his release on bail because the Federal
Magistrate's bail order was "official" and significantly curtailed his liberty. Viewing the phrase in isolation, it may be
said that either reading is plausible. But it is a "fundamental principle of statutory construction (and, indeed, of language itself) that the meaning of a word cannot be determined in isolation, but must be drawn from the context in
which it is used." Deal v. United States, 508 U. S. 129, 132
(1993). After examining the phrase "official detention" in
this light, we believe the Government's interpretation is the
correct one.

Section 3585(b) provides credit for time "spent in official
detention prior to the date the sentence commences," 18
U. S. C. $ 3585(b) (emphasis added), thus making clear that
credit is awarded only for presentence restraints on liberty.
Because the Bail Reform Act of 1984, 18 U. S. C. $ 3141 et
seq., is the body of law that authorizes federal courts to place
presentence restraints on a defendant's liberty, see $ 3142(a)
(authorizing courts to impose restraints on the defendant
"pending trial"); $ 3143(a) (authorizing courts to impose
restraints while the defendant "is waiting imposition or
execution of sentence"), the "official detention" language of

$ 3585(b) must be construed in conjunction with that Act.
This is especially so because the Bail Reform Act of 1984 was
enacted in the same statute as the Sentencing Reform Act of

ment is not properly before the Court. See United Parcel Service, Inc.
v. Mitchell, 451 U. S. 56, 60, n. 2 (1981) (noting that this Court does not
decide issues raised by amici that were not decided by the court of appeals
or argued by the interested party); Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U. S. 520, 531, n. 13
(1979) (same).

1984, of which $ 3585 is a part.3 See Gozlon-Peretz v. UnitedStates, 498 U. S. 395, 407-408 (1991) ("It is not uncommon to

refer to other, related legislative enactments when interpret-ing specialized statutory terms," since Congress is presumed
to have "legislated with reference to" those terms).The Bail Reform Act of 1984 provides a federal court with
two choices when dealing with a criminal defendant who hasbeen "charged with an offense" and is awaiting trial, 18
U. S. C. $ 3142(a), or who "has been found guilty of an offenseand . . . is awaiting imposition or execution of sentence,"
18 U. S. C. $ 3143(a)(1) (1988 ed., Supp. V). The court may
either (1) "release" the defendant on bail or (2) order him
"detained" without bail. A court may "release" a defendantsubject to a variety of restrictive conditions, including

residence in a community treatment center. See $$ 3142(c)(1)(B)(i), (x), and (xiv). If, however, the court "finds that no
condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assurethe appearance of the person as required and the safety of
any other person and the community," $ 3142(e), the court"shall order the detention of the person,"

ibid., by issuing a
"detention order" "direct[ing] that the person be committed
to the custody of the Attorney General for confinement in acorrections facility," $ 3142(i)(2). Thus, under the language

of the Bail Reform Act of 1984, a defendant suffers "deten-tion" only when committed to the custody of the Attorney
General; a defendant admitted to bail on restrictive con-ditions, as respondent was, is "released." See

Opinion of the Court
(Loken, J., concurring); United States v. Becak, 954 F. 2d 386,388 (CA6), cert. denied, 504 U. S. 945 (1992).

Section 3585(a) and related sentencing provisions confirmthis interpretation. Section 3585(a) provides that a federal
sentence "commences" when the defendant is received for
transportation to or arrives at "the official detention facilityat which the sentence is to be served." Title 18 U. S. C.

$ 3621, in turn, provides that the sentenced defendant "shallbe committed to the custody of the Bureau of Prisons,"

$ 3621(a), which "may designate any available penal or correctional facility . . . , whether maintained by the Federal
Government or otherwise . . . , that the Bureau determines
to be appropriate and suitable," $ 3621(b) (emphasis added).
The phrase "official detention facility" in $ 3585(a) therefore
must refer to a correctional facility designated by the Bureau
for the service of federal sentences, where the Bureau retains the discretion to "direct the transfer of a prisoner from
one penal or correctional facility to another." $ 3621(b).

This reading of $ 3585(a) is reinforced by other provisions
governing the administration of federal sentences. For example, $ 3622 gives the Bureau authority to release a prisoner from the place of his imprisonment for a limited period
to "participate in a training or educational program in the
community while continuing in official detention at the
prison facility," $ 3622(b), or to "work at paid employment in
the community while continuing in official detention at the
penal or correctional facility," $ 3622(c). Because the words
"official detention" should bear the same meaning in subsections (a) and (b) of $ 3585 as they do in the above related
sentencing statutes, see Estate of Cowart v. Nicklos Drilling Co., 505 U. S. 469, 479 (1992) ("[T]he basic canon of statutory construction [is] that identical terms within an Act bear
the same meaning"), credit for time spent in "official detention" under $ 3585(b) is available only to those defendants
who were detained in a "penal or correctional facility,"

$ 3621(b), and who were subject to BOP's control.

The context and history of $ 3585(b) also support this view.As for context, $ 3585(b) reduces a defendant's "imprisonment" by the amount of time spent in "official detention"before his sentence, strongly suggesting that the period of
presentence "detention" must be equivalent to the "imprisonment" itself. It would be anomalous to interpret $ 3585(b)to require sentence credit for time spent confined in a community treatment center where the defendant is not subjectto BOP's control, since Congress generally views such a restriction on liberty as part of a sentence of "probation," see18 U. S. C. $$ 3563(b)(10), (12), and (14), or "supervised release," see $ 3583(d), rather than part of a sentence of "imprisonment." See United States v. Zackular, 945 F. 2d 423,
425 (CA1 1991).

With respect to history, $ 3585(b)'s predecessor, 18 U. S. C.

$ 3568 (1982 ed.) (repealed), required the Attorney General
to award sentence credit for "any days spent in custody

in connection with the offense or acts for which sentence
was imposed." (Emphasis added.) The Courts of Appeals
uniformly held that the phrase "in custody" did not allow
sentence credit because of restrictions placed on a defendant's liberty as a condition of release on bail. See
Polakoff v. United States, 489 F. 2d 727, 730 (CA5
1974) (time spent on "highly restricted bond" not creditable as " `custody' "); United States v. Robles, 563 F. 2d
1308, 1309 (CA9 1977) ("[T]ime spent on bail or on bond pending appeal is not time served `in custody' "), cert. denied,
435 U. S. 925 (1978); Ortega v. United States, 510 F. 2d 412,
413 (CA10 1975) (" `custody' " refers to "actual custodial
incarceration," not "the time a criminal defendant is free

(CADC 1974) (" `in custody' " does "not refer to the stipulations imposed when a defendant is at large on conditional
release"). In 1984, Congress enacted $ 3585(b) and altered

$ 3568 by, inter alia, "replac[ing] the term `custody' with the
term `official detention.' " Wilson, 503 U. S., at 337; see also

18 U. S. C. $ 3585(b). In thus rewording the credit statute,however, nothing suggests that Congress disagreed with the

Courts of Appeals' rule denying credit to defendants whohad been released on bail. To the contrary, Congress presumably made the change to conform the credit statute tothe nomenclature used in related sentencing provisions, see
18 U. S. C. $$ 3585(a) and 3622, and in the Bail Reform Actof 1984. See

Moreland, 968 F. 2d, at 662, and n. 5 (Loken,J., concurring).

The Bureau, as the agency charged with administeringthe credit statute, see Wilson, supra, at 334-335, likewise has interpreted $ 3585(b)'s "official detention" languageto require credit for time spent by a defendant under a

$ 3142(e) "detention order," but not for time spent under a$ 3142(c) "release order," no matter how restrictive the
conditions.4 As we have explained, see supra, at 56-60, the

Bureau of Prisons Program Statement No. 5880.28(c) (July 29, 1994), which
reads as follows:

"Prior Custody Time Credit. The [Sentencing Reform Act] includes a
new statutory provision, 18 U. S. C. $ 3585(b), that pertains to `credit for
prior custody' and is controlling for making time credit determinations

"Official detention. `Official detention' is defined, for purposes of this
policy, as time spent under a federal detention order. This also includes
time spent under a detention order when the court has recommended
placement in a less secure environment or in a community based program
as a condition of presentence detention. A person under these circumstances remains in `official detention,' subject to the discretion of the Attorney General and the U. S. Marshals Service with respect to the place
of detention. Those defendants placed in a program and/or residence as
a condition of detention are subject to removal and return to a more secure
environment at the discretion of the Attorney General and the U. S. Marshals Service, and further, remain subject to prosecution for escape from
detention for any unauthorized absence from the program/residence.

Opinion of the Court
Bureau's interpretation is the most natural and reasonablereading of $ 3585(b)'s "official detention" language. It is true

that the Bureau's interpretation appears only in a "ProgramStatemen[t]"--an internal agency guideline--rather than in
"published regulations subject to the rigors of the Administrative Procedur[e] Act, including public notice and com-ment." 21 F. 3d, at 562. But BOP's internal agency guideline, which is akin to an "interpretive rule" that "do[es] notrequire notice and comment,"

Shalala v. Guernsey Memorial Hospital, 514 U. S. 87, 99 (1995), is still entitled to somedeference, cf.

Martin v. Occupational Safety and Health Review Comm'n, 499 U. S. 144, 157 (1991), since it is a "permis-sible construction of the statute,"

Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v.
Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 843
(1984).Respondent, as we have indicated, disagrees with the

above interpretation of $ 3585(b). He contends that the
"plain meaning" of the phrase "official detention" includes
the restrictive conditions of his confinement, even though he

from detention with a requirement of program participation and/or
residence.

"A defendant is not eligible for any credits while released from detention. Time spent in residence in a community corrections center as a
result of the Pretrial Services Act of 1982 (18 U. S. C. $ 3152-3154), or as
a result of a condition of bail or bond (18 U. S. C. $ 3141-3143), is not creditable as presentence time. A condition of bail or bond which is `highly
restrictive,' and that includes `house arrest', `electronic monitoring' or
`home confinement'; or such as requiring the defendant to report daily to
the U. S. Marshal, U. S. Probation Service, or other person; is not considered as time in official detention. Such a defendant is not subject to the
discretion of the U. S. Attorney General, the Bureau of Prisons, or the
U. S. Marshals Service, regarding participation, placement, or subsequent
return to a more secure environment, and therefore is not in a status
which would indicate an award of credit is appropriate (see Randall v.
Whelan, 938 F. 2d 522 (4th Cir. 1991) and U. S. v. Insley, 927 F. 2d 185 (4th
Cir. 1991). Further, the government may not prosecute for escape in the
case of an unauthorized absence in such cases, as the person has been
lawfully released from `official detention.' " (Emphasis in original.)

Opinion of the Court
was released on bail. This contention is a plausible one if
the phrase is read in isolation: respondent was subjected to
restrictive conditions when released on bail, these conditions
were imposed by a court order, and his sojourn in the community treatment center therefore amounted to "official detention." But even without reference to the context of the
language and the history of the statute, respondent's is not
the only plausible interpretation of the language; it would be
too much to say that the statute "cannot bear the interpretation adopted by" the Bureau. Sullivan v. Everhart, 494
U. S. 83, 91-92 (1990). And in light of the foregoing textual
and historical analysis, the initial plausibility of respondent's
reading simply does not carry the day.

Respondent also argues it is improper to focus on the
release/detention dichotomy of the Bail Reform Act of 1984
to construe $ 3585(b)'s "official detention" language because
a defendant "released" on bail may be subjected to conditions
(under 18 U. S. C. $ 3142(c)(1)(B)(xiv)) that are just as onerous
as those faced by "detained" defendants. In addition, he asserts that his confinement as a "released" defendant in the
Volunteers of America community treatment center constituted "official detention" because "sentenced" prisoners are
deemed to be in "official detention" when BOP authorizes
them to serve the last part of their sentences in a community
treatment center, see U. S. Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Prisons Program Statement No. 7310.02 (Oct. 19, 1993) (interpreting 18 U. S. C. $ 3624(c) to allow BOP to place sentenced
prisoners in community corrections centers, since such centers meet 18 U. S. C. $ 3621(b)'s definition of a "penal or correctional facility"), or to serve their sentences on educational
or work release, see 18 U. S. C. $$ 3622(b) and (c).

It is quite true that under the Government's theory a defendant "released" to a community treatment center could be
subject to restraints which do not materially differ from
those imposed on a "detained" defendant committed to the

Opinion of the Court
custody of the Attorney General, and thence assigned to atreatment center. But this fact does not undercut the remaining distinction that exists between all defendants com-mitted to the custody of the Attorney General on the one
hand, and all defendants released on bail on the other. Un-like defendants "released" on bail, defendants who are "detained" or "sentenced" always remain subject to the control
of the Bureau. See Randall v. Whelan, 938 F. 2d 522, 525(CA4 1991). This is an important distinction, as the identity

of the custodian has both legal and practical significance. Adefendant who is "released" is not in BOP's custody, and he
cannot be summarily reassigned to a different place of con-finement unless a judicial officer revokes his release, see 18
U. S. C. $ 3148(b), or modifies the conditions of his release,see $ 3142(c)(3). A defendant who is "detained," however, is
completely subject to BOP's control. And "[t]hat single fac-tor encompasses a wide variety of restrictions."

Randall,supra, at 525. "Detained" defendants are subject to BOP's

disciplinary procedures; they are subject to summary reas-signment to any other penal or correctional facility within
the system, cf. Meachum v. Fano, 427 U. S. 215, 224-229(1976); and, being in the legal custody of BOP, the Bureau
has full discretion to control many conditions of their con-finement. See

Moody v. Daggett, 429 U. S. 78, 88, n. 9 (1976);Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U. S. 520, 544-548 (1979).

5 In some cases, a defendant will be arrested, denied bail, and held in
custody pursuant to state law, being turned over later to the Federal Government for prosecution. In these situations, BOP often grants credit
under $ 3585(b) for time spent in state custody, see, e. g., U. S. Dept. of
Justice, Federal Bureau of Prisons, Operations Memorandum (Oct. 23,
1989); U. S. Dept. of Justice, Federal Bureau of Prisons, Sentence Computation Manual CCCA (1992 and Supp. 1994), even though the defendant
was not subject to the control of BOP. These situations obviously are
not governed by reference to a $ 3142 "release" or "detention" order. But
because the only question before us is whether a defendant is in "official
detention" under $ 3585(b) during the time he is "released" on bail pursu515us1$66H 08-13-98 12:45:01 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
It may seem unwise policy to treat defendants differentlyfor purposes of sentence credit under $ 3585(b) when they are

similarly situated in fact--the one is confined to a communitytreatment center after having been "detained" and committed to the Bureau's custody, while the other is "released"
to such a center on bail. But the alternative construction
adopted by the Court of Appeals in this case has its own
grave difficulties. To determine in each case whether a defendant "released" on bail was subjected to "jail-type confinement" would require a fact-intensive inquiry into the circumstances of confinement, an inquiry based on information
in the hands of private entities not available to the Bureau as
a matter of right. Even were such information more readily
available, it seems certain that the phrase "jail-type confinement" would remain sufficiently vague and amorphous so
that much the same kind of disparity in treatment for similarly situated defendants would arise. The Government's
construction of $ 3585(b), on the other hand, provides both it
and the defendant with clear notice of the consequences of a

$ 3142 "release" or "detention" order.

Respondent finally suggests that the rule of lenity requires
adoption of the "jail-type confinement" test for purposes of
calculating credit under $ 3585(b) because "there is a split
of authority in the Circuits concerning the reach of `official
detention,' " Brief for Respondent 34, n. 13, and because
there is ambiguity as to which forms of custody fall within
the meaning of " `official detention.' " See id., at 34. Respondent misconstrues the doctrine. A statute is not " `amant to the Bail Reform Act of 1984, we need not and do not rule here on
the propriety of BOP's decision to grant credit under $ 3585(b) to a defendant who is denied bail pursuant to state law and held in the custody of
state authorities. Thus, the dissent is simply wrong when it states that
we have "adopt[ed] an interpretation that the Bureau of Prisons itself has
rejected" by not allowing any " `credit for time spent in state custody.' "

biguous' for purposes of lenity merely because" there is "adivision of judicial authority" over its proper construction.

Moskal v. United States, 498 U. S. 103, 108 (1990). The ruleof lenity applies only if, "after seizing everything from which
aid can be derived," Smith v. United States, 508 U. S. 223,
239 (1993) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted),
we can make "no more than a guess as to what Congress
intended." Ladner v. United States, 358 U. S. 169, 178
(1958). That is not this case.

We hold that the time respondent spent at the Volunteers
of America community treatment center while "released" on
bail pursuant to the Bail Reform Act of 1984 was not "official
detention" within the meaning of 18 U. S. C. $ 3585(b). Respondent therefore was not entitled to a credit against his
sentence of imprisonment. The judgment of the Court of
Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further
proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Justice Ginsburg, concurring.
As the Government reads 18 U. S. C. $ 3585(b), Koray gains
credit against his sentence for the two months he spent in
jail, but not for the five months' close confinement he encountered at the halfway house. The Court cogently explains
why it adopts the Government's interpretation. I write separately to point out that Koray has not argued before us that
he did not elect bail intelligently, i. e., with comprehension
that time in the halfway house, unlike time in jail, would
yield no credit against his eventual sentence. The Court
thus does not foreclose the possibility that the fundamental
fairness we describe as "due process" calls for notice and a
comprehension check. Cf. Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 11 (setting
out information a court is to convey to assure that a defendant who pleads guilty understands the consequences of the
plea).

66 RENO v. KORAY

Stevens, J., dissenting
Justice Stevens, dissenting.
Pursuant to an order entered by a federal judicial officer,
respondent was "confined to premises of [Volunteers ofAmerica (VOA)]," a private halfway house. The order of

confinement--euphemistically styled a "release" order--pro-vided that respondent "shall not be authorized to leave for
any reason unless accompanied by Special Agent DennisBass." Brief for Respondent 3. While at VOA, respondent
"had to account for his presence five times a day, he was
subject to random breath and urine tests, his access to visi-tors was limited in both time and manner, and there was

a paucity of vocational, educational, and recreational serv-ices compared to a prison facility."

Koray v. Sizer, 21 F. 3d
558, 566 (CA3 1994). Except for one off-site medical exam,respondent remained at VOA 24 hours a day for 150 days.

In my opinion, respondent's confinement was unquestion-ably both "official" and "detention" within the meaning of 18
U. S. C. $ 3585(b).

Both the text and the purpose of $ 3585(b) clearly contemplate that a person who is locked up for 24 hours a day, seven
days a week, pursuant to a court order, is in "official detention." Such a person is surely in custody, and that custody
is no less "official" for being ordered by a court rather than
the Attorney General. Indeed, even the majority acknowledges the force of this plain meaning argument. Ante, at
61-62.* Moreover, the manifest purpose of $ 3585(b) is to
give a convicted person credit for all time spent in official

custody as a result of the offense that gave rise to his convic-tion. When that confinement is in a facility that has all the

restraints of a typical prison, it should not matter whetherthat facility is operated by a State, a county, or a private
custodian pursuant to a contract with the Government.

Purporting to establish the contrary conclusion, the Courtlabors to prove the rather obvious proposition that all persons in the custody of the Attorney General pursuant to adetention order issued under 18 U. S. C. $ 3142 (1988 ed. and
Supp. V), as well as all persons confined in an "official deten-tion facility" under $ 3585(a), are also in "official detention"
within the meaning of $ 3585(b). However, proof that confinement under $ 3142 or $ 3585(a) constitutes official detention certainly is not proof that no other form of confinement
can constitute official detention. The majority thus fails to
demonstrate that respondent should not receive sentencing
credit for his court-ordered full-time confinement in a jailtype facility.

Moreover, the Court's restrictive interpretation creates
an anomalous result. Under the Court's view that only a
person "committed to the custody of the Attorney General"
can be in "official detention," $ 3585(b) does not authorize any
credit for time spent in state custody, "no matter how restrictive the conditions." Ante, at 60, 63-64, n. 5. This
conclusion is so plainly at war with common sense that even
the Attorney General rejects it. See Brief for Petitioners
11 ("[T]he Bureau grants credit for time spent in state custody"); see also Reply Brief for Petitioners 7-8.

The majority attempts to escape its self-created anomaly
by suggesting that it "need not and do[es] not rule" on the
propriety of giving credit for confinement under state law.
Ante, at 64, n. 5. But that contention simply collapses the
majority's house of cards. For either the "text" of the Bail
Reform Act limits "official detention" to custody of the Attorney General, in which case the majority adopts an interpretation that even the Attorney General rejects, or the

68 RENO v. KORAY

Stevens, J., dissenting
"text" does not limit the meaning of official detention, andthen there is absolutely no reason for concluding that courtordered 24-hour-a-day confinement is not official detention.The majority cannot have it both ways.

Given the anomalous implications of the Court's decision,
one may fairly question how the majority justifies its result.It is surely not the plain language of the statute, because

the majority's reading requires that a judicially mandated,24-hour-a-day confinement in a jail-type facility is neither
"official" (because it is ordered by a judge and not the Attor-ney General) nor "detention" (because the judicial order is
labeled "release"). Nor does the majority rely on the nature
of the facility itself, because the majority concedes that if the
Attorney General rather than the court had confined respondent in the exact same facility, respondent's confinement
would have been "official detention" under the statute. The
majority purports to rely on some sort of Chevron deference,
ante, at 61, but it is indeed an odd sort of deference given
that (as I have noted above) the majority adopts an interpretation that the Bureau of Prisons itself has rejected.

The majority suggests at one point that it relies on the
history of the interpretation of the word "custody," arguing
that Congress did not intend to change the settled meaning
of "custody" that existed prior to the Bail Reform Act.
However, not one of the cases cited by the majority, ante, at
59, stands for the proposition that custody does not include
confinement in a jail-type facility. Instead, all of those cases
involved situations in which the defendant was at large.
See Polakoff v. United States, 489 F. 2d 727, 730 (CA5 1974)

required to report weekly to a probation officer"); United
States v. Robles, 563 F. 2d 1308, 1309 (CA9 1977) (defendant
required to "obey all laws, remain within the jurisdiction unless court permission was granted to travel, obey all court
orders, and keep his attorney posted as to his address and
employment"); Ortega v. United States, 510 F. 2d 412, 413

(CA10 1975) ("released on personal recognizance"); UnitedStates v. Peterson, 507 F. 2d 1191, 1192 (CADC 1974) (defendant "at large on conditional release"). Moreover, at leastone Court of Appeals (albeit after the passage of the Bail
Reform Act) interpreted the word "custody" under $ 3568as including "enforced residence under conditions approaching those of incarceration." Brown v. Rison, 895 F. 2d 533,536 (CA9 1990). Thus, though I agree with the majority
that Congress intended to incorporate the understanding of"custody" that existed under $ 3568, I fail to see how that
intention supports the majority's result.Simply accepting the plain meaning of the statutory text
would avoid the anomalies created by the Court's opinion,would effectuate the intent of Congress, and would provide
fair treatment for defendants who will otherwise spend moretime in custody than Congress has deemed necessary or appropriate. For these reasons, I agree with the persua-sive opinion of the Court of Appeals and would affirm its
judgment.

MISSOURI et al. v. JENKINS et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eighth circuit

No. 93-1823. Argued January 11, 1995--Decided June 12, 1995*
In this 18-year-old school desegregation litigation, see, e. g., Missouri v.

Jenkins, 495 U. S. 33, Missouri challenges the District Court's orders
requiring the State (1) to fund salary increases for virtually all instructional and noninstructional staff within the Kansas City, Missouri,
School District (KCMSD), and (2) to continue to fund remedial "quality
education" programs because student achievement levels were still "at
or below national norms at many grade levels." In affirming the orders, the Court of Appeals rejected the State's argument that the salary
increases exceeded the District Court's remedial authority because they
did not directly address and relate to the State's constitutional violation:
its operation, prior to 1954, of a segregated school system within the
KCMSD. The Court of Appeals observed, inter alia, that the increases
were designed to eliminate the vestiges of state-imposed segregation
by improving the "desegregative attractiveness" of the district and by
reversing "white flight" to the suburbs. The Court of Appeals also
approved the District Court's "implici[t]" rejection of the State's request for a determination of partial unitary status, under Freeman v.
Pitts, 503 U. S. 467, 491, with respect to the existing quality education programs.

Held:

1. Respondents' arguments that the State may no longer challenge
the District Court's desegregation remedy and that, in any event, the
propriety of the remedy is not before this Court are rejected. Because,
in Jenkins, 495 U. S., at 37, certiorari was granted to review the manner
in which this remedy was funded, but denied as to the State's challenge
to review the remedial order's scope, this Court resisted the State's
efforts to challenge such scope and, thus, neither approved nor disapproved the Court of Appeals' conclusion that the remedy was proper,
see, e. g., id., at 53. Here, however, the State has challenged the District Court's approval of across-the-board salary increases as beyond its
remedial authority. Because an analysis of the permissible scope of
that authority is necessary for a proper determination of whether the

salary increases exceed such authority, a challenge to the scope of the
remedy is fairly included in the question presented for review. See this
Court's Rule 14.1 and, e. g., Procunier v. Navarette, 434 U. S. 555, 560,
n. 6. Pp. 83-86.

2. The challenged orders are beyond the District Court's remedial
authority. Pp. 86-103.

(a) Although a District Court necessarily has discretion to fashion
a remedy for a school district unconstitutionally segregated in law, such
remedial power is not unlimited and may not be extended to purposes
beyond the elimination of racial discrimination in public schools.
Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed., 402 U. S. 1, 22-23. Proper
analysis of the orders challenged here must rest upon their serving as
proper means to the end of restoring the victims of discriminatory conduct to the position they would have occupied absent that conduct, see,
e. g., Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U. S. 717, 746, and their eventual restoration of state and local authorities to the control of a school system that
is operating in compliance with the Constitution, see, e. g., Freeman, 503
U. S., at 489. The factors that must inform a court's discretion in ordering complete or partial relief from a desegregation decree are:
(1) whether there has been compliance with the decree in those aspects
of the school system where federal supervision is to be withdrawn;
(2) whether retention of judicial control is necessary or practicable to
achieve compliance in other facets of the system; and (3) whether the
district has demonstrated to the public and to the parents and students
of the once disfavored race its good-faith commitment to the whole of
the decree and to those statutes and constitutional provisions that were
the predicate for judicial intervention in the first place. Id., at 491.
The ultimate inquiry is whether the constitutional violator has complied
in good faith with the decree since it was entered, and whether the
vestiges of discrimination have been eliminated to the extent practicable. Id., at 492. Pp. 86-89.

(b) The order approving salary increases, which was grounded in
improving the "desegregative attractiveness" of the KCMSD, exceeds
the District Court's admittedly broad discretion. The order should
have sought to eliminate to the extent practicable the vestiges of prior
de jure segregation within the KCMSD: a systemwide reduction in student achievement and the existence of 25 racially identifiable schools
with a population of over 90% black students. Instead, the District
Court created a magnet district of the KCMSD in order to attract nonminority students from the surrounding suburban school districts and to
redistribute them within the KCMSD schools. This interdistrict goal is
beyond the scope of the intradistrict violation identified by the District
Court. See, e. g., Milliken, supra, at 746-747. Indeed, the District

72 MISSOURI v. JENKINS

Syllabus
Court has found, and the Court of Appeals has affirmed, that the case
involved no interdistrict violation that would support interdistrict relief.
See, e. g., Jenkins, supra, at 37, n. 3. The District Court has devised a
remedy to accomplish indirectly what it admittedly lacks the remedial
authority to mandate directly: the interdistrict transfer of students.
See Milliken, 418 U. S., at 745. The record does not support the District Court's reliance on "white flight" as a justification for a permissible
expansion of its intradistrict remedial authority through its pursuit
of desegregative attractiveness. See, e. g., id., at 746. Moreover, that
pursuit cannot be reconciled with this Court's decisions placing limitations on a district court's remedial authority. See, e. g., ibid. Nor are
there appropriate limits to the duration of the District Court's involvement. See, e. g., Freeman, supra, at 489. Thus, the District Court's
pursuit of the goal of "desegregative attractiveness" results in too many
imponderables and is too far removed from the task of eliminating the
racial identifiability of the schools within the KCMSD. Pp. 89-100.

(c) Similarly, the order requiring the State to continue to fund the
quality education programs cannot be sustained. Whether or not
KCMSD student achievement levels are still "at or below national norms
at many grade levels" clearly is not the appropriate test for deciding
whether a previously segregated district has achieved partially unitary
status. The District Court should sharply limit, if not dispense with,
its reliance on this factor in reconsidering its order, and should instead
apply the three-part Freeman test. It should bear in mind that the
State's role with respect to the quality education programs has been
limited to the funding, not the implementation, of those programs; that
many of the goals of the quality education plan already have been attained; and that its end purpose is not only to remedy the violation
to the extent practicable, but also to restore control to state and local
authorities. Pp. 100-102.

74 MISSOURI v. JENKINS

Opinion of the Court

I
A general overview of this litigation is necessary forproper resolution of the issues upon which we granted certiorari. This case has been before the same United StatesDistrict Judge since 1977.

Missouri v. Jenkins, 491 U. S.274, 276 (1989) (Jenkins I). In that year, the KCMSD, the

school board, and the children of two school board membersbrought suit against the State and other defendants. Plaintiffs alleged that the State, the surrounding suburban schooldistricts (SSD's), and various federal agencies had caused
and perpetuated a system of racial segregation in the schoolsof the Kansas City metropolitan area. The District Court
realigned the KCMSD as a nominal defendant and certifiedas a class, present and future KCMSD students. The
KCMSD brought a cross-claim against the State for its fail-ure to eliminate the vestiges of its prior dual school system.

After a trial that lasted 71/2 months, the District Courtdismissed the case against the federal defendants and the
SSD's, but determined that the State and the KCMSD wereliable for an intradistrict violation,

i. e., they had operated asegregated school system within the KCMSD.

Jenkins v.Missouri, 593 F. Supp. 1485 (WD Mo. 1984). The District

Court determined that prior to 1954 "Missouri mandatedsegregated schools for black and white children." Id., at
1490. Furthermore, the KCMSD and the State had failedin their affirmative obligations to eliminate the vestiges of
the State's dual school system within the KCMSD. Id., at1504.

In June 1985, the District Court issued its first remedialorder and established as its goal the "elimination of all vestiges of state imposed segregation." Jenkins v. Missouri,639 F. Supp. 19, 23 (WD Mo. 1985). The District Court
determined that "[s]egregation ha[d] caused a system wide
reduction in student achievement in the schools of theKCMSD."

Id., at 24. The District Court made no particu-larized findings regarding the extent that student achieve515us1$67h 08-25-98 19:18:22 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
ment had been reduced or what portion of that reductionwas attributable to segregation. The District Court also

identified 25 schools within the KCMSD that had enrollmentsof 90% or more black students.

Id., at 36.
The District Court, pursuant to plans submitted by the
KCMSD and the State, ordered a wide range of quality edu-cation programs for all students attending the KCMSD.

First, the District Court ordered that the KCMSD be re-stored to an AAA classification, the highest classification
awarded by the State Board of Education. Id., at 26. Sec-ond, it ordered that the number of students per class be reduced so that the student-to-teacher ratio was below thelevel required for AAA standing.

Id., at 28-29. The District Court justified its reduction in class size as

"an essential part of any plan to remedy the vestiges
of segregation in the KCMSD. Reducing class size willserve to remedy the vestiges of past segregation by increasing individual attention and instruction, as well as
increasing the potential for desegregative educationalexperiences for KCMSD students by maintaining and

attracting non-minority enrollment." Id., at 29.
The District Court also ordered programs to expand educa-tional opportunities for all KCMSD students: full-day kindergarten; expanded summer school; before- and after-school
tutoring; and an early childhood development program. Id.,at 30-33. Finally, the District Court implemented a statefunded "effective schools" program that consisted of substan-tial yearly cash grants to each of the schools within the
KCMSD. Id., at 33-34. Under the "effective schools" program, the State was required to fund programs at both the
25 racially identifiable schools as well as the 43 other schools
within the KCMSD. Id., at 33.

The KCMSD was awarded an AAA rating in the 1987-
1988 school year, and there is no dispute that since that time
it has " `maintained and greatly exceeded AAA require515us1$67h 08-25-98 19:18:22 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
ments.' " 19 F. 3d 393, 401 (CA8 1994) (Beam, J., dissentingfrom denial of rehearing en banc). The total cost for these

quality education programs has exceeded $220 million. Mis-souri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education,
KCMSD Total Desegregation Program Expenditures (Sept.30, 1994) (Desegregation Expenditures).

The District Court also set out to desegregate the KCMSDbut believed that "[t]o accomplish desegregation within the
boundary lines of a school district whose enrollment remains68.3% black is a difficult task." 639 F. Supp., at 38. Because it had found no interdistrict violation, the DistrictCourt could not order mandatory interdistrict redistribution
of students between the KCMSD and the surrounding SSD's.Ibid.; see also Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U. S. 717 (1974)
(Milliken I). The District Court refused to order additionalmandatory student reassignments because they would "increase the instability of the KCMSD and reduce the potentialfor desegregation." 639 F. Supp., at 38. Relying on favorable precedent from the Eighth Circuit, the District Courtdetermined that "[a]chievement of AAA status, improvement of the quality of education being offered at the KCMSDschools, magnet schools, as well as other components of this
desegregation plan can serve to maintain and hopefully at-tract non-minority student enrollment."

Ibid.In November 1986, the District Court approved a comprehensive magnet school and capital improvements plan andheld the State and the KCMSD jointly and severally liable
for its funding. 1 App. 130-193. Under the District Court'splan, every senior high school, every middle school, and
one-half of the elementary schools were converted into mag-net schools.

1 Id., at 131. The District Court adopted the

away from their neighborhoods and private schools through distinctive
curricula and high quality." Missouri v. Jenkins, 495 U. S. 33, 40, n. 6
(1990).

Opinion of the Court
magnet-school program to "provide a greater educational op-portunity to

all KCMSD students," id., at 131-132, and because it believed "that the proposed magnet plan [was] soattractive that it would draw non-minority students from the

private schools who have abandoned or avoided the KCMSD,
and draw in additional non-minority students from thesuburbs."

Id., at 132. The District Court felt that "[t]he
long-term benefit of all KCMSD students of a greater edu-cational opportunity in an integrated environment is worthy

of such an investment." Id., at 133. Since its inception,the magnet-school program has operated at a cost, including magnet transportation, in excess of $448 million. See
Desegregation Expenditures. In April 1993, the District
Court considered, but ultimately rejected, the plaintiffs'
and the KCMSD's proposal seeking approval of a longrange magnet renewal program that included a 10-year
budget of well over $500 million, funded by the State and
the KCMSD on a joint-and-several basis. App. to Pet. for
Cert. A-123.

In June 1985, the District Court ordered substantial capital improvements to combat the deterioration of the KCMSD's
facilities. In formulating its capital-improvements plan,
the District Court dismissed as "irrelevant" the "State's
argument that the present condition of the facilities [was]
not traceable to unlawful segregation." 639 F. Supp., at
40. Instead, the District Court focused on its responsibility to "remed[y] the vestiges of segregation" and to "implemen[t] a desegregation plan which w[ould] maintain and
attract non-minority enrollment." Id., at 41. The initial
phase of the capital-improvements plan cost $37 million.
Ibid. The District Court also required the KCMSD to present further capital-improvements proposals "in order to
bring its facilities to a point comparable with the facilities in
neighboring suburban school districts." Ibid. In November 1986, the District Court approved further capital improvements in order to remove the vestiges of racial segre515us1$67h 08-25-98 19:18:22 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
gation and "to . . . attract non-minority students back to theKCMSD." App. to Pet. for Cert. A-133 to A-134.

In September 1987, the District Court adopted, for themost part, KCMSD's long-range capital-improvements plan
at a cost in excess of $187 million. Jenkins v. Missouri, 672
F. Supp. 400, 408 (WD Mo. 1987). The plan called for therenovation of approximately 55 schools, the closure of 18

facilities, and the construction of 17 new schools. Id., at 405.The District Court rejected what it referred to as the
" `patch and repair' approach proposed by the State" becauseit "would not achieve suburban comparability or the visual
attractiveness sought by the Court as it would result in floor
coverings with unsightly sections of mismatched carpeting
and tile, and individual walls possessing different shades of
paint." Id., at 404. The District Court reasoned that "if
the KCMSD schools underwent the limited renovation proposed by the State, the schools would continue to be unattractive and substandard, and would certainly serve as a
deterrent to parents considering enrolling their children
in KCMSD schools." Id., at 405. As of 1990, the District
Court had ordered $260 million in capital improvements.
Missouri v. Jenkins, 495 U. S. 33, 61 (1990) (Jenkins II)
(Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). Since then, the total cost of capital improvements
ordered has soared to over $540 million.

As part of its desegregation plan, the District Court has
ordered salary assistance to the KCMSD. In 1987, the District Court initially ordered salary assistance only for teachers within the KCMSD. Since that time, however, the District Court has ordered salary assistance to all but three of
the approximately 5,000 KCMSD employees. The total cost
of this component of the desegregation remedy since 1987 is
over $200 million. See Desegregation Expenditures.

The District Court's desegregation plan has been described as the most ambitious and expensive remedial program in the history of school desegregation. 19 F. 3d, at 397

79Cite as: 515 U. S. 70 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
(Beam, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc). Theannual cost per pupil at the KCMSD far exceeds that of

the neighboring SSD's or of any school district in Missouri.Nevertheless, the KCMSD, which has pursued a "friendly
adversary" relationship with the plaintiffs, has continued topropose ever more expensive programs.

2 As a result, the

desegregation costs have escalated and now are approachingan annual cost of $200 million. These massive expenditures

have financed

"high schools in which every classroom will have air con-ditioning, an alarm system, and 15 microcomputers; a

2,000-square-foot planetarium; green houses and vivari-ums; a 25-acre farm with an air-conditioned meeting
room for 104 people; a Model United Nations wired forlanguage translation; broadcast capable radio and television studios with an editing and animation lab; a temper-ature controlled art gallery; movie editing and screening
rooms; a 3,500-square-foot dust-free diesel mechanicsroom; 1,875-square-foot elementary school animal rooms
for use in a zoo project; swimming pools; and numerousother facilities."

Jenkins II, 495 U. S., at 77 (Kennedy,J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).

Not surprisingly, the cost of this remedial plan has "far ex-ceeded KCMSD's budget, or for that matter, its authority to
tax." Id., at 60. The State, through the operation of joint-and-several liability, has borne the brunt of these costs. The
District Court candidly has acknowledged that it has "al-lowed the District planners to dream" and "provided the

2 In April 1993, 16 years after this litigation began, the District Court
acknowledged that the KCMSD and the plaintiffs had "barely addressed
. . . how the KCMSD proposes to ultimately fund the school system developed under the desegregation plan." App. to Pet. for Cert. A-123. In
the context of a proposal to extend funding of the magnet-school program
for 10 additional years at a cost of over $500 million, the District Court
noted that "[t]he District's proposals do not include a viable method of
financing any of the programs." Id., at A-140.

mechanism for th[ose] dreams to be realized." App. to Pet.for Cert. A-133. In short, the District Court "has gone to

great lengths to provide KCMSD with facilities and opportu-nities not available anywhere else in the country." Id., at
A-115. II

With this background, we turn to the present controversy.First, the State has challenged the District Court's requirement that it fund salary increases for KCMSD instructionaland noninstructional staff.

Id., at A-76 to A-93 (DistrictCourt's Order of June 15, 1992); id., at A-94 to A-109 (District Court's Order of June 30, 1993); id., at A-110 to A-121(District Court's Order of July 30, 1993). The State claimed
that funding for salaries was beyond the scope of the DistrictCourt's remedial authority. Id., at A-86. Second, the State
has challenged the District Court's order requiring it to con-tinue to fund the remedial quality education programs for
the 1992-1993 school year. Id., at A-69 to A-75 (DistrictCourt's Order of June 17, 1992). The State contended that
under Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U. S. 467 (1992), it had achievedpartial unitary status with respect to the quality education
programs already in place. As a result, the State arguedthat the District Court should have relieved it of responsibility for funding those programs.The District Court rejected the State's arguments. It
first determined that the salary increases were warrantedbecause "[h]igh quality personnel are necessary not only to
implement specialized desegregation programs intended to`improve educational opportunities and reduce racial isolation', but also to `ensure that there is no diminution in thequality of its regular academic program.' " App. to Pet. for
Cert. A-87 (citations omitted). Its "ruling [was] groundedin remedying the vestiges of segregation by improving the
desegregative attractiveness of the KCMSD." Id., at A-90.The District Court did not address the State's

Freeman ar-guments; nevertheless, it ordered the State to continue to

Opinion of the Court
fund the quality education programs for the 1992-1993 schoolyear. See App. to Pet. for Cert. A-70.

The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed. 11F. 3d 755 (1993). It rejected the State's argument that the
salary increases did not directly address and relate to the
State's constitutional violation and that "low teacher salariesd[id] not flow from any earlier constitutional violations by

the State." Id., at 767. In doing so, it observed that "[i]naddition to compensating the victims, the remedy in this case
was also designed to reverse white flight by offering supe-rior educational opportunities."

Ibid.; see also 13 F. 3d
1170, 1172 (1993) (affirming the District Court's June 30,1993, and July 30, 1993, orders).

The Court of Appeals concluded that the District Court
implicitly had rejected the State's Freeman arguments inspite of the fact that it had failed "to articulate . . . even a

conclusory rejection" of them. 11 F. 3d, at 765. It lookedto the District Court's comments from the bench and its later
orders to "illuminate the June 1992 order." Id., at 761.The Court of Appeals relied on statements made by the District Court during a May 28, 1992, hearing:

"The Court's goal was to integrate the Kansas City, Missouri, School District to the maximum degree possible,and all these other matters were elements to be used to

try to integrate the Kansas City, Missouri, schools sothe goal is integration. That's the goal. And a high
standard of quality education. The magnet schools, the
summer school program and all these programs are tiedto that goal, and until such time as that goal has been

reached, then we have not reached the goal. . . . The goal
is to integrate the Kansas City, Missouri, School district.
So I think we are wasting our time." 2 App. 482 (emphasis added).

See 11 F. 3d, at 761. Apparently, the Court of Appeals extrapolated from the findings regarding the magnet-school

Opinion of the Court
program and later orders and imported those findings whole-sale to reject the State's request for a determination of partial unitary status as to the quality education programs.See id., at 761-762. It found significant the District Court's
determination that although "there had been a trend of im-provement in academic achievement, . . . the school district
was far from reaching its maximum potential becauseKCMSD is still at or below national norms at many grade
levels." Ibid. It went on to say that with respect to qual-ity education, "implementation of programs in and of itself is
not sufficient. The test, after all, is whether the vestiges ofsegregation, here the systemwide reduction in student
achievement, have been eliminated to the greatest extentpracticable. The success of quality of education programs
must be measured by their effect on the students, particu-larly those who have been the victims of segregation." Id.,
at 766.The Court of Appeals denied rehearing en banc, with five
judges dissenting. 19 F. 3d, at 395. The dissent first exam-ined the salary increases ordered by the District Court and
characterized "the current effort by the KCMSD and theAmerican Federation of Teachers . . . aided by the plaintiffs,
to bypass the collective bargaining process" as "uncalled for"and "probably not an exercise reasonably related to the constitutional violations found by the court." Id., at 399. Thedissent also "agree[d] with the [S]tate that logic d[id] not
directly relate the pay of parking lot attendants, trash haul-ers and food handlers . . . to any facet or phase of the desegregation plan or to the constitutional violations." Ibid.Second, the dissent believed that in evaluating whether
the KCMSD had achieved partial unitary status in its qualityeducation programs, the District Court and the panel had

"misrea[d] Freeman and create[d] a hurdle to the with-drawal of judicial intervention from public education
that has no support in the law. The district court has,

Opinion of the Court
with the approbation of the panel, imbedded a studentachievement goal measured by annual standardized

tests into its test of whether the KCMSD has built ahigh-quality educational system sufficient to remedy
past discrimination. The Constitution requires no such
standard." Id., at 400.

The dissent noted that "KCMSD students have in place asystem that offers more educational opportunity than anywhere in America," id., at 403, but that the District Courtwas " `not satisfied that the District has reached anywhere
close to its maximum potential because the District is still
at or below national norms at many grade levels,' " ibid. (em-phasis added). The dissent concluded that this case, "as it

now proceeds, involves an exercise in pedagogical sociology,not constitutional adjudication."

Id., at 404.
Because of the importance of the issues, we granted certio-rari to consider the following: (1) whether the District Court

exceeded its constitutional authority when it granted salaryincreases to virtually all instructional and noninstructional
employees of the KCMSD, and (2) whether the District
Court properly relied upon the fact that student achievement
test scores had failed to rise to some unspecified level when
it declined to find that the State had achieved partial unitary
status as to the quality education programs. 512 U. S.
1287 (1994).

Respondents argue that the State may no longer challenge
the District Court's remedy, and in any event, the propriety
of the remedy is not before the Court. Brief for Respondents KCMSD et al. 40-49; Brief for Respondents Jenkins
et al. 23. We disagree on both counts. In Jenkins II, we
granted certiorari to review the manner in which the District Court had funded this desegregation remedy. 495

Opinion of the Court
challenge to review the scope of the remedial order, weresisted the State's efforts to challenge the scope of the

remedy. Id., at 53; cf. id., at 80 (Kennedy, J., concurring inpart and concurring in judgment). Thus, we neither "approv[ed]" nor "disapprov[ed] the Court of Appeals' conclusion that the District Court's remedy was proper." Id., at 53.Here, however, the State has challenged the District

Court's approval of across-the-board salary increases for in-structional and noninstructional employees as an action beyond its remedial authority. Pet. for Cert. i.3 An analysisof the permissible scope of the District Court's remedial authority is necessary for a proper determination of whetherthe order of salary increases is beyond the District Court's
remedial authority, see Milliken I, 418 U. S., at 738-740, 745,and thus, it is an issue subsidiary to our ultimate inquiry.
Cf. Yee v. Escondido, 503 U. S. 519, 537 (1992). Given that
the District Court's basis for its salary order was groundedin "improving the desegregative attractiveness of the

KCMSD," App. to Pet. for Cert. A-90, we must considerthe propriety of that reliance in order to resolve properly
the State's challenge to that order. We conclude that a chal-lenge to the scope of the District Court's remedy is fairly
included in the question presented. See this Court's Rule14.1;

Procunier v. Navarette, 434 U. S. 555, 560, n. 6 (1978)
("Since consideration of these issues is essential to analysis
of the Court of Appeals' [decision] we shall also treat thesequestions as subsidiary issues `fairly comprised' by the question presented"); see also United States v. Mendenhall, 446
U. S. 544, 551-552, n. 5 (1980) (opinion of Stewart, J.) (Where

3 "Whether a federal court order granting salary increases to virtually
every employee of a school district--including non-instructional personnel--as part of a school desegregation remedy conflicts with applicable
decisions of this court which require that remedial components must directly address and relate to the constitutional violation and be tailored to
cure the condition that offends the Constitution?" Pet. for Cert. i.

the determination of a question "is essential to the correct
disposition of the other issues in the case, we shall treat it

Justice Souter argues that our decision to review the
scope of the District Court's remedial authority is both unfair
and imprudent. Post, at 147. He claims that factors such
as our failure to grant certiorari on the State's challenge to
the District Court's remedial authority in 1988 "lulled [respondents] into addressing the case without sufficient attention to the foundational issue, and their lack of attention has
now infected the Court's decision." Post, at 139. Justice
Souter concludes that we have "decide[d] the issue without
any warning to respondents." Post, at 147. These arguments are incorrect.

Of course, "[t]he denial of a writ of certiorari imports no
expression of opinion upon the merits of the case, as the bar
has been told many times." United States v. Carver, 260
U. S. 482, 490 (1923). A fortiori, far from lulling respondents into a false sense of security, our previous decision in
Jenkins v. Missouri put respondents on notice that the
Court had not affirmed the validity of the District Court's
remedy, 495 U. S., at 53, and that at least four Justices of the
Court questioned that remedy, id., at 75-80 (Kennedy, J.,
concurring in part and concurring in judgment).

With respect to the specific orders at issue here, the State
has once again challenged the scope of the District Court's
remedial authority. The District Court was aware of this
fact. See App. to Pet. for Cert. A-86 ("The State claims
that the Court should not approve desegregation funding for
salaries because such funding would be beyond the scope of
the Court's remedial authority") (District Court's June 25,
1992, order); id., at A-97 ("The State has argued repeatedly
and currently on appeal that the salary component is not a
valid component of the desegregation remedy") (District

86 MISSOURI v. JENKINS

Opinion of the Court
Court's June 30, 1993, order). The Court of Appeals alsounderstood that the State had renewed this challenge. See

11 F. 3d, at 766 ("The State argues first that the salary in-crease remedy sought exceeded that necessary to remedy
the constitutional violations, and alternatively, that if the district court had lawful authority to impose the increases, itabused its discretion in doing so");

id., at 767 ("The State's
legal argument is that the district court should have deniedthe salary increase funding because it is contrary to

Milliken
[v. Bradley, 433 U. S. 267 (1977),] and Swann [v. CharlotteMecklenburg Bd. of Ed., 402 U. S. 1 (1971),] in that it does
not directly address and relate to the State's constitutionalviolation"); 13 F. 3d, at 1172 ("We reject the State's argument

that the salary order is contrary to Milliken II and Swann").
The State renewed this same challenge in its petition forcertiorari, Pet. for Cert. i, and argued here that the District

Court's salary orders were beyond the scope of its remedialauthority. Brief for Petitioners 27-32; Reply Brief for Petitioners 6-12. In the 100 pages of briefing provided by re-spondents, they have argued that the State's challenge to the
scope of the District Court's remedial authority is not fairlypresented

and is meritless. See Brief for Respondents
KCMSD et al. 40-49; Brief for Respondents Jenkins et al.
2-21, 44-49; cf. Reply Brief for Petitioners 2 ("[R]espondents
. . . urge the Court to dismiss the writ as improvidently
granted. This is not surprising; respondents cannot defend
the excesses of the courts below").

In short, the State has challenged the scope of the District
Court's remedial authority. The District Court, the Court
of Appeals, and respondents have recognized this to be the
case. Contrary to Justice Souter's arguments, there is no
unfairness or imprudence in deciding issues that have been
passed upon below, are properly before us, and have been
briefed by the parties. We turn to the questions presented.

Almost 25 years ago, in Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg
Bd. of Ed., 402 U. S. 1 (1971), we dealt with the authority of
a district court to fashion remedies for a school district that

515us1$67h 08-25-98 19:18:22 PAGES OPINPGT

87Cite as: 515 U. S. 70 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
had been segregated in law in violation of the Equal Pro-tection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Although

recognizing the discretion that must necessarily adhere in adistrict court in fashioning a remedy, we also recognized
the limits on such remedial power:

"[E]limination of racial discrimination in public schools
is a large task and one that should not be retarded byefforts to achieve broader purposes lying beyond the

jurisdiction of the school authorities. One vehicle can
carry only a limited amount of baggage. It would notserve the important objective of

Brown [v. Board of
Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954),] to seek to use schooldesegregation cases for purposes beyond their scope,

although desegregation of schools ultimately will haveimpact on other forms of discrimination."

Id., at 22-
23.

Three years later, in Milliken I, 418 U. S. 717 (1974), we
held that a District Court had exceeded its authority in fash-ioning interdistrict relief where the surrounding school districts had not themselves been guilty of any constitutionalviolation.

Id., at 746-747. We said that a desegregation
remedy "is necessarily designed, as all remedies are, to re-store the victims of discriminatory conduct to the position

they would have occupied in the absence of such conduct."
Id., at 746. "[W]ithout an interdistrict violation and inter-district effect, there is no constitutional wrong calling for an

interdistrict remedy." Id., at 745. We also rejected "[t]hesuggestion . . . that schools which have a majority of Negro
students are not `desegregated,' whatever the makeup of theschool district's population and however neutrally the district lines have been drawn and administered." Id., at 747,n. 22; see also

Freeman, 503 U. S., at 474 ("[A] critical beginning point is the degree of racial imbalance in the school
district, that is to say a comparison of the proportion ofmajority to minority students in individual schools with the

proportions of the races in the district as a whole").

88 MISSOURI v. JENKINS

Opinion of the Court
Three years later, in Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U. S. 267(1977) (Milliken II), we articulated a three-part framework

derived from our prior cases to guide district courts in theexercise of their remedial authority.

"In the first place, like other equitable remedies, thenature of the desegregation remedy is to be determined
by the nature and scope of the constitutional violation.
Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education,402 U. S., at 16. The remedy must therefore be related

to `the condition alleged to offend the Constitution. . . .'Milliken I, 418 U. S., at 738. Second, the decree must
indeed be remedial in nature, that is, it must be de-signed as nearly as possible `to restore the victims of
discriminatory conduct to the position they would haveoccupied in the absence of such conduct.'

Id., at 746.Third, the federal courts in devising a remedy must take

into account the interests of state and local authoritiesin managing their own affairs, consistent with the Constitution." Id., at 280-281 (footnotes omitted).
We added that the "principle that the nature and scope ofthe remedy are to be determined by the violation means

simply that federal-court decrees must directly address andrelate to the constitutional violation itself."

Id., at 281-282.In applying these principles, we have identified "student assignments, . . . `faculty, staff, transportation, extracurricularactivities and facilities' " as the most important indicia of a
racially segregated school system. Board of Ed. of Oklahoma City Public Schools v. Dowell, 498 U. S. 237, 250 (1991)(quoting Green v. School Bd. of New Kent Cty., 391 U. S. 430,

435 (1968)).Because "federal supervision of local school systems was
intended as a temporary measure to remedy past discrimina-tion,"

Dowell, supra, at 247, we also have considered theshowing that must be made by a school district operating

under a desegregation order for complete or partial relieffrom that order. In Freeman, we stated that

515us1$67h 08-25-98 19:18:22 PAGES OPINPGT

89Cite as: 515 U. S. 70 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
"[a]mong the factors which must inform the sound dis-cretion of the court in ordering partial withdrawal are

the following: [1] whether there has been full and satis-factory compliance with the decree in those aspects of
the system where supervision is to be withdrawn; [2]whether retention of judicial control is necessary or
practicable to achieve compliance with the decree inother facets of the school system; and [3] whether the
school district has demonstrated, to the public and tothe parents and students of the once disfavored race, its
good-faith commitment to the whole of the courts' de-cree and to those provisions of the law and the Constitution that were the predicate for judicial intervention inthe first instance." 503 U. S., at 491.

The ultimate inquiry is " `whether the [constitutional viola-tor] ha[s] complied in good faith with the desegregation decree since it was entered, and whether the vestiges of pastdiscrimination ha[ve] been eliminated to the extent practicable.' " Id., at 492 (quoting Dowell, supra, at 249-250).Proper analysis of the District Court's orders challenged
here, then, must rest upon their serving as proper means tothe end of restoring the victims of discriminatory conduct to
the position they would have occupied in the absence of thatconduct and their eventual restoration of "state and local authorities to the control of a school system that is operatingin compliance with the Constitution." 503 U. S., at 489. We
turn to that analysis.The State argues that the order approving salary increases is beyond the District Court's authority because itwas crafted to serve an "interdistrict goal," in spite of the
fact that the constitutional violation in this case is "intradis-trict" in nature. Brief for Petitioners 19. "[T]he nature of
the desegregation remedy is to be determined by the natureand scope of the constitutional violation." Milliken II,
supra, at 280; Pasadena City Bd. of Ed. v. Spangler, 427U. S. 424, 434 (1976) (" `[T]here are limits' beyond which a

court may not go in seeking to dismantle a dual school sys-tem"). The proper response to an intradistrict violation is

an intradistrict remedy, see Milliken I, supra, at 746-747;Milliken II, supra, at 280, that serves to eliminate the racial
identity of the schools within the affected school district byeliminating, as far as practicable, the vestiges of

de jure seg-regation in all facets of their operations. See Dowell, supra,

at 250; see also Swann, 402 U. S., at 18-19; Green, supra,at 435.

Here, the District Court has found, and the Court of Ap-peals has affirmed, that this case involved no interdistrict
constitutional violation that would support interdistrict re-lief.

Jenkins II, 495 U. S., at 37, n. 3 ("The District Courtalso found that none of the alleged discriminatory actions

had resulted in lingering interdistrict effects and so dis-missed the suburban school districts and denied interdistrict
relief "); id., at 76 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and con-curring in judgment) ("[T]here was no interdistrict constitutional violation that would support mandatory interdistrict
relief ").4 Thus, the proper response by the District Courtshould have been to eliminate to the extent practicable the

vestiges of prior de jure segregation within the KCMSD: a
systemwide reduction in student achievement and theexistence of 25 racially identifiable schools with a population

of over 90% black students. 639 F. Supp., at 24, 36.

Opinion of the Court
The District Court and Court of Appeals, however, havefelt that because the KCMSD's enrollment remained 68.3%

black, a purely intradistrict remedy would be insufficient.
Id., at 38; Jenkins v. Missouri, 855 F. 2d 1296, 1302 (CA8
1988) ("[V]oluntary interdistrict remedies may be used to

make meaningful integration possible in a predominantly mi-nority district"). But, as noted in

Milliken I, 418 U. S. 717
(1974), we have rejected the suggestion "that schools whichhave a majority of Negro students are not `desegregated'

whatever the racial makeup of the school district's populationand however neutrally the district lines have been drawn
and administered." Id., at 747, n. 22; see Milliken II, 433U. S., at 280, n. 14 ("[T]he Court has consistently held that
the Constitution is not violated by racial imbalance in the
schools, without more"); Spangler, supra, at 434.5Instead of seeking to remove the racial identity of the various schools within the KCMSD, the District Court has set
out on a program to create a school district that was equal
to or superior to the surrounding SSD's. Its remedy has
focused on "desegregative attractiveness," coupled with
"suburban comparability." Examination of the District
Court's reliance on "desegregative attractiveness" and "suburban comparability" is instructive for our ultimate resolution of the salary-order issue.

The purpose of desegregative attractiveness has been not
only to remedy the systemwide reduction in student achievement, but also to attract nonminority students not presently
enrolled in the KCMSD. This remedy has included an elaborate program of capital improvements, course enrichment,

Opinion of the Court
and extracurricular enhancement not simply in the formerlyidentifiable black schools, but in schools throughout the district. The District Court's remedial orders have convertedevery senior high school, every middle school, and one-half of
the elementary schools in the KCMSD into "magnet" schools.
The District Court's remedial order has all but made theKCMSD itself into a magnet district.

We previously have approved of intradistrict desegrega-tion remedies involving magnet schools. See,

e. g., Milliken
II, supra, at 272. Magnet schools have the advantage ofencouraging voluntary movement of students within a school

district in a pattern that aids desegregation on a voluntary
basis, without requiring extensive busing and redrawing of
district boundary lines. Cf. Jenkins II, supra, at 59-60
(Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (citing Milliken II, supra, at 272). As a component
in an intradistrict remedy, magnet schools also are attractive
because they promote desegregation while limiting the withdrawal of white student enrollment that may result from
mandatory student reassignment. See 639 F. Supp., at 37;
cf. United States v. Scotland Neck City Bd. of Ed., 407 U. S.
484, 491 (1972).

The District Court's remedial plan in this case, however,
is not designed solely to redistribute the students within the
KCMSD in order to eliminate racially identifiable schools
within the KCMSD. Instead, its purpose is to attract nonminority students from outside the KCMSD schools. But
this interdistrict goal is beyond the scope of the intradistrict
violation identified by the District Court. In effect, the District Court has devised a remedy to accomplish indirectly
what it admittedly lacks the remedial authority to mandate
directly: the interdistrict transfer of students. 639 F. Supp.,
at 38 (" `[B]ecause of restrictions on this Court's remedial
powers in restructuring the operations of local and state
government entities,' any mandatory plan which would
go beyond the boundary lines of KCMSD goes far beyond

Opinion of the Court
the nature and extent of the constitutional violation [that]this Court found existed").

In Milliken I we determined that a desegregation remedythat would require mandatory interdistrict reassignment of
students throughout the Detroit metropolitan area was an
impermissible interdistrict response to the intradistrict vio-lation identified. 418 U. S., at 745. In that case, the lower

courts had ordered an interdistrict remedy because " `anyless comprehensive a solution than a metropolitan area plan
would result in an all black school system immediately sur-rounded by practically all white suburban school systems,
with an overwhelmingly white majority population in the
total metropolitan area.' " Id., at 735. We held that before
a district court could order an interdistrict remedy, there
must be a showing that "racially discriminatory acts of the
state or local school districts, or of a single school district
have been a substantial cause of interdistrict segregation."
Id., at 745. Because the record "contain[ed] evidence of de
jure segregated conditions only in the Detroit Schools" and
there had been "no showing of significant violation by the
53 outlying school districts and no evidence of interdistrict
violation or effect," we reversed the District Court's grant
of interdistrict relief. Ibid.

Justice Stewart provided the Court's fifth vote and wrote
separately to underscore his understanding of the decision.
In describing the requirements for imposing an "interdistrict" remedy, Justice Stewart stated: "Were it to be shown,
for example, that state officials had contributed to the separation of the races by drawing or redrawing school district
lines; by transfer of school units between districts; or by purposeful, racially discriminatory use of state housing or zoning
laws, then a decree calling for the transfer of pupils across
district lines or for restructuring of district lines might well
be appropriate. In this case, however, no such interdistrict
violation was shown." Id., at 755 (concurring opinion) (citations omitted). Justice Stewart concluded that the Court

515us1$67h 08-25-98 19:18:22 PAGES OPINPGT
94 MISSOURI v. JENKINS

Opinion of the Court
properly rejected the District Court's interdistrict remedybecause "[t]here were no findings that the differing racial

composition between schools in the city and in the outlyingsuburbs was caused by official activity of any sort." Id., at
757.What we meant in

Milliken I by an interdistrict violationwas a violation that caused segregation between adjoining

districts. Nothing in Milliken I suggests that the DistrictCourt in that case could have circumvented the limits on
its remedial authority by requiring the State of Michigan, aconstitutional violator, to implement a magnet program designed to achieve the same interdistrict transfer of studentsthat we held was beyond its remedial authority. Here, the
District Court has done just that: created a magnet districtof the KCMSD in order to serve the

interdistrict goal ofattracting nonminority students from the surrounding SSD's

and redistributing them within the KCMSD. The DistrictCourt's pursuit of "desegregative attractiveness" is beyond
the scope of its broad remedial authority. See Milliken II,433 U. S., at 280.

Respondents argue that the District Court's reliance upondesegregative attractiveness is justified in light of the District Court's statement that segregation has "led to whiteflight from the KCMSD to suburban districts." 1 App. 126;
see Brief for Respondents KCMSD et al. 44-45, and n. 28;Brief for Respondents Jenkins et al. 47-49.

6 Prior to 1954, Missouri mandated segregated schools for black and
white children. Jenkins v. Missouri, 593 F. Supp. 1485, 1490 (WD Mo.
1984). Immediately after the Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954), the State's Attorney General issued an opinion
declaring the provisions that mandated segregation unenforceable. 593
F. Supp., at 1490. In the 1954-1955 school year, 18.9% of the KCMSD's
students were black. 807 F. 2d, at 680. The KCMSD became 30% black
in the 1961-1962 school year, 40% black in the 1965-1966 school year, and
60% black in the 1975-1976 school year. Ibid. In 1977, the KCMSD implemented the 6C desegregation plan in order to ensure that each school
within the KCMSD had a minimum minority enrollment of 30%. Jenkins

courts' "findings" as to "white flight" are both inconsistentinternally,

7 and inconsistent with the typical supposition, bolstered here by the record evidence, that "white flight" mayresult from desegregation, not de jure segregation.

8 The

United States, as amicus curiae, argues that the DistrictCourt's finding that "

de jure segregation in the KCMSDcaused white students to leave the system . . . is not inconsistent with the district court's earlier conclusion that thesuburban districts did nothing to cause this white flight and
therefore could not be included in a mandatory interdistrictremedy." Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 19,
n. 2; see also post, at 160-164. But the District Court's ear-lier findings, affirmed by the Court of Appeals, were not so
limited:

"[C]ontrary to the argument of [plaintiffs] that the [dis-trict court] looked only to the culpability of the SSDs,

the scope of the order is far broader. . . . It noted thatonly the schools in one district were affected and that
the remedy must be limited to that system. In examin-ing the cause and effect issue, the court noted that `not
only is plaintiff 's evidence here blurred as to cause and
v. Missouri, 639 F. Supp. 19, 35 (WD Mo. 1985). Overall enrollment
in KCMSD decreased by 30% from the time that the 6C plan first was implemented until 1986. Id., at 36. During the same time period, white
enrollment decreased by 44%. Ibid.

7 Compare n. 4, supra, and Jenkins, 807 F. 2d, at 662 ("[N]one of the

alleged discriminatory actions committed by the State or the federal defendants ha[s] caused any significant current interdistrict segregation"),
with Jenkins v. Missouri, 855 F. 2d 1295, 1302 (CA8 1988) ("These holdings
are bolstered by the district court's findings that the preponderance of
black students in the district was due to the State and KCMSD's constitutional violations, which caused white flight").

8 "During the hearing on the liability issue in this case there was an

abundance of evidence that many residents of the KCMSD left the district
and moved to the suburbs because of the district's efforts to integrate its
schools." 1 App. 239; see also Scotland Neck City Bd. of Ed., 407 U. S.,
at 491 (recognizing that implementation of a desegregation remedy may
result in "white flight").

effect, there is no "careful delineation of the extent ofthe effect." ' . . . The district court thus dealt not only

with the issue whether the SSDs were constitutionalviolators but also whether there were significant interdistrict segregative effects. . . . When it did so, it madespecific findings that negate current significant interdistrict effects, and concluded that the requirements ofMilliken had not been met."

Jenkins v. Missouri, 807F. 2d 657, 672 (CA8 1986) (affirming, by an equally divided court, the District Court's findings and conclusionthat there was no interdistrict violation or interdistrict
effect) (en banc).9
In Freeman, we stated that "[t]he vestiges of segregationthat are the concern of the law in a school case may be subtle

and intangible but nonetheless they must be so real that theyhave a causal link to the

de jure violation being remedied."503 U. S., at 496. The record here does not support the District Court's reliance on "white flight" as a justification for apermissible expansion of its intradistrict remedial authority
through its pursuit of desegregative attractiveness. See
Milliken I, 418 U. S., at 746; see also Dayton Bd. of Ed. v.
Brinkman, 433 U. S. 406, 417 (1977) (Dayton I).

Justice Souter claims that our holding effectively over-rules

Hills v. Gautreaux, 425 U. S. 284 (1976). See also
Brief for American Civil Liberties Union et al. as Amici
Curiae 18-20. In Gautreaux, the Federal Department of

9 Justice Souter construes the Court of Appeals' determination to
mean that the violations by the State and the KCMSD did not cause segregation within the limits of each of the SSD's. Post, at 163-164. But
the Court of Appeals would not have decided this question at the behest
of these plaintiffs--present and future KCMSD students--who have no
standing to challenge segregation within the confines of the SSD's. Cf.
Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 560-561 (1992). Ergo, the
Court of Appeals meant exactly what it said: the requirements of Milliken
I had not been met because the District Court's specific findings "negate
current significant interdistrict effects." Jenkins, 807 F. 2d, at 672.

Opinion of the Court
Housing and Urban Development (HUD) was found to haveparticipated, along with a local housing agency, in establishing and maintaining a racially segregated public housing pro-gram. 425 U. S., at 286-291. After the Court of Appeals
ordered " `the adoption of a comprehensive metropolitan area
plan,' " id., at 291, we granted certiorari to consider the "per-missibility in light of

[Milliken I] of `inter-district relief for
discrimination in public housing in the absence of a findingof an inter-district violation.' "

Gautreaux, supra, at 292.
Because the "relevant geographic area for purposes of the[plaintiffs'] housing options [was] the Chicago housing market, not the Chicago city limits," 425 U. S., at 299, we concluded that "a metropolitan area remedy . . . [was] not impermissible as a matter of law," id., at 306. Cf. id., at 298, n. 13
(distinguishing Milliken I, in part, because prior cases had
established that racial segregation in schools is "to be dealt
with in terms of `an established geographic and administrative school system' ").

In Gautreaux, we did not obligate the District Court to
"subjec[t] HUD to measures going beyond the geographical or political boundaries of its violation." Post, at 171-
172. Instead, we cautioned that our holding "should not be
interpreted as requiring a metropolitan area order." Gautreaux, 425 U. S., at 306. We reversed appellate factfinding
by the Court of Appeals that would have mandated a
metropolitan-area remedy, see id., at 294-295, n. 11, and remanded the case back to the District Court " `for additional
evidence and for further consideration of the issue of metropolitan area relief,' " id., at 306.

Our decision today is fully consistent with Gautreaux. A
district court seeking to remedy an intradistrict violation
that has not "directly caused" significant interdistrict effects,
Milliken I, supra, at 744-745, exceeds its remedial authority
if it orders a remedy with an interdistrict purpose. This
conclusion follows directly from Milliken II, decided one
year after Gautreaux, where we reaffirmed the bedrock

principle that "federal-court decrees exceed appropriate lim-its if they are aimed at eliminating a condition that does not

violate the Constitution or does not flow from such a viola-tion." 433 U. S., at 282. In

Milliken II, we also emphasized that "federal courts in devising a remedy must take
into account the interests of state and local authorities inmanaging their own affairs, consistent with the Constitution." Id., at 280-281. Gautreaux, however, involved theimposition of a remedy upon a federal agency. See 425 U. S.,
at 292, n. 9. Thus, it did not raise the same federalismconcerns that are implicated when a federal court issues a
remedial order against a State. See Milliken II, supra, at
280-281.

The District Court's pursuit of "desegregative attractiveness" cannot be reconciled with our cases placing limitations
on a district court's remedial authority. It is certainly theoretically possible that the greater the expenditure per pupil
within the KCMSD, the more likely it is that some unknowable number of nonminority students not presently attending
schools in the KCMSD will choose to enroll in those schools.
Under this reasoning, however, every increased expenditure,
whether it be for teachers, noninstructional employees,
books, or buildings, will make the KCMSD in some way more
attractive, and thereby perhaps induce nonminority students
to enroll in its schools. But this rationale is not susceptible
to any objective limitation. Cf. Milliken II, supra, at 280
(remedial decree "must be designed as nearly as possible `to
restore the victims of discriminatory conduct to the position
they would have occupied in the absence of such conduct' ").
This case provides numerous examples demonstrating the
limitless authority of the District Court operating under this
rationale. See, e. g., App. to Pet. for Cert. A-115 (The District Court has recognized that it has "provide[d] the
KCMSD with facilities and opportunities not available anywhere else in the country"); id., at A-140 ("The District has
repeatedly requested that the [District Court] provide ex515us1$67h 08-25-98 19:18:22 PAGES OPINPGT

travagant programs based on the hopes that they will succeed in the desegregation effort"). In short, desegregative
attractiveness has been used "as the hook on which to hang
numerous policy choices about improving the quality of
education in general within the KCMSD." Jenkins II, 495
U. S., at 76 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring
in judgment).

Nor are there limits to the duration of the District Court's
involvement. The expenditures per pupil in the KCMSD
currently far exceed those in the neighboring SSD's. 19 F.
3d, at 399 (Beam, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en
banc) (per-pupil costs within the SSD's, excluding capital
costs, range from $2,854 to $5,956; per-pupil costs within the
KCMSD, excluding capital costs, are $9,412); Brief for Respondent KCMSD et al. 18, n. 5 (arguing that per-pupil costs
in the KCMSD, excluding capital costs, are $7,665.18). Sixteen years after this litigation began, the District Court recognized that the KCMSD has yet to offer a viable method of
financing the "wonderful school system being built." App.
to Pet. for Cert. A-124; cf. Milliken II, supra, at 293 (Powell,
J., concurring in judgment) ("Th[e] parties . . . have now
joined forces apparently for the purpose of extracting funds
from the state treasury"). Each additional program ordered
by the District Court--and financed by the State--to increase the "desegregative attractiveness" of the school
district makes the KCMSD more and more dependent on
additional funding from the State; in turn, the greater the
KCMSD's dependence on state funding, the greater its reliance on continued supervision by the District Court. But
our cases recognize that local autonomy of school districts is
a vital national tradition, Dayton I, 433 U. S., at 410, and
that a district court must strive to restore state and local
authorities to the control of a school system operating in
compliance with the Constitution. See Freeman, 503 U. S.,
at 489; Dowell, 498 U. S., at 247.

100 MISSOURI v. JENKINS

Opinion of the Court
The District Court's pursuit of the goal of "desegregative
attractiveness" results in so many imponderables and is so
far removed from the task of eliminating the racial identifiability of the schools within the KCMSD that we believe it
is beyond the admittedly broad discretion of the District
Court. In this posture, we conclude that the District
Court's order of salary increases, which was "grounded in
remedying the vestiges of segregation by improving the desegregative attractiveness of the KCMSD," App. to Pet. for
Cert. A-90, is simply too far removed from an acceptable
implementation of a permissible means to remedy previous
legally mandated segregation. See Milliken II, 433 U. S.,
at 280.

Similar considerations lead us to conclude that the District
Court's order requiring the State to continue to fund the
quality education programs because student achievement
levels were still "at or below national norms at many grade
levels" cannot be sustained. The State does not seek from
this Court a declaration of partial unitary status with respect to the quality education programs. Reply Brief for
Petitioners 3. It challenges the requirement of indefinite
funding of a quality education program until national norms
are met, based on the assumption that while a mandate for
significant educational improvement, both in teaching and
in facilities, may have been justified originally, its indefinite
extension is not.

Our review in this respect is needlessly complicated because the District Court made no findings in its order approving continued funding of the quality education programs. See App. to Pet. for Cert. A-69 to A-75. Although
the Court of Appeals later recognized that a determination
of partial unitary status requires "careful factfinding and detailed articulation of findings," 11 F. 3d, at 765, it declined
to remand to the District Court. Instead it attempted to
assemble an adequate record from the District Court's state515us1$67h 08-25-98 19:18:22 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
ments from the bench and subsequent orders. Id., at 761.In one such order relied upon by the Court of Appeals, the

District Court stated that the KCMSD had not reached any-where close to its "maximum potential because the District
is still at or below national norms at many grade levels."App. to Pet. for Cert. A-131.

But this clearly is not the appropriate test to be appliedin deciding whether a previously segregated district has
achieved partially unitary status. See Freeman, supra, at491;

Dowell, 498 U. S., at 249-250. The basic task of theDistrict Court is to decide whether the reduction in achievement by minority students attributable to prior de juresegregation has been remedied to the extent practicable.
Under our precedents, the State and the KCMSD are "enti-tled to a rather precise statement of [their] obligations under
a desegregation decree." Id., at 246. Although the DistrictCourt has determined that "[s]egregation has caused a system wide reduction in achievement in the schools of theKCMSD," 639 F. Supp., at 24, it never has identified the
incremental effect that segregation has had on minoritystudent achievement or the specific goals of the quality
education programs. Cf. Dayton I, supra, at 420.10In reconsidering this order, the District Court should

apply our three-part test from Freeman v. Pitts, supra, at491. The District Court should consider that the State's
role with respect to the quality education programs has beenlimited to the funding, not the implementation, of those programs. As all the parties agree that improved achievementon test scores is not necessarily required for the State to
achieve partial unitary status as to the quality education pro-grams, the District Court should sharply limit, if not dispense with, its reliance on this factor. Brief for Respond10 To the extent that the District Court has adopted the quality education program to further the goal of desegregative attractiveness, that goal
is no longer valid. See supra, at 91-100.

Opinion of the Court
ents KCMSD et al. 34-35; Brief for Respondents Jenkins etal. 26. Just as demographic changes independent of

de jure
segregation will affect the racial composition of student as-signments,

Freeman, 503 U. S., at 494-495, so too will numerous external factors beyond the control of the KCMSD
and the State affect minority student achievement. So longas these external factors are not the result of segregation,

they do not figure in the remedial calculus. See Spangler,427 U. S., at 434;

Swann, 402 U. S., at 22. Insistence upon
academic goals unrelated to the effects of legal segregationunwarrantably postpones the day when the KCMSD will be

able to operate on its own.

The District Court also should consider that many goals
of its quality education plan already have been attained: the
KCMSD now is equipped with "facilities and opportunities
not available anywhere else in the country." App. to Pet.
for Cert. A-115. KCMSD schools received an AAA rating
eight years ago, and the present remedial programs have
been in place for seven years. See 19 F. 3d, at 401 (Beam,
J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc). It may
be that in education, just as it may be in economics, a
"rising tide lifts all boats," but the remedial quality education program should be tailored to remedy the injuries suffered by the victims of prior de jure segregation. See Milliken II, supra, at 287. Minority students in kindergarten
through grade 7 in the KCMSD always have attended AAArated schools; minority students in the KCMSD that previously attended schools rated below AAA have since received remedial education programs for a period of up to
seven years.

On remand, the District Court must bear in mind that
its end purpose is not only "to remedy the violation" to the
extent practicable, but also "to restore state and local authorities to the control of a school system that is operating in compliance with the Constitution." Freeman, supra,
at 489.

I reject the State's contention that the propriety of theDistrict Court's remedy is fairly included in the question

whether student achievement is a valid measure of partialunitary status as to the quality education program, Brief for
Petitioners 18.The State, however, also challenges the District Court's
order setting salaries for all but 3 of the 5,000 persons
employed by the Kansas City, Missouri, School District(KCMSD). In that order, the court stated: "[T]he basis for

this Court's ruling is grounded in remedying the vestiges of
segregation by improving the desegregative attractiveness
of the KCMSD. In order to improve the desegregative attractiveness of the KCMSD, the District must hire and retain high quality teachers, administrators and staff." App.
to Pet. for Cert. A-90. The question presented in the petition for certiorari asks whether the order comports with our
cases requiring that remedies "address and relate to the constitutional violation and be tailored to cure the condition that
offends the Constitution," Pet. for Cert. i. Thus, the State
asks not only whether salary increases are an appropriate
means to achieve the District Court's goal of desegregative
attractiveness, but also whether that goal itself legitimately
relates to the predicate constitutional violation. The propriety of desegregative attractiveness as a remedial purpose, therefore, is not simply an issue "prior to the clearly
presented question," Lebron, supra, at 382; it is an issue
presented in the question itself and, as such, is one that

we appropriately and necessarily consider in answering thatquestion.

Beyond the plain words of the question presented, theState's opening brief placed respondents on notice of its argument; fully 25 of the State's 30 pages of discussion were
devoted to desegregative attractiveness and suburban com-parability. See Brief for Petitioners 19-45. Such focus

should not come as a surprise. At every stage of this litiga-tion, as the Court notes,

ante, at 85-86, the State has questioned whether the salary increase order exceeded the na-ture and scope of the constitutional violation. In disposing

of the argument, the lower courts explicitly relied on the
need for desegregative attractiveness and suburban comparability. See, e. g., 13 F. 3d, 1170, 1172 (CA8 1993) ("The significant finding of the court with respect to the earlier funding order was that the salary increases were essential to
comply with the court's desegregation orders, and that high
quality teachers, administrators, and staff must be hired to
improve the desegregative attractiveness of KCMSD"); 11
F. 3d 755, 767 (CA8 1993) ("In addition to compensating the victims, the remedy in this case was also designed to reverse
white flight by offering superior educational opportunities").

Given the State's persistence and the specificity of the
lower court decisions, respondents would have ignored the
State's arguments on white flight and desegregative attractiveness at their own peril. But they did not do so, and instead engaged those arguments on the merits. See Brief
for Respondents KCMSD et al. 44-49; Brief for Respondents
Jenkins et al. 41-49. Perhaps the response was not made as
artfully and completely as the dissenting Justices would like,
but it was made nevertheless; whatever the cause of respondents' supposed failure to appreciate "what was really
at stake," post, at 139 (Souter, J., dissenting), it is certainly
not lack of fair notice.

Given such notice, there is no unfairness to the Court
resolving the issue. Unlike Bray v. Alexandria Women's

Health Clinic, 506 U. S. 263 (1993), for example, where inorder to decide a particular question, one would have had to

"find in the complaint claims that the respondents them-selves have admitted are not there; . . . resolve a question
not presented to, or ruled on by, any lower court; . . . revise
the rule that it is the petition for certiorari (not the brief inopposition and later briefs) that determines the questions

presented; and . . . penalize the parties for not addressing anissue on which the Court specifically denied supplemental
briefing," id., at 280-281, in this case one need only readthe opinions below to see that the question of desegregative
attractiveness was presented to and passed upon by the
lower courts; the petition for certiorari to see that it was
properly presented; and the briefs to see that it was fully
argued on the merits. If it could be thought that deciding
the question in Bray presented no "unfairness" because it
"was briefed, albeit sparingly, by the parties prior to the
first oral argument," id., at 291 (Souter, J., concurring in
judgment in part and dissenting in part), there should hardly
be cause to cry foul here. The Court today transgresses no
bounds of orderly adjudication in resolving a genuine dispute
that is properly presented for its decision.

On the merits, the Court's resolution of the dispute comports with Hills v. Gautreaux, 425 U. S. 284 (1976). There,
we held that there is no "per se rule that federal courts lack
authority to order parties found to have violated the Constitution to undertake remedial efforts beyond the municipal
boundaries of the city where the violation occurred," id., at
298. This holding follows from our judgment in Milliken v.
Bradley, 418 U. S. 717 (1974) (Milliken I), that an interdistrict remedy is permissible, but only upon a showing that
"there has been a constitutional violation within one district
that produces a significant segregative effect in another district," id., at 745. The per se rule that the petitioner urged
upon the Court in Gautreaux would have erected an "arbitrary and mechanical" shield at the city limits, 425 U. S., at

O'Connor, J., concurring
300, and contradicted the holding in Milliken I that remediesmay go beyond the boundaries of the constitutional violator.

Gautreaux, however, does not eliminate the requirement of
Milliken I that such territorial transgression is permissible
only upon a showing that the intradistrict constitutional violation produced significant interdistrict segregative effects;if anything, our opinion repeatedly affirmed that principle,

see Gautreaux, supra, at 292-294, 296, n. 12. More impor-tant for our purposes here,

Gautreaux in no way contravenes
the underlying principle that the scope of desegregationremedies, even those that are solely intradistrict, is "determined by the nature and extent of the constitutional violation." Milliken I, supra, at 744 (citing Swann v. CharlotteMecklenburg Bd. of Ed., 402 U. S. 1, 16 (1971)). Gautreaux
simply does not give federal courts a blank check to impose
unlimited remedies upon a constitutional violator.

As an initial matter, Gautreaux itself may not even have
concerned a case of interdistrict relief, at least not in the
sense that Milliken I and other school desegregation cases
have understood it. Our opinion made clear that the authority of the Department of Housing and Urban Development
(HUD) extends beyond the Chicago city limits, see Gautreaux, 425 U. S., at 298-299, n. 14, and that HUD's own administrative practice treated the Chicago metropolitan area
as an undifferentiated whole, id., at 299. Thus, "[t]he relevant geographic area for purposes of the respondents' housing options is the Chicago housing market, not the Chicago
city limits." Ibid. Because the relevant district is the
greater metropolitan area, drawing the remedial line at the
city limits would be "arbitrary and mechanical." Id., at 300.

Justice Souter, post, at 169-170, makes much of how
HUD phrased the question presented: whether it is appropriate to grant " `inter-district relief for discrimination in
public housing in the absence of a finding of an inter-district
violation.' " Gautreaux, supra, at 292. HUD obviously
had an interest in phrasing the question thus, since doing so

107Cite as: 515 U. S. 70 (1995)
O'Connor, J., concurring
emphasizes the alleged deviation from Milliken I. But theCourt was free to reject HUD's characterization of the relevant district, which it did:

"The housing market area `usually extends beyond the
city limits' and in the larger markets `may extend intoseveral adjoining counties.' . . . An order against HUD

and CHA regulating their conduct in the greater metro-politan area will do no more than take into account
HUD's expert determination of the area relevant to therespondents' housing opportunities and will thus be
wholly commensurate with `the nature and extent of the
constitutional violation.' " 425 U. S., at 299-300 (quot-ing

Milliken I, supra, at 744).

In light of this explicit holding, any suggestion that
Gautreaux dispensed with the predicates of Milliken I for
interdistrict relief rings hollow.This distinction notwithstanding, the dissent emphasizes a

footnote in Gautreaux, in which we reversed the finding bythe Court of Appeals that "either an interdistrict violation
or an interdistrict segregative effect may have been pres-ent," 425 U. S., at 294, n. 11, and argues that implicit in that
holding is a suggestion that district lines may be ignoredeven absent a showing of interdistrict segregative effects,
post, at 173. But no footnote is an island, entire of itself,
and our statement in footnote 11 must be read in context.As explained above, we rejected the petitioner's categorical

suggestion that "court-ordered metropolitan area relief inthis case would be impermissible as a matter of law," 425
U. S., at 305. But the Court of Appeals had gone too far the
other way, suggesting that the District Court had to consider
metropolitan area relief because the conditions of Milliken
I--i. e., interdistrict violation or significant interdistrict segregative effects--had been established as a factual matter.
We reversed these ill-advised findings by the appellate court
in order to preserve to the District Court its proper role,

acknowledged by the dissent, post, at 173-174, n. 8, of findingthe necessary facts and exercising its discretion accordingly.

Indeed, in footnote 11 itself, we repeated the requirement ofa "significant segregative effect in another district,"

Milliken
I, 418 U. S., at 745, and held that the Court of Appeals' "unsupported speculation falls far short of the demonstration"required,

Gautreaux, supra, at 295, n. 11. There would have
been little need to overrule the Court of Appeals expresslyon these factual matters if they were indeed irrelevant.

It is this reading of Hills v. Gautreaux--as an affirmationof, not a deviation from,

Milliken I--that the Court of Appeals itself adopted in an earlier phase of this litigation:
"Milliken and Hills make clear that we may grant interdistrict relief only to remedy a constitutional violation by the
SSD [suburban school district], or to remedy an interdistrict
effect in the SSD caused by a constitutional violation in
KCMSD." Jenkins v. Missouri, 807 F. 2d 657, 672 (CA8
1986) (en banc). Perhaps Gautreaux was "mentioned only
briefly" by the respondents, post, at 174, because the case
may actually lend support to the State's argument.

Absent Gautreaux, the dissent hangs on the semantic distinction that "the District Court did not mean by an `intradistrict violation' what the Court apparently means by it
today. The District Court meant that the violation within
the KCMSD had not led to segregation outside of it, and that
no other school districts had played a part in the violation.
It did not mean that the violation had not produced effects
of any sort beyond the district." Post, at 159. The relevant
inquiry under Milliken I and Gautreaux, however, is not
whether the intradistrict violation "produced effects of any
sort beyond the district," but rather whether such violation
caused "significant segregative effects" across district
boundaries, Milliken I, supra, at 745. When the Court
of Appeals affirmed the District Court's initial remedial
order, it specifically stated that the District Court "dealt not
only with the issue of whether the SSDs [suburban school

O'Connor, J., concurring
districts] were constitutional violators but also whetherthere were significant interdistrict segregative effects. . . .

When it did so, it made specific findings that negate currentsignificant interdistrict effects, and concluded that the requirements of Milliken had not been met." Jenkins v.
Missouri, 807 F. 2d, at 672. This holding is unambiguous.Neither the legal responsibility for nor the causal effects

of KCMSD's racial segregation transgressed its boundaries,and absent such interdistrict violation or segregative effects,
Milliken and Gautreaux do not permit a regional remedialplan.

Justice Souter, however, would introduce a different
level of ambiguity, arguing that the District Court took a
limited view of what effects are segregative: "[W]hile white
flight would have produced significant effects in other school
districts, in the form of greatly increased numbers of white
students, those effects would not have been segregative beyond the KCMSD, as the departing students were absorbed
into wholly unitary systems." Post, at 164. Even if accurate, this characterization of the District Court's findings
would be of little significance as to its authority to order
interdistrict relief. Such remedy is appropriate only "to
eliminate the interdistrict segregation directly caused by the
constitutional violation," Milliken I, supra, at 745. Whatever effects KCMSD's constitutional violation may be ventured to have had on the surrounding districts, those effects
would justify interdistrict relief only if they were "segregative beyond the KCMSD."

School desegregation remedies are intended, "as all remedies are, to restore the victims of discriminatory conduct to
the position they would have occupied in the absence of such
conduct." Milliken I, 418 U. S., at 746. In the paradigmatic case of an interdistrict violation, where district boundaries are drawn on the basis of race, a regional remedy is
appropriate to ensure integration across district lines. So,
too, where surrounding districts contribute to the constitu515us1$67j 08-25-98 19:18:23 PAGES OPINPGT

O'Connor, J., concurring
tional violation by affirmative acts intended to segregate theraces--

e. g., where those districts "arrang[e] for white students residing in the Detroit District to attend schools inOakland and Macomb Counties,"

id., at 746-747. Milliken
I of course permits interdistrict remedies in these instances
of interdistrict violations. Beyond that, interdistrict reme-dies are also proper where "there has been a constitutional

violation within one district that produces a significant seg-regative effect in another district."

Id., at 745. Such segregative effect may be present where a predominantly blackdistrict accepts black children from adjacent districts, see

id., at 750, or perhaps even where the fact of intradistrict segregation actually causes whites to flee the district,
cf. Gautreaux, 425 U. S., at 295, n. 11, for example, to avoid
discriminatorily underfunded schools--and such actions
produce regional segregation along district lines. In those
cases, where a purely intradistrict violation has caused a significant interdistrict segregative effect, certain interdistrict
remedies may be appropriate. Where, however, the segregative effects of a district's constitutional violation are contained within that district's boundaries, there is no justification for a remedy that is interdistrict in nature and scope.

Here, where the District Court found that KCMSD
students attended schools separated by their race and that
facilities have "literally rotted," Jenkins v. Missouri, 672
F. Supp. 400, 411 (WD Mo. 1987), it of course should order
restorations and remedies that would place previously segregated black KCMSD students at par with their white
KCMSD counterparts. The District Court went further,
however, and ordered certain improvements to KCMSD as a
whole, including schools that were not previously segregated; these district-wide remedies may also be justified (the
State does not argue the point here) in light of the finding
that segregation caused "a system wide reduction in student
achievement in the schools of the KCMSD," Jenkins v. Missouri, 639 F. Supp. 19, 24 (WD Mo. 1985). Such remedies

O'Connor, J., concurring
obviously may benefit some who did not suffer under--and,indeed, may have even profited from--past segregation.

There is no categorical constitutional prohibition on nonvic-tims enjoying the collateral, incidental benefits of a remedial
plan designed "to restore the victims of discriminatory conduct to the position they would have occupied in the absenceof such conduct."

Milliken I, 418 U. S., at 746. Thus, if
restoring KCMSD to unitary status would attract whitesinto the school district, such a reversal of the white exodus

would be of no legal consequence.What the District Court did in this case, however, and how
it transgressed the constitutional bounds of its remedial powers, was to make desegregative attractiveness the underlying goal of its remedy for the specific purpose of reversing
the trend of white flight. However troubling that trend may
be, remedying it is within the District Court's authority only
if it is "directly caused by the constitutional violation." Id.,
at 745. The Court and the dissent attempt to reconcile the
different statements by the lower courts as to whether white
flight was caused by segregation or desegregation. See
ante, at 94-96; post, at 161-164. One fact, however, is uncontroverted. When the District Court found that KCMSD
was racially segregated, the constitutional violation from
which all remedies flow in this case, it also found that there
was neither an interdistrict violation nor significant interdistrict segregative effects. See Jenkins v. Missouri, 807
F. 2d, at 672; ante, at 96. Whether the white exodus that
has resulted in a school district that is 68% black was caused
by the District Court's remedial orders or by natural, if unfortunate, demographic forces, we have it directly from the
District Court that the segregative effects of KCMSD's
constitutional violation did not transcend its geographical
boundaries. In light of that finding, the District Court cannot order remedies seeking to rectify regional demographic
trends that go beyond the nature and scope of the constitutional violation.

This case, like other school desegregation litigation, is con-cerned with "the elimination of the discrimination inherent

in the dual school systems, not with myriad factors of humanexistence which can cause discrimination in a multitude of
ways on racial, religious, or ethnic grounds." Swann v.
Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed., 402 U. S., at 22. Thosemyriad factors are not readily corrected by judicial intervention, but are best addressed by the representative branches;time and again, we have recognized the ample authority legislatures possess to combat racial injustice, see, e. g., Wisconsin v. Mitchell, 508 U. S. 476, 487-488 (1993); Jones v. Alfred

personal right to equal protection of the laws has not been
infringed. Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469, 493-
494 (1989) (plurality opinion). But it is not true that strict
scrutiny is "strict in theory, but fatal in fact," Fullilove v.
Klutznick, 448 U. S. 448, 519 (1980) (Marshall, J., concurring
in judgment); cf. post, at 121 (Thomas, J., concurring). It is
only by applying strict scrutiny that we can distinguish between unconstitutional discrimination and narrowly tailored
remedial programs that legislatures may enact to further the
compelling governmental interest in redressing the effects
of past discrimination.

Courts, however, are different. The necessary restrictions on our jurisdiction and authority contained in Article
III of the Constitution limit the judiciary's institutional capacity to prescribe palliatives for societal ills. The unfortunate fact of racial imbalance and bias in our society, however
pervasive or invidious, does not admit of judicial intervention
absent a constitutional violation. Thus, even though the
Civil War Amendments altered the balance of authority between federal and state legislatures, see Ex parte Virginia,

100 U. S. 339, 345 (1880), Justice Thomas cogently observesthat "what the federal courts cannot do at the federal level

they cannot do against the States; in either case, Article IIIcourts are constrained by the inherent constitutional limitations on their powers." Post, at 132. Unlike Congress,
which enjoys " `discretion in determining whether and whatlegislation is needed to secure the guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment,' " Croson, supra, at 490 (quoting Katzenbach v. Morgan, supra, at 651), federal courts have no
comparable license and must always observe their limitedjudicial role. Indeed, in the school desegregation context,

federal courts are specifically admonished to "take into account the interests of state and local authorities in managing
their own affairs," Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U. S. 267, 281
(1977) (Milliken II), in light of the intrusion into the area of
education, "where States historically have been sovereign,"
United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, 564 (1995), and "to
which States lay claim by right of history and expertise," id.,
at 583 (Kennedy, J., concurring).

In this case, it may be the "myriad factors of human existence," Swann, supra, at 22, that have prompted the white
exodus from KCMSD, and the District Court cannot justify
its transgression of the above constitutional principles simply by invoking desegregative attractiveness. The Court
today discusses desegregative attractiveness only insofar as
it supports the salary increase order under review, see ante,
at 84, 89-90, and properly refrains from addressing the propriety of all the remedies that the District Court has ordered, revised, and extended in the 18-year history of this
case. These remedies may also be improper to the extent
that they serve the same goals of desegregative attractiveness and suburban comparability that we hold today to be
impermissible, and, conversely, the District Court may be
able to justify some remedies without reliance on these goals.
But these are questions that the Court rightly leaves to be
answered on remand. For now, it is enough to affirm the

principle that "the nature of the desegregation remedy is tobe determined by the nature and scope of the constitutional

violation." Milliken II, supra, at 280.For these reasons, I join the opinion of the Court.

Justice Thomas, concurring.
It never ceases to amaze me that the courts are so willingto assume that anything that is predominantly black must be

inferior. Instead of focusing on remedying the harm doneto those black schoolchildren injured by segregation, the District Court here sought to convert the Kansas City, Missouri,School District (KCMSD) into a "magnet district" that would
reverse the "white flight" caused by desegregation. In thisrespect, I join the Court's decision concerning the two remedial issues presented for review. I write separately, how-ever, to add a few thoughts with respect to the overall course
of this litigation. In order to evaluate the scope of the rem-edy, we must understand the scope of the constitutional violation and the nature of the remedial powers of the federalcourts.

Two threads in our jurisprudence have produced this unfortunate situation, in which a District Court has taken itupon itself to experiment with the education of the KCMSD's

black youth. First, the court has read our cases to supportthe theory that black students suffer an unspecified psychological harm from segregation that retards their mental andeducational development. This approach not only relies
upon questionable social science research rather than consti-tutional principle, but it also rests on an assumption of black
inferiority. Second, we have permitted the federal courts to
exercise virtually unlimited equitable powers to remedy thisalleged constitutional violation. The exercise of this authority has trampled upon principles of federalism and the sepa-ration of powers and has freed courts to pursue other
agendas unrelated to the narrow purpose of precisely reme-dying a constitutional harm.

A

The mere fact that a school is black does not mean that it
is the product of a constitutional violation. A "racial imbalance does not itself establish a violation of the Constitution."
United States v. Fordice, 505 U. S. 717, 745 (1992) (Thomas,
J., concurring). Instead, in order to find unconstitutional
segregation, we require that plaintiffs "prove all of the
essential elements of de jure segregation--that is, stated
simply, a current condition of segregation resulting from intentional state action directed specifically to the [allegedly
segregated] schools." Keyes v. School Dist. No. 1, Denver,
413 U. S. 189, 205-206 (1973) (emphasis added). "[T]he differentiating factor between de jure segregation and so-called
de facto segregation . . . is purpose or intent to segregate."
Id., at 208 (emphasis in original).

In the present case, the District Court inferred a continuing constitutional violation from two primary facts: the existence of de jure segregation in the KCMSD prior to 1954, and
the existence of de facto segregation today. The District
Court found that in 1954, the KCMSD operated 16 segregated schools for black students, and that in 1974 39 schools
in the district were more than 90% black. Desegregation
efforts reduced this figure somewhat, but the District Court
stressed that 24 schools remained "racially isolated," that is,
more than 90% black, in 1983-1984. Jenkins v. Missouri,
593 F. Supp. 1485, 1492-1493 (WD Mo. 1984). For the District Court, it followed that the KCMSD had not dismantled
the dual system entirely. Id., at 1493. The District Court
also concluded that because of the KCMSD's failure to "become integrated on a system-wide basis," the dual system
still exerted "lingering effects" upon KCMSD black students, whose "general attitude of inferiority" produced "low
achievement . . . which ultimately limits employment opportunities and causes poverty." Id., at 1492.

Without more, the District Court's findings could not have
supported a finding of liability against the State. It should
by now be clear that the existence of one-race schools is not
by itself an indication that the State is practicing segregation. See, e. g., Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed.,
402 U. S. 1, 26 (1971); Pasadena City Bd. of Ed. v. Spangler,
427 U. S. 424, 435-437 (1976); Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U. S. 467,
493-494 (1992). The continuing "racial isolation" of schools
after de jure segregation has ended may well reflect voluntary housing choices or other private decisions. Here, for
instance, the demography of the entire KCMSD has changed
considerably since 1954. Though blacks accounted for only
18.9% of KCMSD's enrollment in 1954, by 1983-1984 the
school district was 67.7% black. 593 F. Supp., at 1492, 1495.
That certain schools are overwhelmingly black in a district
that is now more than two-thirds black is hardly a sure sign
of intentional state action.

In search of intentional state action, the District Court
linked the State and the dual school system of 1984 in two
ways. First, the court found that "[i]n the past" the State
had placed its "imprimatur on racial discrimination." As
the court explained, laws from the Jim Crow era created
"an atmosphere in which . . . private white individuals could
justify their bias and prejudice against blacks," with the possible result that private realtors, bankers, and insurers engaged in more discriminatory activities than would otherwise have occurred. Id., at 1503. But the District Court
itself acknowledged that the State's alleged encouragement
of private discrimination was a fairly tenuous basis for finding liability. Ibid. The District Court therefore rested the
State's liability on the simple fact that the State had intentionally created the dual school system before 1954, and had
failed to fulfill "its affirmative duty of disestablishing a dual
school system subsequent to 1954." Id., at 1504. According
to the District Court, the schools whose student bodies were

117Cite as: 515 U. S. 70 (1995)
Thomas, J., concurring
more than 90% black constituted "vestiges" of the prior dejure segregation, which the State and the KCMSD had an

obligation to eliminate. Id., at 1504, 1506. Later, in thecourse of issuing its first "remedial" order, the District Court
added that a "system wide reduction in student achievementin the schools of . . . KCMSD" was also a vestige of the prior
de jure segregation. Jenkins v. Missouri, 639 F. Supp. 19,24 (WD Mo. 1985) (emphasis deleted).

1 In a subsequent

order, the District Court indicated that post-1954 "whiteflight" was another vestige of the pre-1954 segregated system. 1 App. 126.In order for a "vestige" to supply the ground for an exercise of remedial authority, it must be clearly traceable to thedual school system. The "vestiges of segregation that are
the concern of the law in a school case may be subtle andintangible but nonetheless they must be so real that they
have a causal link to the de jure violation being remedied."Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U. S., at 496. District courts must
not confuse the consequences of de jure segregation with theresults of larger social forces or of private decisions. "It is
simply not always the case that demographic forces causing
population change bear any real and substantial relation toa

de jure violation." Ibid.; accord, id., at 501 (Scalia, J.,
concurring); Columbus Bd. of Ed. v. Penick, 443 U. S. 449,512 (1979) (

Rehnquist, J., dissenting); Pasadena City Bd. of
Ed. v. Spangler, supra, at 435-436. As state-enforced seg-regation recedes further into the past, it is more likely that

"these kinds of continuous and massive demographic shifts,"
Freeman, 503 U. S., at 495, will be the real source of racial
imbalance or of poor educational performance in a school dis1 It appears that the low achievement levels were never properly attributed to any discriminatory actions on the part of the State or of KCMSD.
The District Court simply found that the KCMSD's test scores were below
national norms in reading and mathematics. 639 F. Supp., at 25. Without more, these statistics are meaningless.

trict. And as we have emphasized, "[i]t is beyond the authority and beyond the practical ability of the federal courts
to try to counteract" these social changes. Ibid.

When a district court holds the State liable for discrimination almost 30 years after the last official state action, it must
do more than show that there are schools with high black
populations or low test scores. Here, the District Judge did
not make clear how the high black enrollments in certain
schools were fairly traceable to the State of Missouri's actions. I do not doubt that Missouri maintained the despicable system of segregation until 1954. But I question the
District Court's conclusion that because the State had enforced segregation until 1954, its actions, or lack thereof,
proximately caused the "racial isolation" of the predominantly black schools in 1984. In fact, where, as here, the
finding of liability comes so late in the day, I would think it
incumbent upon the District Court to explain how more recent social or demographic phenomena did not cause the
"vestiges." This the District Court did not do.

B
Without a basis in any real finding of intentional government action, the District Court's imposition of liability upon
the State of Missouri improperly rests upon a theory that
racial imbalances are unconstitutional. That is, the court
has "indulged the presumption, often irrebuttable in practice, that a presently observed [racial] imbalance has been
proximately caused by intentional state action during the
prior de jure era." United States v. Fordice, 505 U. S., at
745 (Thomas, J., concurring) (citing Dayton Bd. of Ed. v.
Brinkman, 443 U. S. 526, 537 (1979), and Keyes v. School
Dist. No. 1, 413 U. S., at 211). In effect, the court found
that racial imbalances constituted an ongoing constitutional
violation that continued to inflict harm on black students.

This position appears to rest upon the idea that any schoolthat is black is inferior, and that blacks cannot succeed without the benefit of the company of whites.The District Court's willingness to adopt such stereotypes
stemmed from a misreading of our earliest school desegregation case. In Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483(1954)

(Brown I), the Court noted several psychological and
sociological studies purporting to show that de jure segrega-tion harmed black students by generating "a feeling of inferiority" in them. Seizing upon this passage in Brown I, theDistrict Court asserted that "forced segregation ruins attitudes and is inherently unequal." 593 F. Supp., at 1492.The District Court suggested that this inequality continues
in full force even after the end of de jure segregation:

"The general attitude of inferiority among blacks produces low achievement which ultimately limits employ-ment opportunities and causes poverty. While it may

be true that poverty results in low achievement regardless of race, it is undeniable that most poverty-level families are black. The District stipulated that as of 1977
they had not eliminated all the vestiges of the prior dual
system. The Court finds the inferior education indigenous of the state-compelled dual school system
has lingering effects in the [KCMSD]." Ibid. (citations
omitted).

Thus, the District Court seemed to believe that black students in the KCMSD would continue to receive an "inferior
education" despite the end of de jure segregation, as long as
de facto segregation persisted. As the District Court later
concluded, compensatory educational programs were necessary "as a means of remedying many of the educational problems which go hand in hand with racially isolated minority
student populations." 639 F. Supp., at 25. Such assumptions and any social science research upon which they rely

certainly cannot form the basis upon which we decide mat-ters of constitutional principle.

2

It is clear that the District Court misunderstood the mean-ing of Brown I. Brown I did not say that "racially isolated"

schools were inherently inferior; the harm that it identifiedwas tied purely to

de jure segregation, not de facto segrega-tion. Indeed, Brown I itself did not need to rely upon any

psychological or social-science research in order to announcethe simple, yet fundamental, truth that the government cannot discriminate among its citizens on the basis of race. SeeMcConnell, Originalism and the Desegregation Decisions, 81
Va. L. Rev. 947 (1995). As the Court's unanimous opinionindicated: "[I]n the field of public education the doctrine of
`separate but equal' has no place. Separate educationalfacilities are inherently unequal."

Brown I, supra, at 495.At the heart of this interpretation of the Equal Protection

Clause lies the principle that the government must treat citi2 The studies cited in Brown I have received harsh criticism. See, e. g.,
Yudof, School Desegregation: Legal Realism, Reasoned Elaboration, and
Social Science Research in the Supreme Court, 42 Law & Contemp. Prob.
57, 70 (Autumn 1978); L. Graglia, Disaster by Decree: The Supreme Court
Decisions on Race and the Schools 27-28 (1976). Moreover, there simply
is no conclusive evidence that desegregation either has sparked a permanent jump in the achievement scores of black children, or has remedied
any psychological feelings of inferiority black schoolchildren might have
had. See, e. g., Bradley & Bradley, The Academic Achievement of Black
Students in Desegregated Schools, 47 Rev. Educational Research 399
(1977); N. St. John, School Desegregation: Outcomes for Children (1975);
Epps, The Impact of School Desegregation on Aspirations, Self-Concepts
and Other Aspects of Personality, 39 Law & Contemp. Prob. 300 (Spring
1975). Contra, Crain & Mahard, Desegregation and Black Achievement:

Although the gap between black and white test scores has narrowed over
the past two decades, it appears that this has resulted more from gains in
the socioeconomic status of black families than from desegregation. See
Armor, Why is Black Educational Achievement Rising?, 108 The Public
Interest 65, 77-79 (Summer 1992).

zens as individuals, and not as members of racial, ethnic, orreligious groups. It is for this reason that we must subject

all racial classifications to the strictest of scrutiny, which(aside from two decisions rendered in the midst of wartime,
see Hirabayashi v. United States, 320 U. S. 81 (1943); Korematsu v. United States, 323 U. S. 214 (1944)) has proven auto-matically fatal.

Segregation was not unconstitutional because it mighthave caused psychological feelings of inferiority. Public
school systems that separated blacks and provided them withsuperior educational resources--making blacks "feel" superior to whites sent to lesser schools--would violate the Fourteenth Amendment, whether or not the white students felt
stigmatized, just as do school systems in which the positions
of the races are reversed. Psychological injury or benefit is
irrelevant to the question whether state actors have engaged
in intentional discrimination--the critical inquiry for ascertaining violations of the Equal Protection Clause. The judiciary is fully competent to make independent determinations
concerning the existence of state action without the unnecessary and misleading assistance of the social sciences.

Regardless of the relative quality of the schools, segregation violated the Constitution because the State classified
students based on their race. Of course, segregation additionally harmed black students by relegating them to schools
with substandard facilities and resources. But neutral policies, such as local school assignments, do not offend the Constitution when individual private choices concerning work or
residence produce schools with high black populations. See
Keyes v. School Dist. No. 1, 413 U. S., at 211. The Constitution does not prevent individuals from choosing to live together, to work together, or to send their children to school
together, so long as the State does not interfere with their
choices on the basis of race.

Given that desegregation has not produced the predicted
leaps forward in black educational achievement, there is no

515us1$67n 08-25-98 19:18:23 PAGES OPINPGT

Thomas, J., concurring
reason to think that black students cannot learn as well when
surrounded by members of their own race as when they are
in an integrated environment. Indeed, it may very well be
that what has been true for historically black colleges is true
for black middle and high schools. Despite their origins in
"the shameful history of state-enforced segregation," these
institutions can be " `both a source of pride to blacks who
have attended them and a source of hope to black families
who want the benefits of . . . learning for their children.' "
Fordice, 505 U. S., at 748 (Thomas, J., concurring) (citation
omitted). Because of their "distinctive histories and traditions," ibid., black schools can function as the center and
symbol of black communities, and provide examples of independent black leadership, success, and achievement.

Thus, even if the District Court had been on firmer ground
in identifying a link between the KCMSD's pre-1954 de jure
segregation and the present "racial isolation" of some of the
district's schools, mere de facto segregation (unaccompanied
by discriminatory inequalities in educational resources) does
not constitute a continuing harm after the end of de jure
segregation. "Racial isolation" itself is not a harm; only
state-enforced segregation is. After all, if separation itself
is a harm, and if integration therefore is the only way that
blacks can receive a proper education, then there must be
something inferior about blacks. Under this theory, segregation injures blacks because blacks, when left on their own,
cannot achieve. To my way of thinking, that conclusion is
the result of a jurisprudence based upon a theory of black
inferiority.

This misconception has drawn the courts away from the
important goal in desegregation. The point of the Equal
Protection Clause is not to enforce strict race-mixing, but to
ensure that blacks and whites are treated equally by the
State without regard to their skin color. The lower courts
should not be swayed by the easy answers of social science,

Thomas, J., concurring
nor should they accept the findings, and the assumptions,of sociology and psychology at the price of constitutional

principle. II

We have authorized the district courts to remedy past dejure segregation by reassigning students in order to eliminate or decrease observed racial imbalances, even if pres-ent methods of pupil assignment are facially neutral. See
Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed., 402 U. S. 1(1971);

Green v. School Bd. of New Kent Cty., 391 U. S. 430(1968). The District Court here merely took this approach

to its logical next step. If racial proportions are the goal,then schools must improve their facilities to attract white
students until the district's racial balance is restored to the"right" proportions. Thus, fault for the problem we correct
today lies not only with a twisted theory of racial injuries,but also with our approach to the remedies necessary to
correct racial imbalances.The District Court's unwarranted focus on the psychological harm to blacks and on racial imbalances has been onlyhalf of the tale. Not only did the court subscribe to a theory
of injury that was predicated on black inferiority, it alsomarried this concept of liability to our expansive approach
to remedial powers. We have given the federal courts thefreedom to use any measure necessary to reverse problems--
such as racial isolation or low educational achievement--thathave proven stubbornly resistant to government policies.
We have not permitted constitutional principles such asfederalism or the separation of powers to stand in the way
of our drive to reform the schools. Thus, the District Court
here ordered massive expenditures by local and state author-ities, without congressional or executive authorization and

without any indication that such measures would attractwhites back to KCMSD or raise KCMSD test scores. The
time has come for us to put the genie back in the bottle.

A
The Constitution extends "[t]he judicial Power of theUnited States" to "all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising

under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, andTreaties made . . . under their Authority." Art. III, $$ 1, 2.
I assume for purposes of this case that the remedial author-ity of the federal courts is inherent in the "judicial Power,"
as there is no general equitable remedial power expresslygranted by the Constitution or by statute. As with any inherent judicial power, however, we ought to be reluctant toapprove its aggressive or extravagant use, and instead we
should exercise it in a manner consistent with our historyand traditions. See Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U. S. 32,
63-76 (1991) (Kennedy, J., dissenting); Young v. UnitedStates ex rel. Vuitton et Fils S. A., 481 U. S. 787, 815-825
(1987) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment).Motivated by our worthy desire to eradicate segregation,
however, we have disregarded this principle and given thecourts unprecedented authority to shape a remedy in equity.
Although at times we have invalidated a decree as beyondthe bounds of an equitable remedy, see

Milliken v. Bradley,418 U. S. 717 (1974) (Milliken I), these instances have been

far outnumbered by the expansions in the equity power. In
United States v. Montgomery County Bd. of Ed., 395 U. S.225 (1969), for example, we allowed federal courts to desegregate faculty and staff according to specific mathematicalratios, with the ultimate goal that each school in the system
would have roughly the same proportions of white and blackfaculty. In Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed.,
supra, we permitted federal courts to order busing, to setracial targets for school populations, and to alter attendance
zones. And in Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U. S. 267 (1977)
(Milliken II), we approved the use of remedial or compensa-tory education programs paid for by the State.

In upholding these court-ordered measures, we indicatedthat trial judges had virtually boundless discretion in craft515us1$67n 08-25-98 19:18:23 PAGES OPINPGT

ing remedies once they had identified a constitutional viola-tion. As

Swann put it, "[o]nce a right and a violation have
been shown, the scope of a district court's equitable powersto remedy past wrongs is broad, for breadth and flexibility

are inherent in equitable remedies." 402 U. S., at 15. We
did say that "the nature of the violation determines thescope of the remedy,"

id., at 16, but our very next sentence
signaled how weak that limitation was: "In default by theschool authorities of their obligation to proffer acceptable

remedies, a district court has broad power to fashion aremedy that will assure a unitary school system,"

ibid.
It is perhaps understandable that we permitted the lower
courts to exercise such sweeping powers. Although we had
authorized the federal courts to work toward "a system of
determining admission to the public schools on a nonracial
basis" in Brown v. Board of Education, 349 U. S. 294, 300-
301 (1955) (Brown II), resistance to Brown I produced little
desegregation by the time we decided Green v. School Bd.
of New Kent Cty., supra. Our impatience with the pace of
desegregation and with the lack of a good-faith effort on the
part of school boards led us to approve such extraordinary
remedial measures. But such powers should have been temporary and used only to overcome the widespread resistance
to the dictates of the Constitution. The judicial overreaching we see before us today perhaps is the price we now pay
for our approval of such extraordinary remedies in the past.

Our prior decision in this litigation suggested that we
would approve the continued use of these expansive powers
even when the need for their exercise had disappeared. In
Missouri v. Jenkins, 495 U. S. 33 (1990) (Jenkins II), the District Court in this litigation had ordered an increase in local
property taxes in order to fund its capital improvements
plan. KCMSD, which had been ordered by the Court to
finance 25% of the plan, could not pay its share due to state
constitutional and statutory provisions placing a cap on property taxes. Id., at 38, 41. Although we held that principles

Thomas, J., concurring
of comity barred the District Court from imposing the taxincrease itself (except as a last resort), we also concluded

that the court could order KCMSD to raise taxes, and couldenjoin the state laws preventing KCMSD from doing so.
With little analysis, we held that "a court order directing alocal government body to levy its own taxes is plainly a judicial act within the power of a federal court." Id., at 55.Our willingness to unleash the federal equitable power has
reached areas beyond school desegregation. Federal courtshave used "structural injunctions," as they are known, not
only to supervise our Nation's schools, but also to manageprisons, see

Hutto v. Finney, 437 U. S. 678 (1978), mentalhospitals,
Thomas S. v. Flaherty, 902 F. 2d 250 (CA4), cert.denied, 498 U. S. 951 (1990), and public housing, Hills v. Gautreaux, 425 U. S. 284 (1976). See generally D. Horowitz, TheCourts and Social Policy 4-9 (1977). Judges have directed
or managed the reconstruction of entire institutions andbureaucracies, with little regard for the inherent limitations
on their authority. B

Such extravagant uses of judicial power are at odds withthe history and tradition of the equity power and the Framers' design. The available historical records suggest thatthe Framers did not intend federal equitable remedies to
reach as broadly as we have permitted. Anticipating thegrowth of our modern doctrine, the Anti-Federalists criticized the Constitution because it might be read to grant
broad equitable powers to the federal courts. In response,the defenders of the Constitution "sold" the new framework

of government to the public by espousing a narrower interpretation of the equity power. When an attack on the Con-stitution is followed by an open Federalist effort to narrow

the provision, the appropriate conclusion is that the draftersand ratifiers of the Constitution approved the more limited
construction offered in response. See McIntyre v. Ohio

The rise of the English equity courts as an alternative to
the rigors of the common law, and the battle between the
courts of equity and the courts of common law, is by now a
familiar tale. See T. Plucknett, A Concise History of the
Common Law 191-198, 673-694 (5th ed. 1956). By the middle of the 18th century, equity had developed into a precise
legal system encompassing certain recognized categories of
cases, such as those involving special property forms (trusts)
or those in which the common law did not provide relief
(fraud, forgery, or mistake). See 5 W. Holdsworth, History
of English Law 300-338 (1927); S. Milsom, Historical Foundations of the Common Law 85-87 (1969); J. Baker, An Introduction to English Legal History 93-95 (2d ed. 1979). In
this fixed system, each of these specific actions then called
for a specific equitable remedy.

Blackstone described the principal differences between
courts of law and courts of equity as lying only in the "modes
of administering justice,"--"in the mode of proof, the mode
of trial, and the mode of relief." 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 436 (1768). As to the last, the
English jurist noted that courts of equity held a concurrent
jurisdiction when there is a "want of a more specific remedy,
than can be obtained in the courts of law." Id., at 438.
Throughout his discussion, Blackstone emphasized that
courts of equity must be governed by rules and precedents
no less than the courts of law. "[I]f a court of equity were
still at sea, and floated upon the occasional opinion which the
judge who happened to preside might entertain of conscience
in every particular case, the inconvenience that would arise
from this uncertainty, would be a worse evil than any hardship that could follow from rules too strict and inflexible."
Id., at 440. If their remedial discretion had not been cabined, Blackstone warned, equity courts would have under515US1 Unit: $U67 [05-24-00 19:50:29] PAGES PGT: OPIN

mined the rule of law and produced arbitrary government."[The judiciary's] powers would have become too arbitrary

to have been endured in a country like this, which boasts ofbeing governed in all respects by law and not by will."
Ibid. (footnote omitted); see also 1 id., at 61-62.3So cautioned, the Framers approached equity with suspicion. As Thomas Jefferson put it: "Relieve the judges fromthe rigour of text law, and permit them, with pretorian discretion, to wander into it's equity, and the whole legal systembecomes incertain." 9 Papers of Thomas Jefferson 71 (J.
Boyd ed. 1954). Suspicion of judicial discretion led to criti-cism of Article III during the ratification of the Constitution.
Anti-Federalists attacked the Constitution's extension of thefederal judicial power to "Cases, in Law and Equity," arising
under the Constitution and federal statutes. According tothe Anti-Federalists, the reference to equity granted federal
judges excessive discretion to deviate from the requirementsof the law. Said the "Federal Farmer," "by thus joining the
word equity with the word law, if we mean any thing, weseem to mean to give the judge a discretionary power." Federal Farmer No. 15, Jan. 18, 1788, in 2 The Complete Anti-Federalist 322 (H. Storing ed. 1981) (hereinafter Storing).
He hoped that the Constitution's mention of equity jurisdic-tion was not "intended to lodge an arbitrary power or discretion in the judges, to decide as their conscience, their opin-ions, their caprice, or their politics might dictate."

Id., at322-323.
4 Another Anti-Federalist, Brutus, argued that the

3 As Blackstone wrote: "[A] set of great and eminent lawyers . . . have
by degrees erected the system of relief administered by a court of equity
into a regular science, which cannot be attained without study and experience, any more than the science of law: but from which, when understood,
it may be known what remedy a suitor is entitled to expect, and by what
mode of suit, as readily and with as much precision, in a court of equity
as in a court of law." 3 Blackstone, at 440-441.

4 The Federal Farmer particularly feared the combination of equity and

law in the same federal courts: "It is a very dangerous thing to vest in
the same judge power to decide on the law, and also general powers in

equity power would allow federal courts to "explain the con-stitution according to the reasoning spirit of it, without being

confined to the words or letter." Brutus No. 11, Jan. 31,1788,

id., at 419. This, predicted Brutus, would result in the
growth of federal power and the "entire subversion of the
legislative, executive and judicial powers of the individualstates."

Id., at 420. See G. McDowell, Equity and the Constitution 43-44 (1982).These criticisms provoked a Federalist response that explained the meaning of Article III's words. Answering theAnti-Federalist challenge in The Federalist Papers, Alexander Hamilton described the narrow role that the federal judi-cial power would play. Initially, Hamilton conceded that the
federal courts would have some freedom in interpreting the
laws and that federal judges would have lifetime tenure.The Federalist No. 78, p. 528 (J. Cooke ed. 1961). Nonetheless, Hamilton argued (as Blackstone had in describing the
English equity courts) that rules and established practices
would limit and control the judicial power: "To avoid an arbitrary discretion in the courts, it is indispensable that they
should be bound down by strict rules and precedents, which
serve to define and point out their duty in every particular
case that comes before them." Id., at 529. Cf. 1 J. Story,
Commentaries on Equity Jurisprudence $$ 18-20, pp. 15-17
(I. Redfield 9th ed. 1866). Hamilton emphasized that "[t]he
great and primary use of a court of equity is to give relief
in extraordinary cases," and that "the principles by which
that relief is governed are now reduced to a regular system."
The Federalist No. 83, at 569, and n.

equity; for if the law restrain him, he is only to step into his shoes of
equity, and give what judgment his reason or opinion may dictate; we have
no precedents in this country, as yet, to regulate the divisions in equity as
in Great Britain; equity, therefore, in the supreme court for many years
will be mere discretion." Federal Farmer No. 3, Oct. 10, 1787, in 2 Storing 244. In such a system, the Anti-Federalist writer concluded, there
would not be "a spark of freedom" to be found. Ibid.

130 MISSOURI v. JENKINS

Thomas, J., concurring
In response to Anti-Federalist concerns that equity wouldpermit federal judges an unchecked discretion, Hamilton explicitly relied upon the precise nature of the equity systemthat prevailed in England and had been transplanted in
America. Equity jurisdiction was necessary, Hamilton argued, because litigation "between individuals" often wouldcontain claims of "

fraud, accident, trust or hardship, which
would render the matter an object of equitable, rather thanof legal jurisdiction."

Id., No. 80, at 539. "In such cases,"
Hamilton concluded, "where foreigners were concerned oneither side, it would be impossible for the federal judicatories

to do justice without an equitable, as well as a legal jurisdiction." Id., at 540. Thus, Hamilton sought to narrow the
expansive Anti-Federalist reading of inherent judicial equity
power by demonstrating that the defined nature of the English and colonial equity system--with its specified claims and
remedies--would continue to exist under the federal judiciary. In line with the prevailing understanding of equity
at the time, Hamilton described Article III "equity" as a jurisdiction over certain types of cases rather than as a broad
remedial power. Hamilton merely repeated the well-known
principle that equity would be controlled no less by rules and
practices than was the common law.

In light of this historical evidence, it should come as no
surprise that there is no early record of the exercise of broad
remedial powers. Certainly there were no "structural injunctions" issued by the federal courts, nor were there any
examples of continuing judicial supervision and management
of governmental institutions. Such exercises of judicial
power would have appeared to violate principles of state sovereignty and of the separation of powers as late in the day
as the turn of the century. "Born out of the desegregation
litigation in the 1950's and 1960's, suits for affirmative injunctions were virtually unknown when the Court decided Ex

129, 162 (1987) (footnotes omitted). Indeed, it appears thatthe Framers continued to follow English equity practice well

after the Ratification. See, e. g., Robinson v. Campbell, 3Wheat. 212, 221-223 (1818). At the very least, given the
Federalists' public explanation during the ratification of thefederal equity power, we should exercise the power to impose equitable remedies only sparingly, subject to clear rulesguiding its use.

C
Two clear restraints on the use of the equity power--fed-eralism and the separation of powers--derive from the very

form of our Government. Federal courts should pause be-fore using their inherent equitable powers to intrude into
the proper sphere of the States. We have long recognizedthat education is primarily a concern of local authorities.
"[L]ocal autonomy of school districts is a vital national tradi-tion."

(1995) (Kennedy, J., concurring); Milliken I, 418 U. S., at741-742; San Antonio Independent School Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U. S. 1, 50 (1973); ante, at 113 (O'Connor, J., con-curring). A structural reform decree eviscerates a State's
discretionary authority over its own program and budgetsand forces state officials to reallocate state resources and
funds to the desegregation plan at the expense of other citi-zens, other government programs, and other institutions not
represented in court. See Dwyer, supra, at 163. Whendistrict courts seize complete control over the schools, they
strip state and local governments of one of their most im-portant governmental responsibilities, and thus deny their
existence as independent governmental entities.Federal courts do not possess the capabilities of state and
local governments in addressing difficult educational prob-lems. State and local school officials not only bear the responsibility for educational decisions, they also are betterequipped than a single federal judge to make the day-to-day

Wright v. Council of Emporia, 407 U. S. 451, 477-478 (1972)(Burger, C. J., dissenting).

5 Federal courts simply cannot

gather sufficient information to render an effective decree,have limited resources to induce compliance, and cannot seek

political and public support for their remedies. See gener-ally P. Schuck, Suing Government 150-181 (1983). When we
presume to have the institutional ability to set effective edu-cational, budgetary, or administrative policy, we transform
the least dangerous branch into the most dangerous one.The separation of powers imposes additional restraints on
the judiciary's exercise of its remedial powers. To be sure,this is not a case of one branch of Government encroaching
on the prerogatives of another, but rather of the power ofthe Federal Government over the States. Nonetheless,
what the federal courts cannot do at the federal level theycannot do against the States; in either case, Article III courts
are constrained by the inherent constitutional limitations ontheir powers. There simply are certain things that courts,
in order to remain courts, cannot and should not do. There

5 Certain aspects of this desegregation plan--for example, compensatory
educational programs and orders that the State pay for half of the costs--
come perilously close to abrogating the State's Eleventh Amendment immunity from federal money damages awards. See Edelman v. Jordan,
415 U. S. 651, 677 (1974) ("[A] federal court's remedial power . . . may not
include a retroactive award which requires the payment of funds from the
state treasury"). Although we held in Milliken II, 433 U. S. 267 (1977),
that such remedies did not run afoul of the Eleventh Amendment, id., at
290, it is difficult to see how they constitute purely prospective relief
rather than retrospective compensation. See P. Bator, D. Meltzer, P.
Mishkin, & D. Shapiro, Hart and Wechsler's The Federal Courts and the
Federal System 1191-1192 (3d ed. 1988). Of course, the state treasury
inevitably must fund a State's compliance with injunctions commanding
prospective relief, see Edelman, supra, at 668, but that does not require
a State to supply money to comply with orders that have a backwardlooking, compensatory purpose.

is no difference between courts running school systems or
prisons and courts running Executive Branch agencies.

In this case, not only did the District Court exercise the
legislative power to tax, it also engaged in budgeting,
staffing, and educational decisions, in judgments about the
location and esthetic quality of the schools, and in administrative oversight and monitoring. These functions involve a
legislative or executive, rather than a judicial, power. See
generally Jenkins II, 495 U. S., at 65-81 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); Nagel, Separation of Powers and the Scope of Federal Equitable Remedies,
30 Stan. L. Rev. 661 (1978). As Alexander Hamilton explained the limited authority of the federal courts: "The
courts must declare the sense of the law; and if they should
be disposed to exercise WILL instead of JUDGMENT, the
consequence would equally be the substitution of their pleasure to that of the legislative body." The Federalist No. 78,
at 526. Federal judges cannot make the fundamentally political decisions as to which priorities are to receive funds
and staff, which educational goals are to be sought, and
which values are to be taught. When federal judges undertake such local, day-to-day tasks, they detract from the independence and dignity of the federal courts and intrude into
areas in which they have little expertise. Cf. Mishkin, Federal Courts as State Reformers, 35 Wash. & Lee L. Rev.
949 (1978).

It is perhaps not surprising that broad equitable powers
have crept into our jurisprudence, for they vest judges with
the discretion to escape the constraints and dictates of the
law and legal rules. But I believe that we must impose
more precise standards and guidelines on the federal equitable power, not only to restore predictability to the law and
reduce judicial discretion, but also to ensure that constitutional remedies are actually targeted toward those who have
been injured.

The dissent's approval of the District Court's treatment ofsalary increases is typical of this Court's failure to place limits on the equitable remedial power. The dissent frames theinquiry thus: "The only issue, then, is whether the salary
increases ordered by the District Court have been reason-ably related to achieving" the goal of remedying a systemwide reduction in student achievement, "keeping in mind thebroad discretion enjoyed by the District Court in exercising
its equitable powers." Post, at 155. In response to itsquestion, the dissent concludes that "it is difficult to see how
the District Court abused its discretion" in either the 1992or 1993 orders, ibid., and characterizes the lower court's
orders as "beyond reproach," post, at 158. When the stand-ard of review is as vague as whether "federal-court decrees
. . . directly address and relate to the constitutional viola-tion,"

Milliken II, 433 U. S., at 281-282, it is difficult to everfind a remedial order "unreasonable." Such criteria provide

district courts with little guidance, and provide appellatecourts few principles with which to review trial court decisions. If the standard reduces to what one believes is a"fair" remedy, or what vaguely appears to be a good "fit"
between violation and remedy, then there is little hope ofimposing the constraints on the equity power that the Framers envisioned and that our constitutional system requires.Contrary to the dissent's conclusion, the District Court's
remedial orders are in tension with two commonsense prin-ciples. First, the District Court retained jurisdiction over
the implementation and modification of the remedial decree,instead of terminating its involvement after issuing its remedy. Although briefly mentioned in Brown II as a tempo-rary measure to overcome local resistance to desegregation,
349 U. S., at 301 ("During this period of transition, the courtswill retain jurisdiction"), this concept of continuing judicial
involvement has permitted the District Courts to revisetheir remedies constantly in order to reach some broad, ab515us1$67n 08-25-98 19:18:23 PAGES OPINPGT

stract, and often elusive goal. Not only does this approachdeprive the parties of finality and a clear understanding of

their responsibilities, but it also tends to inject the judiciaryinto the day-to-day management of institutions and local policies--a function that lies outside of our Article III compe-tence. Cf. Fuller, The Forms and Limits of Adjudication, 92
Harv. L. Rev. 353 (1978).Much of the District Court's overreaching in this case occurred because it employed this hit-or-miss method to shape,and reshape, its remedial decree.

6 Using its authority of

continuing jurisdiction, the court pursued its goal of decreas-ing "racial isolation" regardless of the cost or of the difficulties of engineering demographic changes. Wherever possi-ble, district courts should focus their remedial discretion on
devising and implementing a unified remedy in a single de-cree. This method would still provide the lower courts with

6 First, the District Court set out to achieve some unspecified levels of
racial balance in the KCMSD schools and to raise the test scores of the
school districts as a whole. 639 F. Supp. 19, 24, 38 (WD Mo. 1985). In
order to achieve that goal, the court ordered quality education programs
to address the "system wide reduction in student achievement" caused by
segregation, even though the court never specified how or to what extent
the dual system had actually done so. Id., at 46-51. After the State had
spent $220 million and KCMSD had achieved a AAA rating, see ante, at
75-76, the District Court decided that even further measures were needed.
In 1986, it ordered a massive magnet school and capital improvement plan
to attract whites into KCMSD. 1 App. 130-193. In 1987, the District
Court decided that KCMSD needed better instructional staff and ordered
salary assistance for teachers. Ante, at 78. In 1992, the District Court
found that KCMSD was having trouble attracting faculty and staff, and
ordered a round of salary increases for virtually all employees. Ante, at
80. Every year the District Court holds a proceeding to review budget
proposals and educational policies for KCMSD, and it has formed a "desegregation monitoring committee" to assess the implementation of its decrees. One need only review the District Court's first remedial order in
1984 to comprehend the level of detail with which it has made decisions
concerning construction, facilities, staffing, and educational policy. 639

substantial flexibility to tailor a remedy to fit a violation, andcourts could employ their contempt power to ensure compliance. To ensure that they do not overstep the boundariesof their Article III powers, however, district courts should
refrain from exercising their authority in a manner that supplants the proper sphere reserved to the political branches,who have a coordinate duty to enforce the Constitution's dictates, and to the States, whose authority over schools wehave long sought to preserve. Only by remaining aware of
the limited nature of its remedial powers, and by giving therespect due to other governmental authorities, can the judiciary ensure that its desire to do good will not tempt it into
abandoning its limited role in our constitutional Government.

Second, the District Court failed to target its equitable
remedies in this case specifically to cure the harm suffered
by the victims of segregation. Of course, the initial and
most important aspect of any remedy will be to eliminate
any invidious racial distinctions in matters such as student
assignments, transportation, staff, resource allocation, and
activities. This element of most desegregation decrees is
fairly straightforward and has not produced many examples
of overreaching by the district courts. It is the "compensatory" ingredient in many desegregation plans that has
produced many of the difficulties in the case before us.

Having found that segregation "has caused a system wide
reduction in student achievement in the schools of the
KCMSD," 639 F. Supp., at 24, the District Court ordered
the series of magnet school plans, educational programs, and
capital improvements that the Court criticizes today because
of their interdistrict nature. In ordering these programs,
the District Court exceeded its authority by benefiting those
who were not victims of discriminatory conduct. KCMSD
as a whole may have experienced reduced achievement levels, but raising the test scores of the entire district is a goal
that is not sufficiently tailored to restoring the victims of
segregation to the position they would have occupied absent

discrimination. A school district cannot be discriminatedagainst on the basis of its race, because a school district has

no race. It goes without saying that only individuals cansuffer from discrimination, and only individuals can receive
the remedy.Of course, a district court may see fit to order necessary
remedies that have the side effect of benefiting those whowere not victims of segregation. But the court cannot order
broad remedies that indiscriminately benefit a school districtas a whole, rather than the individual students who suffered
from discrimination. Not only do such remedies tend to in-dicate "efforts to achieve broader purposes lying beyond" the
scope of the violation, Swann, 402 U. S., at 22, but they alsoforce state and local governments to work toward the benefit
of those who have suffered no harm from their actions.To ensure that district courts do not embark on such broad
initiatives in the future, we should demand that remedial de-crees be more precisely designed to benefit only those who
have been victims of segregation. Race-conscious remediesfor discrimination not only must serve a compelling governmental interest (which is met in desegregation cases), butalso must be narrowly tailored to further that interest. See
Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469, 509-510 (1989)(plurality opinion). In the absence of special circumstances,
the remedy for de jure segregation ordinarily should not in-clude educational programs for students who were not in
school (or were even alive) during the period of segregation.Although I do not doubt that all KCMSD students benefit
from many of the initiatives ordered by the court below, it isfor the democratically accountable state and local officials to
decide whether they are to be made available even to thosewho were never harmed by segregation.

education. But the federal courts also should avoid usingracial equality as a pretext for solving social problems that

do not violate the Constitution. It seems apparent to methat the District Court undertook the worthy task of providing a quality education to the children of KCMSD. As far
as I can tell, however, the District Court sought to bringnew funds and facilities into the KCMSD by finding a constitutional violation on the part of the State where there wasnone. Federal courts should not lightly assume that States
have caused "racial isolation" in 1984 by maintaining a segre-gated school system in 1954. We must forever put aside the
notion that simply because a school district today is black, itmust be educationally inferior.

Even if segregation were present, we must remember that
a deserving end does not justify all possible means. The
desire to reform a school district, or any other institution,
cannot so captivate the judiciary that it forgets its constitutionally mandated role. Usurpation of the traditionally local
control over education not only takes the judiciary beyond
its proper sphere, it also deprives the States and their
elected officials of their constitutional powers. At some
point, we must recognize that the judiciary is not omniscient,
and that all problems do not require a remedy of constitutional proportions.

Justice Souter, with whom Justice Stevens, Justice
Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer join, dissenting.

The Court's process of orderly adjudication has broken
down in this case. The Court disposes of challenges to only
two of the District Court's many discrete remedial orders by
declaring that the District Court erroneously provided an
interdistrict remedy for an intradistrict violation. In doing
so, it resolves a foundational issue going to one element of
the District Court's decree that we did not accept for review
in this case, that we need not reach in order to answer the
questions that we did accept for review, and that we specifi515us1$67m 08-25-98 19:18:23 PAGES OPINPGT

cally refused to consider when it was presented in a priorpetition for certiorari. Since, under these circumstances,

the respondent school district and pupils naturally came tothis Court without expecting that a fundamental premise of
a portion of the District Court's remedial order would be-come the focus of the case, the essence of the Court's misjudgment in reviewing and repudiating that central premiselies in its failure to have warned the respondents of what
was really at stake. This failure lulled the respondents intoaddressing the case without sufficient attention to the foundational issue, and their lack of attention has now infectedthe Court's decision.

No one on the Court has had the benefit of briefing andargument informed by an appreciation of the potential
breadth of the ruling. The deficiencies from which we sufferhave led the Court effectively to overrule a unanimous constitutional precedent of 20 years' standing, which was noteven addressed in argument, was mentioned merely in passing by one of the parties, and discussed by another of themonly in a misleading way.

The Court's departures from the practices that produceinformed adjudication would call for dissent even in a simple
case. But in this one, with a trial history of more than 10years of litigation, the Court's failure to provide adequate
notice of the issue to be decided (or to limit the decision toissues on which certiorari was clearly granted) rules out any
confidence that today's result is sound, either in fact or inlaw.

moved to dismantle this system of separate education "rootand branch," id., at 1505, despite their affirmative obligation

to do that under the Constitution. Green v. School Bd. of
New Kent Cty., 391 U. S. 430, 437-438 (1968). "Instead, the[KCMSD] chose to operate some completely segregated

schools and some integrated ones," Jenkins, 593 F. Supp.,at 1492, using devices like optional attendance zones and liberal transfer policies to "allo[w] attendance patterns to con-tinue on a segregated basis." Id., at 1494. Consequently,
on the 20th anniversary of Brown in 1974, 39 of the 77 schoolsin the KCMSD had student bodies that were more than 90
percent black, and 80 percent of all black schoolchildren inthe KCMSD attended those schools. 593 F. Supp., at 1492-

tion. Since the District Court found that segregation hadcaused, among other things, "a system wide

reduction in student achievement in the schools of the KCMSD," Jenkins v.
Missouri, 639 F. Supp. 19, 24 (WD Mo. 1985) (emphasis in
original), it ordered the adoption, starting in 1985, of a series
of remedial programs to raise educational performance. Asthe Court recognizes, the District Court acted well within

the bounds of its equitable discretion in doing so, ante, at 90,101; in

Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U. S. 267 (1977) (Milliken
II), we held that a district court is authorized to remedy allconditions flowing directly from the constitutional violations

committed by state or local officials, including the educational deficits that result from a segregated school system
(programs aimed to correct those deficits are therefore frequently referred to as Milliken II programs). Id., at 281-
283. Nor was there any objection to the District Court's
orders from the State and the KCMSD, who agreed that it
was " `appropriate to include a number of properly targeted
educational programs in [the] desegregation plan,' " Jenkins,
639 F. Supp., at 24 (quoting from the State's desegregation
proposal). They endorsed many of the initiatives directed
at improving student achievement that the District Court
ultimately incorporated into its decree, including those calling for the attainment of AAA status for the KCMSD (a
designation, conferred by the State Department of Elementary and Secondary Education upon consideration of a limited number of criteria, indicating "that a school system
quantitatively and qualitatively has the resources necessary
to provide minimum basic education to its students," id., at
26), full day kindergarten, summer school, tutoring before
and after school, early childhood development, and reduction
in class sizes. Id., at 24-26.

Between 1985 and 1987 the District Court also ordered the
implementation of a magnet school concept, 1 App. 131-133
(Order of Nov. 12, 1986), and extensive capital improvements
to the schools of the KCMSD. Jenkins v. Missouri, 672

F. Supp. 400, 405-408 (WD Mo. 1987); 1 App. 133-134 (Order
of Nov. 12, 1986); Jenkins, 639 F. Supp., at 39-41. The District Court found that magnet schools would not only serve
to remedy the deficiencies in student achievement in the
KCMSD, but would also assist in desegregating the district
by attracting white students back into the school system.
See, e. g., 1 App. 118 (Order of June 16, 1986) ("[C]ommitment, when coupled with quality planning and sufficient resources can result in the establishment of magnet schools
which can attract non-minority enrollment as well as be an
integral part of district-wide improved student achievement"); see also Jenkins v. Missouri, 855 F. 2d 1295, 1301
(CA8 1988) ("The foundation of the plans adopted was the
idea that improving the KCMSD as a system would at the
same time compensate the blacks for the education they had
been denied and attract whites from within and without the
KCMSD to formerly black schools").

The District Court, finding that the physical facilities in
the KCMSD had "literally rotted," Jenkins, 672 F. Supp., at
411, similarly grounded its orders of capital improvements in
the related remedial objects of improving student achievement and desegregating the KCMSD. Jenkins, 639 F.
Supp., at 40 ("The improvement of school facilities is an important factor in the overall success of this desegregation
plan. Specifically, a school facility which presents safety and
health hazards to its students and faculty serves both as an
obstacle to education as well as to maintaining and attracting
non-minority enrollment. Further, conditions which impede
the creation of a good learning climate, such as heating deficiencies and leaking roofs, reduce the effectiveness of the
quality education components contained in this plan"); see
also Jenkins, 855 F. 2d, at 1305 ("[T]he capital improvements
[are] required both to improve the education available to the
victims of segregation as well as to attract whites to the
schools").

As a final element of its remedy, in 1987 the District Court
ordered funding for increases in teachers' salaries as a step
toward raising the level of student achievement. "[I]t is
essential that the KCMSD have sufficient revenues to fund
an operating budget which can provide quality education,
including a high quality faculty." Jenkins, 672 F. Supp.,
at 410. Neither the State nor the KCMSD objected to increases in teachers' salaries as an element of the comprehensive remedy, or to this cost as an item in the desegregation
budget.

In 1988, however, the State went to the Eighth Circuit
with a broad challenge to the District Court's remedial concept of magnet schools and to its orders of capital improvements (though it did not appeal the salary order), arguing
that the District Court had run afoul of Milliken v. Bradley,
418 U. S. 717 (1974) (Milliken I), by ordering an interdistrict
remedy for an intradistrict violation. The Eighth Circuit
rejected the State's position, Jenkins, 855 F. 2d 1295, and in
1989 the State petitioned for certiorari.

The State's petition presented two questions for review,
one challenging the District Court's authority to order a
property tax increase to fund its remedial program, the other
going to the legitimacy of the magnet school concept at the
very foundation of the Court's desegregation plan:

"For a purely intradistrict violation, the courts below
have ordered remedies--costing hundreds of millions of
dollars--with the stated goals of attracting more nonminority students to the school district and making programs and facilities comparable to those in neighboring
districts . . . .

"The questio[n] presented [is] . . . .

"b) require improvements to make the district schoolscomparable to those in surrounding districts." Pet. for
Cert. in Missouri v. Jenkins, O. T. 1988, No. 88-1150, p. i.
We accepted the taxation question, and decided that whilethe District Court could not impose the tax measure itself,

it could require the district to tax property at a rate ade-quate to fund its share of the costs of the desegregation remedy. Missouri v. Jenkins, 495 U. S. 33, 50-58 (1990). If wehad accepted the State's broader, foundational question
going to the magnet school concept, we could also have madean informed decision on whether that element of the District
Court's remedial scheme was within the limits of the Court'sequitable discretion in response to the constitutional violation found. Each party would have briefed the questionfully and would have identified in some detail those items in
the record bearing on it. But none of these things hap-pened. Instead of accepting the foundational question in
1989, we denied certiorari on it. Missouri v. Jenkins, 490U. S. 1034.

The State did not raise that question again when it re-turned to this Court with its 1994 petition for certiorari,
which led to today's decision. Instead, the State presented,and we agreed to review, these two questions:

"1. Whether a remedial educational desegregation program providing greater educational opportunities to victims of past de jure segregation than provided anywhereelse in the country nonetheless fails to satisfy the Fourteenth Amendment (thus precluding a finding of partialunitary status) solely because student achievement in
the District, as measured by results on standardized testscores, has not risen to some unspecified level?

"2. Whether a federal court order granting salary in-creases to virtually every employee of a school district--

including non-instructional personnel--as a part of aschool desegregation remedy conflicts with applicable

decisions of this court which require that remedial com-ponents must directly address and relate to the constitutional violation and be tailored to cure the condition thatoffends the Constitution?" Pet. for Cert. i.

These questions focus on two discrete issues: the extent towhich a district court may look at students' test scores in
determining whether a school district has attained partialunitary status as to its

Milliken II educational programs,and whether the particular salary increases ordered by the

District Court constitute a permissible component of itsremedy.

The State did not go beyond these discrete issues, and itframed no broader, foundational question about the validity
of the District Court's magnet concept. The Court decides,however, that it can reach that question of its own initiative,
and it sees no bar to this course in the provision of thisCourt's Rule 14.1 that "[o]nly the questions set forth in the
petition, or fairly included therein, will be considered . . . ."
Ante, at 84-85. The broader issue, the Court claims, is"fairly included" in the State's salary question. But that

claim does not survive scrutiny.The standard under Rule 14.1 is quite simple: as the Court
recognizes, we have held that an issue is fairly compre-hended in a question presented when the issue must be resolved in order to answer the question. See ibid., cit-ing

Procunier v. Navarette, 434 U. S. 555, 560, n. 6 (1978);United States v. Mendenhall, 446 U. S. 544, 551-552, n. 5

(1980). That should be the end of the matter here, sincethe State itself concedes that we can answer its salary and
test-score questions without addressing the soundness of themagnet element of the District Court's underlying remedial
scheme, see Brief for Petitioners 18 ("each question [pre-sented] can be dealt with on its own terms . . ."). While the
Court ignores that concession, it is patently correct. There

is no reason why we cannot take the questions as they come
to us; assuming the validity of the District Court's basic
remedial concept, we can determine the significance of test
scores and assess the salary orders in relation to that
concept.

Of course, as we understand necessity in prudential matters like this, it comes in degrees, and I would not deny that
sometimes differing judgments are possible about the need
to go beyond a question as originally accepted. But this
is not even arguably such a case. It is instead a case that
presents powerful reasons to confine discussion to the
questions taken.2

Quite naturally, the respondents here chose not to devote
any significant attention to a question not raised, and they
presumably had no reason to designate for printing those
portions of the record bearing on an issue not apparently
before us. And while respondents seemingly gave some
thought to the bare possibility that the Court would choose

2 Justice O'Connor suggests that I am saying something inconsistent
with the position I took in Bray v. Alexandria Women's Health Clinic,
506 U. S. 263 (1993), see ante, at 105, but her claim rests on a misunderstanding of my position in that case. I did not think that in Bray we could
reach the question whether respondents' claims fell within the "prevention
clause" of 42 U. S. C. $ 1985(3) simply because the question " `was briefed,
albeit sparingly, by the parties prior to the first oral argument.' " Ante,
at 105. Rather, I said that "[t]he applicability of the prevention clause is
fairly included within the questions presented, especially as restated by
respondents . . . ." Bray, supra, at 290 (Souter, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part). Thus the question was literally
before us (as Justice O'Connor believes the foundational question is before us under the second of the State's questions). What is not debatable
is that Bray was not preceded by prior litigation indicating we would not
consider the "prevention clause" issue, whereas this case was preceded by
a refusal to take the very foundational issue that Justice O'Connor argues is within the literal terms of the second question focusing on salaries.
See supra, at 143-144. I obviously thought the Court was wrong to reject supplemental briefing on the prevention clause, but that rejection was
a far cry from refusing to take the issue.

to deal with the discrete questions by going beyond them toa more comprehensive underlying issue, they were entitled

to reject that possibility as a serious one for the very reasonthat the Court had already, in 1989, expressly refused to consider that foundational issue when the State expressly attempted to raise it. Our deliberate refusal to entertain soimportant an issue is and ought to be a reasonable basis to

infer that we will not subsequently allow it to be raised onour own motion without saying so in advance and giving notice to a party whose interests might be adversely affected.Thus the Court misses the point when it argues that the
foundational issue is in a sense antecedent to the specific
ones raised, and that those can be answered by finding error
in some element of the underlying remedial scheme. Even
if the Court were correct that the foundational issue could
be reached under Rule 14.1, the critical question surely is
whether that issue may fairly be decided without clear warning, at the culmination of a course of litigation in which this
Court has specifically refused to consider the issue and given
no indication of any subsequent change of mind. The answer is obviously no. And the Court's claim of necessity
rings particularly hollow when one considers that if it really
were essential to decide the foundational issue to address the
two questions that are presented, the Court could give notice
to the parties of its intention to reach the broader issue, and
allow for adequate briefing and argument on it. And yet
the Court does none of that, but simply decides the issue
without any warning to respondents.

If there is any doubt about the lack of fairness and prudence displayed by the Court, it should disappear upon
seeing two things: first, how readily the questions presented
can be answered on their own terms, without giving any
countenance to the State's now successful attempt to " `smuggl[e] additional questions into a case after we grant[ed] certiorari,' " Izumi Seimitsu Kogyo Kabushiki Kaisha v. U. S.

fornia, 347 U. S. 128, 129 (1954) (plurality opinion of Jackson,J.); and, second, how the Court's decision to go beyond those

questions to address an issue not adequately briefed or ar-gued by one set of parties leads it to render an opinion
anchored in neither the findings and evidence contained inthe record, nor in controlling precedent, which is squarely
at odds with the Court's holding today.

II

A

The test-score question as it comes to us is one of wordplay, not substance. While the Court insists that the District Court's Order of June 17, 1992 (the only order relevantto the test-score question on review here), "requir[ed] the
State to continue to fund the quality education programs be-cause student achievement levels [in the KCMSD] were still
`at or below national norms at many grade levels' . . . ," ante,at 100; see also ante, at 73, that order contains no discussion
at all of student achievement levels in the KCMSD in com-parison to national norms, and in fact does not explicitly address the subject of partial unitary status. App. to Pet. forCert. A-69 to A-75. The reference to test scores "at or
below national norms" comes from an entirely different andsubsequent order of the District Court (dated Apr. 16, 1993)
which is not under review. Its language presumably wouldnot have been quoted to us, if the Court of Appeals's opinion
affirming the District Court's June 17, 1992, order had notcanvassed subsequent orders and mentioned the District
Court's finding of fact that the "KCMSD is still at or belownational norms at many grade levels," 11 F. 3d 755, 762
(CA8 1994), citing Order of Apr. 16, 1993, App. to Pet. forCert. A-130. In any event, what is important here is that
none of the District Court's or Court of Appeals's opinionsor orders requires a certain level of test scores before unitary status can be found, or indicates that test scores are theonly thing standing between the State and a finding of uni515us1$67m 08-25-98 19:18:23 PAGES OPINPGT

Souter, J., dissenting
tary status as to the KCMSD's Milliken II programs. In-deed, the opinion concurring in the denial of rehearing en

banc below (not mentioned by the Court, although it is cer-tainly more probative of the governing law in the Eighth
Circuit than the dissenting opinion on which the Court does
rely) expressly disavows any dispositive role for test scores:

"The dissent accepts, at least in part, the State's argu-ment that the district court adopted a student achievement goal, measured by test scores, as the only basisfor determining whether past discrimination has been
remedied. . . . When we deal with student achievement
in a quality education program in the context of reliev-ing a school district of court supervision, test results

must be considered. Test scores, however, must be onlyone factor in the equation. Nothing in this court's opinion, the district court's opinion, or the testimony ofKCMSD's witnesses indicates that test results were the
only criteria used in denying the State's claim that its
obligation for the quality education programs should beended by a declaration they are unitary." 19 F. 3d 393,

395 (1994) (Gibson, J., concurring in denial of rehearingen banc).

If, then, test scores do not explain why there was no finding of unitary status as to the Milliken II programs, one
may ask what does explain it. The answer is quite straight-forward. The Court of Appeals refused to order the District Court to enter a finding of partial unitary status asto the KCMSD's

Milliken II programs (and apparently, the
District Court did not speak to the issue itself ) simply because the State did not attempt to make the showing required for that relief. As the Court recognizes, ante, at 88-
89, we have established a clear set of procedures to be
followed by governmental entities seeking the partial termination of a desegregation decree. In Freeman v. Pitts, 503
U. S. 467 (1992), we held that "[t]he duty and responsibility

515us1$67m 08-25-98 19:18:23 PAGES OPINPGT
150 MISSOURI v. JENKINS

Souter, J., dissenting
of a school district once segregated by law is to take all stepsnecessary to eliminate the vestiges of the unconstitutional

de jure system." Id., at 485. Accordingly, before a districtcourt may grant a school district (or other governmental entity) partial release from a desegregation decree, it must first
consider "whether there has been full and satisfactory com-pliance with the decree in those aspects of the system where

supervision is to be withdrawn . . . ." Id., at 491. Full andsatisfactory compliance, we emphasized in

Freeman, is to be
measured by " `whether the vestiges of past discriminationha[ve] been eliminated to the extent practicable.' "

Id., at
492, quoting Board of Ed. of Oklahoma City Public Schools
v. Dowell, 498 U. S. 237, 249-250 (1991). The district court
must then consider "whether retention of judicial control is
necessary or practicable to achieve compliance with the decree in other facets of the school system; and whether the
school district [or other governmental entity] has demonstrated, to the public and to the parents and students of the
once disfavored race, its good-faith commitment to the whole
of the court's decree and to those provisions of the law and
the Constitution that were the predicate for judicial intervention in the first instance." 503 U. S., at 491. The
burden of showing that these conditions to finding partial
unitary status have been met rests (as one would expect)
squarely on the constitutional violator who seeks relief from
the existing remedial order. Id., at 494.

While the Court recognizes the three-part showing that
the State must make under Freeman in order to get a finding
of partial unitary status, ante, at 88-89, it fails to acknowledge that the State did not even try to make a Freeman
showing in the litigation leading up to the District Court's
Order of June 17, 1992. The District Court's order was triggered not by a motion for partial unitary status filed by the
State, but by a motion filed by the KCMSD for approval of
its desegregation plan for the 1992-1993 school year. See
App. to Pet. for Cert. A-69. While the State's response to

that motion suggested that the District Court should entera finding of partial unitary status as to the district's Milliken

II component of its decree, State's Response to KCMSDMotion for Approval of Desegregation Plan for 1992-1993,
pp. 1-20 (hereinafter State's Response), the State failed evento allege its compliance with two of the three prongs of the
Freeman test.The State did not claim that implementation of the

Milli-ken II component of the decree had remedied the reduction

in student achievement in the KCMSD to the extent practi-cable; it simply argued that various Milliken II programs
had been implemented. State's Response 9-17. Accord-ingly, in the hearings held by the District Court on the
KCMSD's motion, the State's expert witness testified onlythat the various

Milliken II programs had been imple-mented and had increased educational opportunity in the district. 2 App. 439-483. With the exception of the "effectiveschools" program, he said nothing about the effects of those
programs on student achievement, and in fact admitted oncross-examination that he did not have an opinion as to
whether the programs had remedied to the extent practica-ble the reduction in student achievement caused by the segregation in the KCMSD.

"Q: Dr. Stewart, do you, testifying on behalf of the State. . . have an opinion as to whether or not the educational

deficits that you acknowledged were vestiges of theprior segregation have been eliminated to the extent
practicable in the Kansas City School District?
"A: No, that's not the purpose of my testimony, Mr.
Benson." Id., at 483.

Nor did the State focus on its own good faith in complying
with the District Court's decree; it emphasized instead thedistrict's commitment to the decree and to the constitutional

provisions on which the decree rested. State's Response 8.The State, indeed, said nothing to contradict the very find515us1$67m 08-25-98 19:18:23 PAGES OPINPGT

Souter, J., dissenting
ings made elsewhere by the District Court that have called
the State's own commitment to the success of the decree into
question. See, e. g., 1 App. 136 (Order of Nov. 12, 1986)
("[D]uring the course of this lawsuit the Court has not been
informed of one affirmative act voluntarily taken by the Executive Department of the State of Missouri or the Missouri
General Assembly to aid a school district that is involved in
a desegregation program"); see also App. to Pet. for Cert.
A-123 (Order of Apr. 16, 1993) ("The State, also a constitutional violator, has historically opposed the implementation
of any program offered to desegregate the KCMSD. The
Court recognizes that the State has had to bear the brunt of
the costs of desegregation due to the joint and several liability finding previously made by the Court. However, the
State has never offered the Court a viable, even tenable,
alternative and has been extremely antagonistic in its
approach to effecting the desegregation of the KCMSD")
(emphasis in original).

Thus, it was the State's failure to meet or even to recognize its burden under Freeman that led the Court of Appeals to reject the suggestion that it make a finding of partial
unitary status as to the district's Milliken II education
programs:

"It is . . . significant that the testimony of [the State's
expert] did no more than describe the successful establishment of the several educational programs, but gave
no indication of whether these programs had succeeded
in improving student achievement. . . .

"The only evidence before the district court with respect to the degree of progress on elimination of vestiges of past discrimination was at best that a start had
been made. The evidence on the record fell far short of
establishing that such vestiges had been eliminated to
the extent practicable. . . .

". . . [Further, the] State did not try to prove that ithas demonstrated a good faith commitment to the whole

of the court's decree. . . .. . . . .

". . . [T]he district court did not abuse its discretion incontinuing the quality education programs." 11 F. 3d,
at 764-765 (citations omitted).
Examining only the first Freeman prong, there can be nodoubt that the Court of Appeals was correct.

Freeman and
Dowell make it entirely clear that the central focus of thisprong of the unitary status enquiry is on effects: to the extent reasonably possible, a constitutional violator must rem-edy the ills caused by its actions before it can be freed of the
court-ordered obligations it has brought upon itself. Underthe logic of the State's arguments to the District Court, the
moment the Milliken II programs were put in place, theState was at liberty to walk away from them, no matter how
great the remaining consequences of segregation for educa-tional quality or how great the potential for curing them if
state funding continued.Looking ahead, if indeed the State believes itself entitled
to a finding of partial unitary status on the subject of educa-tional programs, there is an orderly procedural course for it
to follow. It may frame a proper motion for partial unitarystatus, and prepare to make a record sufficient to allow the
District Court and the Court of Appeals to address the con-tinued need for and efficacy of the Milliken II programs.

In the development of a proper unitary status record, testscores will undoubtedly play a role. It is true, as the Court
recognizes, that all parties to this case agree that it wouldbe error to require that the students in a school district
attain the national average test score as a prerequisite to afinding of partial unitary status, if only because all sorts of
causes independent of the vestiges of past school segregationmight stand in the way of the goal.

Ante, at 101-102. That

said, test scores will clearly be relevant in determiningwhether the improvement programs have cured a deficiency

in student achievement to the practicable extent. The Dis-trict Court has noted (in the finding that the Court would
read as a dispositive requirement for unitary status) thatwhile students' scores have shown a trend of improvement,
they remain at or below national norms. App. to Pet. forCert. A-131 (Order of Apr. 16, 1993). The significance of
this fact is subject to assessment. Depending, of course, onother facts developed in the course of unitary status proceedings, the improvement to less than the national averagemight reasonably be taken to show that education programs
are having a good effect on student achievement, and thatfurther improvement can be expected. On the other hand,
if test-score changes were shown to have flattened out, thatmight suggest the impracticability of any additional remedial
progress. While the significance of scores is thus open tojudgment, the judgment is not likely to be very sound unless
it is informed by more of a record than we have in front ofus, and the Court's admonition that the District Court should
"sharply limit" its reliance on test scores, ante, at 101, shouldbe viewed in this light.

B
The other question properly before us has to do with thepropriety of the District Court's recent salary orders.

While the Court suggests otherwise, ante, at 84, 100, theDistrict Court did not ground its orders of salary increases
solely on the goal of attracting students back to the KCMSD.From the start, the District Court has consistently treated
salary increases as an important element in remedying thesystemwide reduction in student achievement resulting from
segregation in the KCMSD. As noted above, the Court doesnot question this remedial goal, which we expressly approved in Milliken II. See supra, at 141-143. The onlyissue, then, is whether the salary increases ordered by the
District Court have been reasonably related to achieving

that goal, keeping in mind the broad discretion enjoyed bythe District Court in exercising its equitable powers.

The District Court first ordered KCMSD salary increases,limited to teachers, in 1987, basing its decision on the need
to raise the level of student achievement. "[I]t is essential
that the KCMSD have sufficient revenues to fund an operat-ing budget which can provide quality education, including a

high quality faculty." Jenkins, 672 F. Supp., at 410. TheState raised no objection to the District Court's order, and
said nothing about the issue of salary increases in its 1988appeal to the Eighth Circuit.

When the District Court's 1987 order expired in 1990, all
parties, including the State, agreed to a further order increasing salaries for both instructional and noninstructional
personnel through the 1991-1992 school year. 1 App. 332-
337 (Order of July 23, 1990). In 1992 the District Court
merely ordered that salaries in the KCMSD be maintained
at the same level for the following year, rejecting the State's
argument that desegregation funding for salaries should be
discontinued, App. to Pet. for Cert. A-76 to A-93 (Order of
June 25, 1992), and in 1993 the District Court ordered small
salary increases for both instructional and noninstructional
personnel through the end of the 1995-1996 school year, App.
to Pet. for Cert. A-94 to A-109 (Order of June 30, 1993).

It is the District Court's 1992 and 1993 orders that are
before us, and it is difficult to see how the District Court
abused its discretion in either instance. The District Court
had evidence in front of it that adopting the State's position
and discontinuing desegregation funding for salary levels
would result in their abrupt drop to 1986-1987 levels, with
the resulting disparity between teacher pay in the district
and the nationwide level increasing to as much as 40 to 45
percent, and a mass exodus of competent employees likely
taking place. Id., at A-76, A-78 to A-91. Faced with this
evidence, the District Court found that continued desegregation funding of salaries, and small increases in those salaries

over time, were essential to the successful implementation
of its remedial scheme, including the elevation of student
achievement:

"[I]n the absence of desegregation funding for salaries,
the District will not be able to implement its desegregation plan. . . .. . . . .

"High quality personnel are necessary not only to implement specialized desegregation programs intended to
`improve educational opportunities and reduce racial isolation,' but also to `ensure that there is no diminution in
the quality of its regular academic program.' . . .

". . . There is no question but that a salary roll back
would have effects that would drastically impair implementation of the desegregation remedy.. . . . .

". . . A salary roll back would result in excessive employee turnover, a decline in the quality and commitment of work and an inability of the KCMSD to achieve
the objectives of the desegregation plan." Id., at A-86
to A-91 (Order of June 25, 1992), quoting Jenkins, 855
F. 2d, at 1301, and Jenkins, 672 F. Supp., at 410.

See also App. to Pet. for Cert. A-95 to A-97, A-101 to A-102
(Order of June 30, 1993). The Court of Appeals affirmed the
District Court's orders on the basis of these findings, again
taking special note of the importance of adequate salaries to
the remedial goal of improving student achievement:

"[Q]uality education programs and magnet schools [are]
a part of the remedy for the vestiges of segregation
causing a system wide reduction in student achievement
in the KCMSD schools. . . . The significant finding of the
[district] court with respect to the earlier funding order
was that the salary increases were essential to comply
with the court's desegregation orders, and that high

quality teachers, administrators, and staff must be hiredto improve the desegregative attractiveness of KCMSD.

. . . . .
". . . It is evident that the district court had before itsubstantial evidence of a statistically significant reduction in the turnover rates for full-time employees, a dra-matic increase in the percentage of certified employees
selecting KCMSD because of the salary increases, and asignificant decline in the number of employees lost to
other districts. Further, the court heard testimonythat the average performance evaluation for the professional employees increased positively and significantly."13 F. 3d 1170, 1172-1174 (CA8 1993).

See also 11 F. 3d, at 766-769.There is nothing exceptionable in the lower courts' findings about the relationship between salaries and the DistrictCourt's remedial objectives, and certainly nothing in the record suggests obvious error as to the amounts of the increasesordered.

3 If it is tempting to question the place of salary

increases for administrative and maintenance personnel ina desegregation order, the Court of Appeals addressed the

temptation in specifically affirming the District Court's find-ing that such personnel are critical to the success of the desegregation effort, 13 F. 3d, at 1174 (referring to order ofJune 30, 1993, App. to Pet. for Cert. A-104), and did so in
the circumstances of a district whose schools have beenplagued by leaking roofs, defective lighting, and reeking

3 There is no claim of anything unreasonable in the salary increases
merely because the District Court has ordered them, whereas they might
otherwise have been set by collective bargaining. For that matter, the
Court of Appeals observed that the District Court has not replaced collective bargaining in the KCMSD with a rubber stamping of union requests,
but rather has "juridically pruned applications of funding that have been
presented to it," 13 F. 3d, at 1174, ordering salary increases that have
been far smaller than those requested by the union. See, e. g., App. to
Pet. for Cert. A-102, A-104 to A-106 (Order of June 30, 1993).

lavatories. See Jenkins, 855 F. 2d, at 1306; Jenkins, 672F. Supp., at 403-404. As for teachers' increases, the District

Court and the Court of Appeals were beyond reproach infinding and affirming that in order to remedy the educational
deficits flowing from segregation in the KCMSD, "those per-sons charged with implementing the [remedial] plan [must]
be the most qualified persons reasonably attainable," App. toPet. for Cert. A-102.

Indeed, the Court does not question the District Court'ssalary orders insofar as they relate to the objective of raising
the level of student achievement in the KCMSD, but ratheroverlooks that basis for the orders altogether. The Court
suggests that the District Court rested its approval of salaryincreases only on the object of drawing students into the
district's schools, ante, at 91, and rejects the increases forthat reason. It seems clear, however, that the District
Court and the Court of Appeals both viewed the salary or-ders as serving two complementary but distinct purposes,
and to the extent that the District Court concludes on re-mand that its salary orders are justified by reference to the
quality of education alone, nothing in the Court's opinionprecludes those orders from remaining in effect.

III
The two discrete questions that we actually accepted forreview are, then, answerable on their own terms without any

need to consider whether the District Court's use of the mag-net school concept in its remedial plan is itself constitutionally vulnerable. The capacity to deal thus with the ques-tions raised, coupled with the unfairness of doing otherwise
without warning, are enough to demand a dissent.But there is more to fuel dissent. On its face, the Court's
opinion projects an appealing pragmatism in seeming to cutthrough the details of many facts by applying a rule of law
that can claim both precedential support and intuitive sense,that there is error in imposing an interdistrict remedy to

cure a merely intradistrict violation. Since the DistrictCourt has consistently described the violation here as solely

intradistrict, and since the object of the magnet schoolsunder its plan includes attracting students into the district
from other districts, the Court's result seems to follow withthe necessity of logic, against which arguments about detail
or calls for fair warning may not carry great weight.The attractiveness of the Court's analysis disappears, however, as soon as we recognize two things. First, the DistrictCourt did not mean by an "intradistrict violation" what the
Court apparently means by it today. The District Courtmeant that the violation within the KCMSD had not led to
segregation outside of it, and that no other school districtshad played a part in the violation. It did not mean that the
violation had not produced effects of any sort beyond thedistrict. Indeed, the record that we have indicates that the
District Court understood that the violation here didproduce effects spanning district borders and leading to
greater segregation within the KCMSD, the reversal ofwhich the District Court sought to accomplish by establishing magnet schools.4 Insofar as the Court assumes that this

4 This was not the only, or even the principal, purpose of the magnet
schools. The District Court found that magnet schools would assist in
remedying the deficiencies in student achievement in the KCMSD, see
supra, at 141-142. Moreover, while the Court repeatedly describes the
magnet school program as looking beyond the boundaries of the district,
the program is primarily aimed not at drawing back white children whose
parents have moved to another district, but rather at drawing back children who attend private schools while living within the geographical confines of the KCMSD, whose population remains majority white, Jenkins v.
Missouri, 855 F. 2d 1295, 1302-1303 (CA8 1988). See 1 App. 132 (Order
of Nov. 12, 1986) ("Most importantly, the Court believes that the proposed
magnet plan is so attractive that it would draw non-minority students
from the private schools who have abandoned or avoided the KCMSD, and
draw in additional non-minority students from the suburbs"). As such, a
substantial impetus for the District Court's remedy does not consider the
world beyond district boundaries at all, and much of the Court's opinion
is of little significance to the case before it.

was not so in fact, there is at least enough in the recordto cast serious doubt on its assumption. Second, the Court

violates existing case law even on its own apparent view ofthe facts, that the segregation violation within the KCMSD
produced no proven effects, segregative or otherwise, out-side it. Assuming this to be true, the Court's decision
that the rule against interdistrict remedies for intradistrictviolations applies to this case, solely because the remedy
here is meant to produce effects outside the district inwhich the violation occurred, is flatly contrary to established precedent. A

The Court appears to assume that the effects of segrega-tion were wholly contained within the KCMSD, and based
on this assumption argues that any remedy looking beyondthe district's boundaries is forbidden. The Court's position
rests on the premise that the District Court and the Courtof Appeals erred in finding that segregation had produced
effects outside the district, and hence were in error whenthey treated the reversal of those effects as a proper subject
of the equitable power to eliminate the remaining vestigesof the old segregation so far as practicable.

The Court has not shown the trial court and the EighthCircuit to be wrong on the facts, however, and on the record
before us this Court's factual assumption is at the very leasta questionable basis for removing one major foundation of
the desegregation decree. I do not, of course, claim to be ina position to say for sure that the Court is wrong, for I, like
the Court, am a victim of an approach to the case uninformedby any warning that a foundational issue would be dispositive. My sole point is that the Court is not in any obvioussense correct, wherever the truth may ultimately lie.

To be sure, the District Court found, and the Court of Ap-peals affirmed, that the suburban school districts (SSD's) had
taken no action contributing to segregation in the KCMSD.Jenkins v. Missouri, 807 F. 2d 657, 664, 668-670 (CA8 1986);

3 App. 723, 738 (Order of June 5, 1984). Those courts fur-ther concluded that the constitutional violations committed

by the State and the KCMSD had not produced any signifi-cant segregative effects in the SSD's, all of which have operated as unitary districts since shortly after our decision in
Brown. Jenkins, 807 F. 2d, at 672, 678; 3 App. 813, 816. Itwas indeed on the basis of just these findings that the District Court concluded that it was dealing with an intradis-trict violation, and, consistently with our decision in

Milliken I, refused to consolidate the SSD's with the KCMSD.
Jenkins, 807 F. 2d, at 660-661, 674; 3 App. 721-723, 725,
810-811.

There is no inconsistency between these findings and the
possibility, however, that the actions of the State and the
KCMSD produced significant nonsegregative effects outside
the KCMSD that led to greater segregation within it. To
the contrary, the District Court and the Court of Appeals
concurred in finding that "the preponderance of black students in the [KCMSD] was due to the State and KCMSD's
constitutional violations, which caused white flight. . . .
[T]he existence of segregated schools led to white flight from
the KCMSD to suburban districts and to private schools."
Jenkins, 855 F. 2d, at 1302, citing the District Court's Order
of Aug. 25, 1986, 1 App. 126 ("[S]egregated schools, a constitutional violation, ha[ve] led to white flight from the KCMSD
to suburban districts [and] large numbers of students leaving
the schools of Kansas City and attending private schools
. . ."). While this exodus of white students would not have
led to segregation within the SSD's, which have all been run
in a unitary fashion since the time of Brown, it clearly represented an effect spanning district borders, and one which the
District Court and the Court of Appeals expressly attributed
to segregation in the KCMSD.

The Court, however, rejects the findings of the District
Court, endorsed by the Court of Appeals, that segregation
led to white flight from the KCMSD, and does so at the ex515us1$67m 08-25-98 19:18:23 PAGES OPINPGT

pense of another accepted norm of our appellate procedure.We have long adhered to the view that "[a] court of law, such

as this Court is, rather than a court for correction of errorsin factfinding, cannot undertake to review concurrent findings of fact by two courts below in the absence of a very
obvious and exceptional showing of error." Graver Tank &
Mfg. Co. v. Linde Air Products Co., 336 U. S. 271, 275 (1949);
see also Branti v. Finkel, 445 U. S. 507, 512, n. 6 (1980) (refer-ring to "our settled practice of accepting, absent the most

exceptional circumstances, factual determinations in whichthe district court and the court of appeals have concurred").
The Court fails to show any exceptional circumstance pres-ent here, however: it relies on a "contradiction" that is not
an obvious contradiction at all, and on an arbitrary "supposition" that " `white flight' may result from desegregation, not
de jure segregation," ante, at 95, a supposition said to be
bolstered by the District Court's statement that there was"an abundance of evidence that many residents of the

KCMSD left the district and moved to the suburbs becauseof the district's efforts to integrate its schools." 672 F.
Supp., at 412.5The doubtful contradiction is said to exist between the
District Court's findings, on the one hand, that segregationcaused white flight to the SSD's, and the Court of Appeals's
conclusion, on the other, that the District Court " `made spe-cific findings that negate current significant interdistrict
effects . . . .' " Ante, at 96, quoting Jenkins, 807 F. 2d, at672. Any impression of contradiction quickly disappears,
however, when the Court of Appeals's statement is read
in context:

"[T]he [district] court explicitly recognized that [toconsolidate school districts] under

Milliken [I] `there

5 Justice O'Connor also rests on supposition. See ante, at 113 ("In
this case, it may be the `myriad factors of human existence,' that have
prompted the white exodus from the KCMSD . . .") (citation omitted).

must be evidence of a constitutional violation in one
district that produces a significant segregative effect in
another district.' Order of June 5, 1984 at 14, 95. . . .
The district court thus dealt not only with the issue of
whether the SSDs were constitutional violators but also
whether there were significant interdistrict segregative
effects. See V, infra. When it did so, it made specific
findings that negate current significant interdistrict
effects . . . ." Ibid.

It is clear that, in this passage, the Court of Appeals was
summarizing the District Court's findings that the constitutional violations within the KCMSD had not produced any
segregative effects in other districts. Ibid. While the
Court of Appeals did not repeat the word "segregative" in
its concluding sentence, there is nothing to indicate that it
was referring to anything but segregative effects, and there
is in fact nothing in the District Court's own statements
going beyond its finding that the State and the KCMSD's
actions did not lead to segregative effects in the SSD's.6

6 The Court states that the Court of Appeals would not have decided
the question whether the State and the KCMSD's violations produced segregative effects in the SSD's, as respondents lacked standing to raise the
issue. Ante, at 96, n. 9. This statement eludes explanation. In Milliken I, 418 U. S. 717 (1974), we held that before a district court may order
the mandatory interdistrict reassignment of students throughout a metropolitan area, it must first find either that multiple school districts participated in the unconstitutional segregation of students, or that the violation
within a single school district "produce[d] . . . significant segregative effect[s]" in the others. Id., at 744-745. See ante, at 93; ante, at 105, 108
(O'Connor, J., concurring); see also infra, at 170-171. In the earlier
stages of this litigation, the Jenkins respondents sought the mandatory
reassignment of students throughout the Kansas City metropolitan area,
and the District Court, 3 App. 721-820 (Order of June 5, 1984), and the
Court of Appeals, Jenkins, 807 F. 2d, at 665-666, 672, rejected such relief
on the grounds that the requirements of Milliken I had not been satisfied.
The Court is now saying that respondents lacked standing to raise the
issue of interdistrict segregative effects, and that the District Court and

There is, in turn, no contradiction between this finding andthe District Court's findings about white flight: while white

flight would have produced significant effects in other schooldistricts, in the form of greatly increased numbers of white
students, those effects would not have been segregative be-yond the KCMSD, as the departing students were absorbed
into wholly unitary systems.Without the contradiction, the Court has nothing to justify
its rejection of the District Court's finding that segregationcaused white flight but its supposition that flight results from
integration, not segregation. The supposition, and the dis-tinction on which it rests, are untenable. At the more obvious level, there is in fact no break in the chain of causationlinking the effects of desegregation with those of segregation. There would be no desegregation orders and no reme-dial plans without prior unconstitutional segregation as the
occasion for issuing and adopting them, and an adverse reac-tion to a desegregation order is traceable in fact to the segregation that is subject to the remedy. When the Courtquotes the District Court's reference to abundant evidence
that integration caused flight to the suburbs, then, it quotesnothing inconsistent with the District Court's other findings
that segregation had caused the flight. The only difference
between the statements lies in the point to which the Dis-trict Court happened to trace the causal sequence.

The unreality of the Court's categorical distinction can be
illustrated by some examples. There is no dispute that be-fore the District Court's remedial plan was placed into effect

the schools in the unreformed segregated system were physi-cally a shambles:

"The KCMSD facilities still have numerous health and
safety hazards, educational environment hazards, functional impairments, and appearance impairments. The

the Court of Appeals lacked the authority to reach the issue, even though
that is precisely what was required of them under Milliken I.

specific problems include: inadequate lighting; peelingpaint and crumbling plaster on ceilings, walls and corridors; loose tiles, torn floor coverings; odors result-ing from unventilated restrooms with rotted, corroded
toilet fixtures; noisy classrooms due to lack of adequateacoustical treatment; lack of off street parking and bus
loading for parents, teachers and students; lack of appro-priate space for many cafeterias, libraries, and classrooms; faulty and antiquated heating and electrical sys-tems; damaged and inoperable lockers; and inadequate
fire safety systems. The conditions at Paseo HighSchool are such that even the principal stated that he
would not send his own child to that facility." 672 F.Supp., at 403 (citations omitted).

See also Jenkins, 855 F. 2d, at 1300 (reciting District Courtfindings);

Jenkins, 639 F. Supp., at 39-40. The cost of turn-ing this shambles into habitable schools was enormous, as

anyone would have seen long before the District Court or-dered repairs. See

Missouri v. Jenkins, 495 U. S., at 38-40(discussing the costs of the remedial program and the resulting increases in tax rates within the KCMSD). Propertytax-paying parents of white children, seeing the handwriting
on the wall in 1985, could well have decided that the inevita-ble cost of cleanup would produce an intolerable tax rate and
could have moved to escape it. The District Court's reme-dial orders had not yet been put in place. Was the white
flight caused by segregation or desegregation? The distinc-tion has no significance.

Another example makes the same point. After Brown,white parents likely came to understand that the practice of
spending more on white schools than on black ones would bestopped at some point. If they were unwilling to raise all
expenditures to match the customary white school level, theymust have expected the expenditures on white schools to
drop to the level of those for the segregated black schools orto some level in between. See, e. g., 639 F. Supp., at 39-40

(describing a decline in all 68 of the KCMSD's school build-ings in the past "10 to 15 years"). If they thus believed that

the white schools would deteriorate they might then havetaken steps to establish private white schools, starting a
practice of local private education that has endured. Again,what sense does it make to say of this example that the cause
of white private education was desegregation (not yet under-way), rather than the segregation that led to it?

I do not claim that either of these possible explanationswould ultimately turn out to be correct, for any such claim
would head me down the same road the Court is taking, ofresolving factual issues independently of the trial court without warning the respondents that the full evidentiary recordbearing on the issue should be identified for us. My point
is only that the Court is on shaky grounds when it assumesthat prior segregation and later desegregation are separable
in fact as causes of "white flight," that the flight can plausiblybe said to result from desegregation alone, and that therefore as a matter of fact the "intradistrict" segregation viola-tion lacked the relevant consequences outside the district required to justify the District Court's magnet concept. Withthe arguable plausibility of each of these assumptions seriously in question, it is simply rash to reverse the concurrentfactual findings of the District Court and the Court of Appeals. All the judges who spoke to the issue below con-cluded that segregated schooling in the KCMSD contributed
to the exodus of white students from the district. Amongthem were not only the judges most familiar with the record
of this litigation, Judge Clark of the District Court and thethree members of the Court of Appeals panel that has retained jurisdiction over the case, see supra, at 162-164, butalso the five judges who dissented from the denial of rehearing en banc in the Court of Appeals (whose opinion the ma-jority does not hesitate to rely on for other purposes):

"[By 1985], `[w]hite flight' to private schools and to thesuburbs was rampant.

"The district court, correctly recognizing that at leastpart of this problem was the consequence of the de jure

segregation previously practiced under Missouri consti-tutional and statutory law, fashioned a remedial plan for
the desegregation of the KCMSD . . . ." 19 F. 3d, at
397 (Beam, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing enbanc).

The reality is that the Court today overturns the concurrent
factual findings of the District Court and the Court ofAppeals without having identified any circumstance in the

record sufficient to warrant such an extraordinary course
of action. B

To the substantial likelihood that the Court proceeds on
erroneous assumptions of fact must be added corresponding
errors of law. We have most recently summed up the obli-gation to correct the condition of

de jure segregation by saying that "the duty of a former de jure district is to `takewhatever steps might be necessary to convert to a unitary

system in which racial discrimination would be eliminatedroot and branch.' "

Freeman, 503 U. S., at 486, quoting
Green, 391 U. S., at 437-438. Although the fashioning of ju-dicial remedies to this end has been left, in the first instance,

to the equitable discretion of the district courts, in Milliken
I we established an absolute limitation on this exercise ofequitable authority. "[W]ithout an interdistrict violation

and interdistrict effect, there is no constitutional wrong call-ing for an interdistrict remedy."

Milliken I, 418 U. S., at
745.

The Court proceeds as if there is no question but that this
proscription applies to this case. But the proscription does
not apply. We are not dealing here with an interdistrict
remedy in the sense that Milliken I used the term. In the
Milliken I litigation, the District Court had ordered 53 surrounding school districts to be consolidated with the Detroit

school system, and mandatory busing to be started withinthe enlarged district, even though the court had not found

that any of the suburban districts had acted in violation ofthe Constitution. "The metropolitan remedy would require,
in effect, consolidation of 54 independent school districts his-torically administered as separate units into a vast new
super school district." Id., at 743. It was this imposition ofremedial measures on more than the one wrongdoing school
district that we termed an "interdistrict remedy":

"We . . . turn to address, for the first time, the validityof a remedy mandating cross-district or interdistrict

consolidation to remedy a condition of segregation foundto exist in only one district." Id., at 744.

And it was just this subjection to court order of schooldistricts not shown to have violated the Constitution that
we deemed to be in error:

"Before the boundaries of separate and autonomousschool districts may be set aside by consolidating the

separate units for remedial purposes or by imposing across-district remedy, it must first be shown that there
has been a constitutional violation within one districtthat produces a significant segregative effect in another district. . . .". . . To approve the remedy ordered by the court
would impose on the outlying districts, not shown tohave committed any constitutional violation, a wholly
impermissible remedy based on a standard not hintedat in

Brown I and II or any holding of this Court."Id., at 744-745.

We did not hold, however, that any remedy that takes intoaccount conditions outside of the district in which a constitutional violation has been committed is an "interdistrict rem-edy," and as such improper in the absence of an "interdistrict
violation." To the contrary, by emphasizing that remediesin school desegregation cases are grounded in traditional eq515us1$67m 08-25-98 19:18:23 PAGES OPINPGT

uitable principles, id., at 737-738, we left open the possibilitythat a district court might subject a proven constitutional

wrongdoer to a remedy with intended effects going beyondthe district of the wrongdoer's violation, when such a remedy
is necessary to redress the harms flowing from the constitutional violation.The Court, nonetheless, reads

Milliken I quite differently.
It reads the case as categorically forbidding imposition of aremedy on a guilty district with intended consequences in a

neighboring innocent district, unless the constitutional viola-tion yielded segregative effects in that innocent district.
See, e. g., ante, at 92 ("But this interdistrict goal [of attracting nonminority students from outside the KCMSD schools]
is beyond the scope of the intradistrict violation identified
by the District Court" (emphasis deleted)).

Today's decision therefore amounts to a redefinition of the
terms of Milliken I and consequently to a substantial expansion of its limitation on the permissible remedies for prior
segregation. But that is not the only prior law affected by
today's decision. The Court has not only rewritten Milliken
I; it has effectively overruled a subsequent case expressly
refusing to constrain remedial equity powers to the extent
the Court does today, and holding that courts ordering relief
from unconstitutional segregation may, with an appropriate
factual predicate, exercise just the authority that the Court
today eliminates.

Two Terms after Milliken, we decided Hills v. Gautreaux,
425 U. S. 284 (1976), in a unanimous opinion by Justice Stewart. The District Court in Gautreaux had found that the
United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) had
maintained a racially segregated system of public housing
within the city of Chicago, in violation of various constitutional and statutory provisions. There was no indication
that the violation had produced any effects outside the city
itself. The issue before us was whether "the remedial order

of the federal trial court [might] extend beyond Chicago'sterritorial boundaries." Id., at 286. Thus, while

Justice
O'Connor suggests that Gautreaux may not have addressedthe propriety of a remedy with effects going beyond the district in which the constitutional violation had occurred, ante,at 106, her suggestion cannot be squared with our express
understanding of the question we were deciding: "the per-missibility in light of

Milliken of `inter-district relief for dis-crimination in public housing in the absence of a finding of

an inter-district violation.' " Gautreaux, supra, at 292.HUD argued that the case should turn on the same principles governing school desegregation orders and that, under
Milliken I, the District Court's order could not look beyondChicago's city limits, because it was only within those limits

that the constitutional violation had been committed. 425U. S., at 296-297. We agreed with HUD that the principles
of Milliken apply outside of the school desegregation con-text, 425 U. S., at 294, and n. 11, but squarely rejected its
restricted interpretation of those principles and its view oflimited equitable authority to remedy segregation. We held
that a district court may indeed subject a governmental per-petrator of segregative practices to an order for relief with
intended consequences beyond the perpetrator's own subdi-vision, even in the absence of effects outside that subdivision,
so long as the decree does not bind the authorities of othergovernmental units that are free of violations and segregative effects:

"[Milliken's] holding that there had to be an interdis-trict violation or effect before a federal court could order

the crossing of district boundary lines reflected the sub-stantive impact of a consolidation remedy on separate
and independent school districts. The District Court'sdesegregation order in

Milliken was held to be an im-permissible remedy not because it envisioned relief

against a wrongdoer extending beyond the city in whichthe violation occurred but because it contemplated a

judicial decree restructuring the operation of local gov-ernmental entities that were not implicated in any constitutional violation." Id., at 296 (footnote omitted).
In the face of Gautreaux's language, the Court claims thatit was only because the " `relevant geographic area for purposes of the [plaintiffs'] housing options [was] the Chicagohousing market, not the Chicago city limits,' "

ante, at 97,quoting Gautreaux, supra, at 299, that we held that " `a metropolitan area remedy . . . [was] not impermissible as a mat-ter of law,' "

ante, at 97, quoting Gautreaux, supra, at 306.See also ante, at 106 (

O'Connor, J., concurring). But thatwas only half the explanation. Requiring a remedy outside

the city in the wider metropolitan area was permissible notonly because that was the area of the housing market even
for people who lived within the city (thus relating the scopeof the remedy to the violation suffered by the victims) but
also because the trial court could order a remedy in thatmarket without binding a governmental unit innocent of the
violation and free of its effects. In "reject[ing] the conten-tion that, since HUD's constitutional and statutory violations
were committed in Chicago, Milliken precludes an orderagainst HUD that will affect its conduct in the greater metropolitan area," we stated plainly that "[t]he critical distinc-tion between HUD and the suburban school districts in
Milliken is that HUD has been found to have violated theConstitution. That violation provided the necessary predicate for the entry of a remedial order against HUD and, in-deed, imposed a duty on the District Court to grant appropriate relief." Gautreaux, 425 U. S., at 297. Having foundHUD in violation of the Constitution, the District Court was
obligated to make "every effort . . . to employ those methods[necessary] `to achieve the greatest possible degree of [relief], taking into account the practicalities of the situation,' "ibid., quoting Davis v. Board of School Comm'rs of Mobile
Cty., 402 U. S. 33, 37 (1971), and the District Court's methodscould include subjecting HUD to measures going beyond the

geographical or political boundaries of its violation. "Noth-ing in the Milliken decision suggests a per se rule that federal courts lack authority to order parties found to have vio-lated the Constitution to undertake remedial efforts beyond
the municipal boundaries of the city where the violationoccurred." 425 U. S., at 298.

On its face, the District Court's magnet school concept fallsentirely within the scope of equitable authority recognized
in Gautreaux. In Gautreaux, the fact that the CHA andHUD had the authority to operate outside the limits of the
city of Chicago meant that an order to fund or build housingbeyond those limits would "not necessarily entail coercion of
uninvolved governmental units . . . ." Id., at 298. Here, bythe same token, the District Court has not sought to "consolidate or in any way restructure" the SSD's, id., at 305-306,or, indeed, to subject them to any remedial obligation at all.

7

The District Court's remedial measures go only to the opera-tion and quality of schools within the KCMSD, and the burden of those measures accordingly falls only on the twoproven constitutional wrongdoers in this case, the KCMSD
and the State. And insofar as the District Court has or-dered those violators to undertake measures to increase the
KCMSD's attractiveness to students from other districts andthereby to reverse the flight attributable to their prior
segregative acts, its orders do not represent an abuse ofdiscretion, but instead appear "wholly commensurate with
the `nature and extent of the constitutional violation.' "
Id., at 300, quoting Milliken I, 418 U. S., at 744.The Court's failure to give Gautreaux its due points up

the risks of its approach to this case. The major peril ofaddressing an important and complex question without ade7 Thus, the Court errs in suggesting that the District Court has sought
to do here indirectly what we held the District Court could not do directly
in Milliken I. Ante, at 94. The District Court here has not attempted,
directly or indirectly, to impose any remedial measures on school districts
innocent of a constitutional violation or free from its segregative effects.

quate notice to the parties is the virtual certainty that
briefing and argument will not go to the real point. If
respondents had had reason to suspect that the validity of
applying the District Court's remedial concept of magnet
schools in this case would be the focus of consideration by
this Court, they presumably would have devoted significant
attention to Gautreaux in their briefing. As things stand,
the only references to the case in the parties' briefs were
two mere passing mentions by the Jenkins respondents and
a footnote by the State implying that Gautreaux was of little
relevance here. The State's footnote says that "in Gautreaux, there was evidence of suburban discrimination and of
the `extra-city impact of [HUD's] intracity discrimination.' "
Brief for Petitioners 28, n. 18. That statement, however, is
flatly at odds with Justice Stewart's opinion for the Court:
"the Court of Appeals surmised that either an interdistrict
violation or an interdistrict segregative effect may have been
present in this case. There is no support provided for either
conclusion. . . . [I]t is apparent that the Court of Appeals was
mistaken in supposing that the [record contains] evidence
of suburban discrimination justifying metropolitan area relief. . . . [And the Court of Appeals's] unsupported speculation
falls far short of the demonstration of a `significant segregative effect in another district' discussed in the Milliken opinion." Gautreaux, 425 U. S., at 294-295, n. 11.8

8 Justice O'Connor thinks I place undue emphasis on the Gautreaux
Court's footnote, turning it into an "island, entire of itself . . . ," ante, at
107, but it cannot be shrunk to the dimension necessary to support the
majority's result. According to Justice O'Connor, Gautreaux holds that
"territorial transgression" of any kind "is permissible only upon a showing
that [an] intradistrict constitutional violation [has] produced significant interdistrict segregative effects. . . ." Ante, at 106. She finds Gautreaux
significant only in reversing the Court of Appeals's finding that such effects had been established on the record of that case, and she understands
that the Court remanded the case to the District Court with the understanding that it would order relief going beyond the city of Chicago's

Souter, J., dissenting
After being misrepresented by the State and mentionedonly briefly by the other parties, Gautreaux's holding is now

effectively overruled, for the Court's opinion can be viewedas correct only on that assumption. But there is no apparent reason to reverse that decision, which represented thejudgment of a unanimous Court, seems to reflect equitable
common sense, and has been in the reports for two decades.While I would reserve final judgment on

Gautreaux's futureuntil a time when the subject has been given a full hearing,

boundaries only if it found significant interdistrict segregative effects to
exist. Ante, at 107-108.

But this is an implausible reading. Justice O'Connor is correct that
in Gautreaux we reiterated the importance of Milliken I's requirement of
significant interdistrict segregative effects, but we did so only in connection with the type of relief at issue in Milliken I, that involving "direct
federal judicial interference with local governmental entities" not shown
to have violated the Constitution. Gautreaux, 425 U. S., at 294; see generally id., at 292-298. As the language I have quoted above demonstrates, we made it very clear in Gautreaux that the District Court could
order relief going beyond the boundaries of the city of Chicago without
any finding of such effects, because that relief would impose no obligation
on governmental units innocent of a constitutional violation and free of its
effects. Indeed, when we summarized our holding at the conclusion of
our opinion, we made the point yet again. "In sum, there is no basis for
the petitioner's claim that court-ordered metropolitan area relief in this
case would be impermissible as a matter of law under the Milliken decision. In contrast to the desegregation order in that case, a metropolitan
area relief order directed to HUD would not consolidate or in any way
restructure local governmental units." Id., at 305-306. While Justice
O'Connor, ante, at 107-108 (and the Court, ante, at 97) seeks to make
much of the fact that we did not order metropolitan relief ourselves in
Gautreaux, but rather remanded the case to the District Court, we did so
because we recognized that the question of what relief to order was a
matter for the District Court in the first instance. "The nature and scope
of the remedial decree to be entered on remand is a matter for the District
Court in the exercise of its equitable discretion, after affording the parties
an opportunity to present their views." 425 U. S., at 306. Nowhere did
we state that before the District Court could order metropolitan area relief, it would first have to make findings of significant segregative effects
extending beyond the city of Chicago's borders.

I realize that after today's decision there may never be anoccasion for any serious examination of Gautreaux. If

things work out that way, there will doubtless be those whowill quote from Gautreaux to describe today's opinion as
"transform[ing] Milliken's principled limitation on the exer-cise of federal judicial authority into an arbitrary and mechanical shield for those found to have engaged in unconstitu-tional conduct."

Id., at 300.I respectfully dissent.

Justice Ginsburg, dissenting.
I join Justice Souter's illuminating dissent and empha-size a consideration key to this controversy.

The Court stresses that the present remedial programshave been in place for seven years.

Ante, at 102. But com-pared to more than two centuries of firmly entrenched official

discrimination, the experience with the desegregation reme-dies ordered by the District Court has been evanescent.

In 1724, Louis XV of France issued the Code Noir, the firstslave code for the Colony of Louisiana, an area that included
Missouri. Violette, The Black Code in Missouri, in 6 Proceedings of the Mississippi Valley Historical Association 287,288 (B. Shambaugh ed. 1913). When Missouri entered the

Union in 1821, it entered as a slave State. Id., at 303.Before the Civil War, Missouri law prohibited the creation
or maintenance of schools for educating blacks: "No personshall keep or teach any school for the instruction of negroes
or mulattoes, in reading or writing, in this State." Act ofFeb. 16, 1847, $ 1, 1847 Mo. Laws 103.

Beginning in 1865, Missouri passed a series of laws requiring separate public schools for blacks. See, e. g., Act of Mar.29, 1866, $ 20, 1865 Mo. Laws 177. The Missouri Constitution first permitted, then required, separate schools. SeeMo. Const., Art. IX, $ 2 (1865); Mo. Const., Art. XI, $ 3 (1875).

of Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954), Missouri's Attorney Gen515us1$67p 08-25-98 19:18:23 PAGES OPINPGT

eral declared these provisions mandating segregated schoolsunenforceable. See Jenkins v. Missouri, 593 F. Supp. 1485,

1490 (WD Mo. 1984). The statutes were repealed in 1957and the constitutional provision was rescinded in 1976.
Ibid. Nonetheless, 30 years after Brown, the District Courtfound that "the inferior education indigenous of the statecompelled dual school system has lingering effects in theKansas City, Missouri School District." 593 F. Supp., at
1492. The District Court concluded that "the State . . . can-not defend its failure to affirmatively act to eliminate the
structure and effects of its past dual system on the basis ofrestrictive state law."

Id., at 1505. Just ten years ago, inJune 1985, the District Court issued its first remedial order.

Jenkins v. Missouri, 639 F. Supp. 19 (WD Mo.).Today, the Court declares illegitimate the goal of attracting nonminority students to the Kansas City, Missouri,School District,

ante, at 94, and thus stops the DistrictCourt's efforts to integrate a school district that was, in the

1984/1985 school year, sorely in need and 68.3% black. 639F. Supp., at 36; see also

Jenkins v. Missouri, 672 F. Supp.400, 411 (WD Mo. 1987) (reporting that physical facilities in

the School District had "literally rotted"). Given the deep,inglorious history of segregation in Missouri, to curtail desegregation at this time and in this manner is an action atonce too swift and too soon. Cf. 11 F. 3d 755, 762 (CA8 1993)
(Court of Appeals noted with approval that the DistrictCourt had ordered the School District to submit plans projecting termination of court-ordered funding at alternativeintervals, running from April 1993, of three, five, seven, or,
at most, ten years).

Syllabus

RYDER v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe armed forces

No. 94-431. Argued April 18, 1995--Decided June 12, 1995
Petitioner, an enlisted member of the Coast Guard, was convicted by a

court-martial of drug offenses, and the Coast Guard Court of Military
Review affirmed. On rehearing, that court rejected petitioner's claim
that its composition violated the Appointments Clause, U. S. Const., Art.
II, $ 2, cl. 2, because two of the judges on petitioner's three-judge panel
were civilians appointed by the General Counsel of the Department of
Transportation. The Court of Military Appeals agreed with petitioner
that the appointments violated the Clause under its previous decision
in United States v. Carpenter, 37 M. J. 291, that appellate military
judges are inferior officers who must be appointed by a President, a
court of law, or a head of a department. The court nonetheless affirmed
petitioner's conviction on the ground that the actions of the two civilian
judges were valid de facto, citing Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1 (1976)
(per curiam).

Held: The Court of Military Appeals erred in according de facto validity

to the actions of the civilian judges of the Coast Guard Court of Military
Review. Pp. 180-188.

(a) The de facto officer doctrine--which confers validity upon acts
performed under the color of official title even though it is later discovered that the legality of the actor's appointment or election to office is
deficient--cannot be invoked to authorize the actions of the judges in
question. Those cases in which this Court relied upon the doctrine in
deciding criminal defendants' challenges to the authority of a judge who
participated in the proceedings leading to their conviction and sentence,
see, e. g., Ball v. United States, 140 U. S. 118, are distinguishable here
because, inter alia, petitioner's claim is that there has been a trespass
upon the constitutional power of appointment, not merely a misapplication of a statute providing for the assignment of already appointed
judges. One who makes a timely challenge to the constitutionality of
the appointment of an officer who adjudicates his case is entitled to a
decision on the merits of the question and whatever relief may be appropriate if a violation indeed occurred. Cf. Glidden Co. v. Zdanok, 370
U. S. 530, 536. Any other rule would create a disincentive to raise Appointments Clause challenges with respect to questionable judicial appointments. Buckley v. Valeo and Connor v. Williams, 404 U. S. 549,

Syllabus
which Buckley cited as authority, were civil cases that did not explicitly
rely on the de facto officer doctrine in validating the past acts of public
officials against constitutional challenges, and this Court is not inclined
to extend those cases beyond their facts. Pp. 180-184.

(b) The Court rejects the Government's several alternative defenses
of the Court of Military Appeals' decision to give its Carpenter holding
prospective application only. First, the argument that the latter court
exercised remedial discretion pursuant to Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson, 404
U. S. 97, is unavailing because there is not the sort of grave disruption
or inequity involved in awarding retrospective relief to this petitioner
that would bring the Chevron Oil doctrine into play. Nor is it persuasively argued that qualified immunity, which specially protects public
officials from damages liability for judgment calls made in a legally uncertain environment, should be extended to protect such officials from
Appointments Clause attacks, which do not involve personal damages,
but can only invalidate actions taken pursuant to defective title. Similarly, the practice of denying criminal defendants an exclusionary remedy from Fourth Amendment violations when those errors occur despite
the Government actors' good faith, United States v. Leon, 468 U. S. 897,
does not require the affirmance of petitioner's conviction, since no collateral consequence arises from rectifying an Appointments Clause violation, see id., at 907, and such rectification provides a suitable incentive
to make challenges under the Clause, see id., at 918-921. Finally, the
Government's harmless-error argument need not be considered, since it
was not raised below and there is no indication that the Court of Military Appeals determined that no harm occurred in this case. The related argument that any defect in the Court of Military Review proceedings was in effect cured by review in the Court of Military Appeals
must be rejected because of the difference in function and authority
between the two courts. Petitioner is therefore entitled to a hearing
before a properly appointed panel of the Coast Guard Court of Military
Review. Pp. 184-188.

Days, Deputy Solicitor General Dreeben, Malcolm L. Stewart, and Paul M. Geier.

Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of theCourt.

Petitioner, an enlisted member of the United States Coast
Guard, challenges his conviction by a court-martial. His
conviction was affirmed first by the Coast Guard Court ofMilitary Review, and then by the United States Court of

Military Appeals.1 The latter court agreed with petitionerthat the two civilian judges who served on the Court of Military Review had not been appointed in accordance with thedictates of the Appointments Clause, U. S. Const., Art. II,

$ 2, cl. 2, but nonetheless held that the actions of those judgeswere valid

de facto. We hold that the judges' actions were
not valid de facto.Petitioner was convicted of several drug offenses, and was

sentenced by a general court-martial to five years' confinement (later reduced to three years), forfeiture of pay, reduc-tion in grade, and a dishonorable discharge. He appealed to

the Coast Guard Court of Military Review, which, except in
one minor aspect, affirmed his conviction. 34 M. J. 1077
(1992). On request for rehearing, petitioner challenged the
composition of that court as violative of the Appointments
Clause of the Constitution because two of the judges on the
three-judge panel were civilians appointed by the General
Counsel of the Department of Transportation. The court
granted rehearing and rejected this challenge. 34 M. J.
1259 (1992).

1 The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1995, Pub. L.
103-337, $ 924, 108 Stat. 2831, changed the nomenclature for the military
appellate courts. The previous "Court[s] of Military Review" were rechristened as the "Court[s] of Criminal Appeals" and the previous "United
States Court of Military Appeals" was redesignated as the "United States
Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces." We adhere to the former names
consistent with all previous proceedings in this case.

180 RYDER v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
The Court of Military Appeals likewise affirmed petitioner's conviction, 39 M. J. 454 (1994), although it agreed with
petitioner that the appellate judges on the Coast Guard
Court of Military Review had been appointed in violation of
the Appointments Clause. The court relied for this conclusion on its previous decision in United States v. Carpenter,
37 M. J. 291 (1993), where it had decided that appellate military judges are inferior officers whose service requires appointment by a President, a court of law, or a head of a department. U. S. Const., Art. II, $ 2, cl. 2.2 Despite finding
a constitutional violation in the appointment of two judges
on petitioner's three-judge appellate panel, the Court of Military Appeals affirmed his conviction on the ground that the
actions of these judges were valid de facto, citing Buckley v.
Valeo, 424 U. S. 1 (1976) (per curiam). We granted certiorari. 513 U. S. 1071 (1995).

The de facto officer doctrine confers validity upon acts performed by a person acting under the color of official title
even though it is later discovered that the legality of that
person's appointment or election to office is deficient. Norton v. Shelby County, 118 U. S. 425, 440 (1886). "The de
facto doctrine springs from the fear of the chaos that would
result from multiple and repetitious suits challenging every
action taken by every official whose claim to office could be
open to question, and seeks to protect the public by insuring
the orderly functioning of the government despite technical
defects in title to office." 63A Am. Jur. 2d, Public Officers

2 The Appointments Clause reads in full:
"[The President] shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent
of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United
States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and
which shall be established by Law: but the Congress may by Law vest
the Appointment of such inferior Officers, as they think proper, in the
President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments."

Opinion of the Court
and Employees $ 578, pp. 1080-1081 (1984) (footnote omit-ted). The doctrine has been relied upon by this Court in

several cases involving challenges by criminal defendants tothe authority of a judge who participated in some part of the
proceedings leading to their conviction and sentence.

In Ball v. United States, 140 U. S. 118 (1891), a CircuitJudge assigned a District Judge from the Western District

of Louisiana to sit in the Eastern District of Texas as a re-placement for the resident judge who had fallen ill and who
later died. The assigned judge continued to sit until thesuccessor to the deceased judge was duly appointed. The
assigned judge had sentenced Ball after the resident judge
had died, and Ball made no objection at that time. Ball later
moved in arrest of judgment challenging the sentence imposed upon him by the assigned judge after the death of the
resident judge, but this Court held that the assigned judge
"was judge de facto if not de jure, and his acts as such are
not open to collateral attack." Id., at 128-129.

Similarly, in McDowell v. United States, 159 U. S. 596
(1895), a Circuit Judge assigned a judge from the Eastern
District of North Carolina to sit as a District Judge in the
District of South Carolina until a vacancy in the latter district was filled. McDowell was indicted and convicted during the term in which the assigned judge served, but made
no objection at the time of his indictment or trial. He later
challenged the validity of his conviction because of a claimed
error in the assigned judge's designation. This Court decided that the assigned judge was a "judge de facto," and
that "his actions as such, so far as they affect third persons,
are not open to question." Id., at 601. The Court further
observed that McDowell's claim "presents a mere matter of
statutory construction . . . . It involves no trespass upon
the executive power of appointment." Id., at 598. In a
later case, Ex parte Ward, 173 U. S. 452 (1899), petitioner
sought an original writ of habeas corpus to challenge the
authority of the District Judge who had sentenced him on

515us1$68h 08-13-98 12:34:06 PAGES OPINPGT
182 RYDER v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
the grounds that the appointment of the judge during a Sen-ate recess was improper. This Court held that "the title of

a person acting with color of authority, even if he be not agood officer in point of law, cannot be collaterally attacked."
Id., at 456.

In the case before us, petitioner challenged the composi-tion of the Coast Guard Court of Military Review while his

case was pending before that court on direct review. Unlikethe defendants in

Ball, McDowell, and Ward, petitioner
raised his objection to the judges' titles before those veryjudges and prior to their action on his case. And his claim

is based on the Appointments Clause of Article II of the
Constitution--a claim that there has been a "trespass upon
the executive power of appointment," McDowell, supra, at
598, rather than a misapplication of a statute providing for
the assignment of already appointed judges to serve in
other districts.

In Buckley v. Valeo, supra, at 125, we said "[t]he Appointments Clause could, of course, be read as merely dealing with
etiquette or protocol in describing `Officers of the United
States' but the drafters had a less frivolous purpose in
mind." The Clause is a bulwark against one branch aggrandizing its power at the expense of another branch, but it
is more: it "preserves another aspect of the Constitution's
structural integrity by preventing the diffusion of the
appointment power." Freytag v. Commissioner, 501 U. S.
868, 878 (1991). In Glidden Co. v. Zdanok, 370 U. S. 530
(1962), we declined to invoke the de facto officer doctrine in
order to avoid deciding a question arising under Article III
of the Constitution, saying that the cases in which we had
relied on that doctrine did not involve "basic constitutional
protections designed in part for the benefit of litigants."
Id., at 536 (plurality opinion). We think that one who makes
a timely challenge to the constitutional validity of the appointment of an officer who adjudicates his case is entitled
to a decision on the merits of the question and whatever

relief may be appropriate if a violation indeed occurred.Any other rule would create a disincentive to raise Appointments Clause challenges with respect to questionable judi-cial appointments.

The Court of Military Appeals relied, not without reason,
on our decision in Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1 (1976).There, plaintiffs challenged the appointment of the Federal

Election Commission members on separation-of-powersgrounds. The Court agreed with them and held that the
appointment of four members of the Commission by Con-gress, rather than the President, violated the Appointments
Clause. It nonetheless quite summarily held that the "past
acts of the Commission are therefore accorded de facto validity." Id., at 142. We cited as authority for this determination Connor v. Williams, 404 U. S. 549, 550-551 (1972), in
which we held that legislative acts performed by legislators
held to have been elected in accordance with an unconstitutional apportionment were not therefore void.

Neither Buckley nor Connor explicitly relied on the de
facto officer doctrine, though the result reached in each case
validated the past acts of public officials. But in Buckley,
the constitutional challenge raised by the plaintiffs was decided in their favor, and the declaratory and injunctive relief
they sought was awarded to them. And Connor, like other
voting rights cases, see Allen v. State Bd. of Elections, 393
U. S. 544, 572 (1969); Cipriano v. City of Houma, 395 U. S.
701 (1969) (per curiam), did not involve a defect in a specific
officer's title, but rather a challenge to the composition of an
entire legislative body. The Court assumed, arguendo, that
an equal protection violation infected the District Court's
reapportionment plan, declined to invalidate the elections
that had already occurred, and reserved judgment on the
propriety of the prospective relief requested by petitioners
pending completion of further District Court proceedings
that could rectify any constitutional violation present in the
court-ordered redistricting plan. Connor, supra, at 550-

Opinion of the Court
551. To the extent these civil cases may be thought to haveimplicitly applied a form of the de facto officer doctrine, we

are not inclined to extend them beyond their facts.3The Government alternatively defends the decision of the
Court of Military Appeals on the grounds that it was, forseveral reasons, proper for that court to give its decision in
Carpenter--holding that the appointment of the civilianjudges to the Coast Guard Court of Military Review violated
the Appointments Clause--prospective application only. Itfirst argues that the Court of Military Appeals exercised remedial discretion pursuant to Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson, 404U. S. 97 (1971).

4 But whatever the continuing validity of

3 For similar reasons, we do not find instructive the Court's disposition
of petitioner's challenge in Northern Pipeline Constr. Co. v. Marathon
Pipe Line Co., 458 U. S. 50 (1982). The Court declared the broad grant of
jurisdiction to Article I bankruptcy courts unconstitutional and applied its
decision prospectively only. Id., at 88. But in doing so, it affirmed the
judgment of the District Court, which had dismissed petitioner's bankruptcy action and afforded respondent the relief requested pursuant to its
constitutional challenge. Id., at 57. So Northern Pipeline is not a case
in which the Court invoked the de facto officer doctrine to deny relief to
the party before it and therefore does not support the Government in
this case.

4 The Government advances a virtual cornucopia of factors more or less

peculiar to this case which it says validate the Court of Military Appeals'
exercise of discretion in this case and thus support affirmance. It points
to the lack of any substantial impact that the improper appointments had
on petitioner's appeal, to the lack of any constitutional right to appellate
review, and to the deference owed the military and the public interest in
avoiding disruption of that system. Brief for United States 22. At oral
argument, it also contended that subsequent action taken by the Secretary
of Transportation to cure the Appointments Clause error, the fact that
petitioner's underlying claims of error were meritless, and the fact that
the civilian judges in this case had previously served under proper appointments while on active duty were relevant criteria. Tr. of Oral Arg.
29-30, 33-34. The substance, if not the form, of several of these arguments is discussed and rejected in the text. Those that are not discussed
are alternative grounds for affirmance which the Government did not raise
below, see Answer to Supplement for Petition for Review in No. 68449 (Ct.
Mil. App.), pp. 2-4, and which we decline to reach. Jenkins v. Anderson,

Chevron Oil after Harper v. Virginia Dept. of Taxation, 509U. S. 86 (1993), and Reynoldsville Casket Co. v. Hyde, 514

U. S. 749 (1995), there is not the sort of grave disruptionor inequity involved in awarding retrospective relief to this
petitioner that would bring that doctrine into play. Theparties agree that the defective appointments of the civilian
judges affect only between 7 to 10 cases pending on directreview. As for the Government's concern that a flood of
habeas corpus petitions will ensue, precedent provides littlebasis for such fears.

Ex parte Ward, 173 U. S. 452 (1899).Nor does the Government persuade us that the inquiry

into clearly established law as it pertains to qualified immu-nity counsels in favor of discretion to deny a remedy in this
case. Qualified immunity specially protects public officialsfrom the specter of damages liability for judgment calls
made in a legally uncertain environment. Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800, 806 (1982) ("[O]ur decisions consistentlyhave held that government officials are entitled to some form

of immunity from suits for damages" (emphasis added)).Providing relief to a claimant raising an Appointments
Clause challenge does not subject public officials to personaldamages that represent a "potentially disabling threa[t] of
liability," but only invalidates actions taken pursuant to de-fective title. The qualified immunity doctrine need not be
extended to protect public officials from such attacks.Similarly, the practice of denying criminal defendants an
exclusionary remedy from Fourth Amendment violationswhen those errors occur despite the good faith of the Government actors, United States v. Leon, 468 U. S. 897 (1984), doesnot require the affirmance of petitioner's conviction in this
case. Finding the deterrent remedy of suppression not com-pelled by the Fourth Amendment, id., at 910, that case specifically relied on the "objectionable collateral consequenceof [the] interference with the criminal justice system's

truth-finding function" in requiring a blanket exclusionaryremedy for all violations,

id., at 907, and the relative ineffectiveness of such remedy to deter future Fourth Amendmentviolations in particular cases,

id., at 918-921. No similar
collateral consequence arises from rectifying an Appointments Clause violation, and correcting Appointments Clauseviolations in cases such as this one provides a suitable incentive to make such challenges.The Government finally suggests that the Court of Military Appeals applied something akin to a harmless-errordoctrine in affirming petitioner's conviction, refusing to redress the violation because petitioner suffered no adverse
consequences from the composition of the court. Brief for
United States 33. The Government did not argue below
that the error, assuming it occurred, was harmless, and there
is no indication from the Court of Military Appeals' summary
disposition of this issue that it determined that no harm occurred in this case. We therefore need not address whether
the alleged defects in the composition of petitioner's appellate panel are susceptible to harmless-error review. The
Government also argues, at least obliquely, that whatever
defect there may have been in the proceedings before the
Coast Guard Court of Military Review was in effect cured
by the review available to petitioner in the Court of Military
Appeals. Id., at 24, n. 16. Again, because of the hierarchical nature of sentence review in the system of military
courts, we need not address whether this defect is susceptible to the cure envisioned by the Government.

UCMJ, 10 U. S. C. $ 866(c).5The court of last resort in the military justice system is
the Court of Military Appeals. Five civilian judges ap-pointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate constitute the court. Art. 142, UCMJ, 10 U. S. C. $ 942 (1988 ed.,Supp. V). The court grants review in cases decided by the
Courts of Military Review "upon petition of the accused andon good cause shown." Art. 67, UCMJ, 10 U. S. C. $ 867(a)
(1988 ed., Supp. V). The scope of review is narrower than
the review exercised by the Court of Military Review; solong as there is some competent evidence in the record to

establish the elements of an offense beyond a reasonabledoubt, the Court of Military Appeals will not reevaluate the
facts. United States v. Wilson, 6 M. J. 214 (1979).Examining the difference in function and authority between the Coast Guard Court of Military Review and theCourt of Military Appeals, it is quite clear that the former
had broader discretion to review claims of error, revise factual determinations, and revise sentences than did the latter.It simply cannot be said, therefore, that review by the properly constituted Court of Military Appeals gave petitionerall the possibility for relief that review by a properly constituted Coast Guard Court of Military Review would have

CITY OF MILWAUKEE v. CEMENT DIVISION,NATIONAL GYPSUM CO.,

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe seventh circuit

No. 94-788. Argued April 24, 1995--Decided June 12, 1995
After a ship owned by the Cement Division of National Gypsum Co. and

insured by the other respondents sank in a winter storm while berthed
in a slip owned by petitioner Milwaukee (City), National Gypsum
brought this admiralty suit for damages, alleging that the City had negligently breached its duty as a wharfinger. The City denied fault and
filed a counterclaim for damage to its dock, alleging that National Gypsum was negligent in leaving the ship virtually unmanned. During the
course of the litigation, the District Court, inter alia, found that both
parties were negligent and apportioned liability primarily to National
Gypsum; entered a partial judgment for the stipulated amount of respondents' damages, excluding prejudgment interest; and denied respondents' request for such interest, holding that the fact that National
Gypsum's loss was primarily attributable to its own negligence and the
existence of a genuine dispute over the City's liability were special circumstances justifying a departure from the general rule that prejudgment interest should be awarded in maritime collision cases. The
Court of Appeals disagreed and reversed the latter ruling, holding,
among other things, that mutual fault cannot provide a basis for denying
prejudgment interest after this Court, in United States v. Reliable
Transfer Co., 421 U. S. 397, announced a rule requiring that damages be
assessed on the basis of proportionate fault when such an allocation can
reasonably be made.

Held: Neither a good-faith dispute over liability nor the existence of mutual fault justifies the denial of prejudgment interest in an admiralty
collision case. Throughout history, such cases have established a general rule that prejudgment interest should be awarded, subject to a
limited exception for "peculiar" or "exceptional" circumstances. The
existence of a legitimate difference of opinion on the liability issue is
not such a circumstance, but is merely a characteristic of most ordinary
lawsuits. Nor does the magnitude of the plaintiff's fault qualify as a
"peculiar" feature. Although it might appear somewhat inequitable to
award a large sum in prejudgment interest against a relatively innocent
party, any unfairness is illusory, because the relative fault of the parties

has already been taken into consideration under the Reliable Transfer
rule in calculating the amount of the loss for which the relatively innocent party is responsible. In light of Reliable Transfer, a denial of prejudgment interest on the basis of mutual fault would unfairly penalize
a party twice for the same mistake. Pp. 194-199.

31 F. 3d 581, affirmed.

Stevens, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which all other Members joined, except Breyer, J., who took no part in the consideration or
decision of the case.

David A. Strauss argued the cause for petitioner. With
him on the briefs were Grant F. Langley, Rudolph M. Konrad, and Michael Sturley.

Harney B. Stover, Jr., argued the cause and filed a brief
for respondents.

Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court.
This is an admiralty case in which the plaintiff 's loss was
primarily attributable to its own negligence. The question
presented is whether that fact, together with the existence of
a genuine dispute over liability, justified the District Court's
departure from the general rule that prejudgment interest
should be awarded in maritime collision cases.

I
Respondents are the owner and the insurers of the E. M.
Ford, a ship that sank in Milwaukee's outer harbor on Christmas Eve 1979. At the time of this disaster, the Ford was
berthed in a slip owned by the city of Milwaukee (City). In
the course of a severe storm, she broke loose from her moorings, battered against the headwall of the slip, took on water,
and sank. She was subsequently raised and repaired.

In 1980 the Ford's owner, the Cement Division of National
Gypsum Co. (National Gypsum), brought suit against the
City, invoking the District Court's admiralty and maritime

Opinion of the Court
jurisdiction.1 The complaint alleged that the City hadbreached its duty as a wharfinger by assigning the vessel to

a berthing slip known to be unsafe in heavy winds and byfailing to give adequate warning of hidden dangers in the
slip. The plaintiff sought damages of $4.5 million, later in-creased to $6.5 million. The City denied fault and filed a
$250,000 counterclaim for damage to its dock. The City al-leged that National Gypsum was negligent in leaving the
ship virtually unmanned in winter, with no means aboard formonitoring weather conditions or summoning help.

In 1986 the District Court conducted a 3-week trial on theissue of liability. Finding that both National Gypsum and
the City had been negligent, the court determined that theowner bore 96% of the responsibility for the disaster, while
the City bore 4% of the fault. Given the disparity in theparties' damages, a final judgment giving effect to that allocation (and awarding the damages sought in the pleadings)would have essentially left each party to bear its own losses.

Respondents took an interlocutory appeal from the Dis-trict Court's ruling.

2 The Court of Appeals for the Seventh

Circuit agreed with the District Court's conclusion that bothparties were at fault, and that the owner's negligence was

"more egregious" than the City's, but it rejected the alloca-tion of 96% of the responsibility to the owner as clearly erroneous. Cement Div., National Gypsum Co. v. Milwaukee,915 F. 2d 1154, 1159 (1990), cert. denied, 499 U. S. 960 (1991).
After making its own analysis of the record, the Court of

Opinion of the Court
Appeals apportioned liability two-thirds to National Gypsumand one-third to the City. 915 F. 2d, at 1160.

Thereafter the parties entered into a partial settlementfixing respondents' damages, excluding prejudgment interest, at $1,677,541.86.3 The parties agreed that any claim forinterest would be submitted to the District Court for decision. A partial judgment for the stipulated amount was en-tered and satisfied.

Respondents then sought an award of over $5.3 million inprejudgment interest.

4 The District Court denied respondents' request. It noted that "an award of prejudgment in-terest calculated from the date of the loss is the rule rather

than the exception in cases brought under a district court'sadmiralty jurisdiction," App. to Pet. for Cert. 21a, but held
that special circumstances justified a departure from thatrule in this case. The court explained:

"In the instant case the record shows that from theoutset there has been a genuine dispute over [respondents'] good faith claim that the City of Milwaukee wasnegligent for failing to warn the agents of [National

3 In arriving at this sum, the parties agreed that respondents' damages
were slightly more than $5.4 million, while the City's damages were just
over $192,000. The parties multiplied respondents' damages by one-third,
resulting in a subtotal of $1,805,829.98 for which the City was responsible.
From this subtotal, the parties subtracted two-thirds of the City's damages, or $128,288.12, as an offset because that was the amount of National
Gypsum's responsibility. The difference was the City's obligation to respondents. App. 40-45.

4 This figure was based on respondents' assertion that prejudgment interest should be compounded continuously, from the time of the sinking of
the Ford, at the commercial prime rate of interest averaged over the period of assessment. Plaintiff's Brief on Issue of Prejudgment Interest in
No. 80-C-1001 (ED Wis.), pp. 24-26. The District Court did not express
any view on the correctness of this analysis, nor do we. We merely note
in passing that the discrepancy between the damages award and the interest sought by National Gypsum is in some measure attributable to the
delays that have plagued this litigation--a factor that does not appear to
be traceable to the fault of any party.

Gypsum] (who were planning to leave the FORD un-manned during the Christmas holidays) that a winter

storm could create conditions in the outer harbor at Mil-waukee which could damage the ship. The trial court
and the court of appeals both found mutual fault for thedamage which ensued to the ship and to the [City's]
dock. The court of appeals ascribed two-thirds of thenegligence to [National Gypsum]. Thus, in this situation the court concludes that [National Gypsum's] con-tributory negligence was of such magnitude that an
award of prejudgment interest would be inequitable."
Id., at 22a.5

The Court of Appeals reversed. 31 F. 3d 581 (1994). Itnoted that prior to this Court's announcement of the comparative fault rule in United States v. Reliable Transfer Co., 421U. S. 397 (1975), some courts had denied prejudgment interest in order to mitigate the harsh effects of the earlier rulecommanding an equal division of damages whenever a collision resulted from the fault of both parties, even though oneparty was only slightly negligent. In the court's view, however, after the divided damages rule was "thrown over-board" and replaced with comparative fault, mutual fault
could no longer provide a basis for denying prejudgment in-terest. 31 F. 3d, at 584-585. The Court of Appeals also
read our decision in West Virginia v. United States, 479 U. S.305, 311, n. 3 (1987), as disapproving of a "balancing of the
equities" as a method of deciding whether to allow prejudg-ment interest. 31 F. 3d, at 585.

The Court of Appeals' decision deepened an existing Cir-cuit split regarding the criteria for denying prejudgment interest in maritime collision cases. Compare, e. g., Inland

5 The District Court also relied on the City's status as a municipality as
an alternative ground for denying prejudgment interest. App. to Pet. for
Cert. 22a-23a. The Court of Appeals rejected this portion of the District
Court's analysis as inconsistent with Circuit precedent, and the City did
not pursue the argument in this Court.

II
Although Congress has enacted a statute governing theaward of postjudgment interest in federal court litigation,

see 28 U. S. C. $ 1961, there is no comparable legislation re-garding prejudgment interest. Far from indicating a legislative determination that prejudgment interest should notbe awarded, however, the absence of a statute merely indicates that the question is governed by traditional judge-made principles.

Monessen Southwestern R. Co. v. Morgan,486 U. S. 330, 336-337 (1988);

Rodgers v. United States, 332U. S. 371, 373 (1947). Those principles are well developed in

admiralty, where "the Judiciary has traditionally taken thelead in formulating flexible and fair remedies." Reliable
Transfer, 421 U. S., at 409.Throughout our history, admiralty decrees have included
provisions for prejudgment interest. In Del Col v. Arnold,3 Dall. 333, a prize case decided in 1796, we affirmed a decree
awarding the libellant interest from "the day of capture."
Id., at 334. In The Amiable Nancy, 3 Wheat. 546 (1818),we considered a similar decree. In augmenting the damages

awarded by the lower court, we directed that the additionalfunds should bear prejudgment interest, as had the damages
already awarded by the lower court. Id., at 562-563. The
Amiable Nancy arose out of the "gross and wanton" seizureof a Haitian vessel near the island of Antigua by the Scourge,

an American privateer. Id., at 546-547, 558. In his opinionfor the Court, Justice Story explained that even though the
"loss of the supposed profits" of the Amiable Nancy's voyagewas not recoverable, "the prime cost, or value of the prop515us1$69i 08-11-98 18:40:25 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
erty lost, at the time of the loss, and in case of injury, thediminution in value, by reason of the injury, with interest

upon such valuation, afforded the true measure for assess-ing damages." Id., at 560 (emphasis added). We applied
the same rule in The Umbria, 166 U. S. 404, 421 (1897), ex-plaining that "in cases of total loss by collision damages are
limited to the value of the vessel, with interest thereon, andthe net freight pending at the time of the collision." (Emphasis added.)6The Courts of Appeals have consistently and correctly construed decisions such as these as establishing a general rulethat prejudgment interest should be awarded in maritime
collision cases, subject to a limited exception for "peculiar"or "exceptional" circumstances. See,

e. g., Inland Oil &Transport Co., 696 F. 2d, at 327; Central Rivers Towing, Inc.

v. Beardstown, 750 F. 2d 565, 574 (CA7 1984); Ohio River Co.v.

Peavey Co., 731 F. 2d 547, 549 (CA8 1984); Alkmeon Na-viera, 633 F. 2d, at 797; Parker Towing Co. v. Yazoo River

Towing, Inc., 794 F. 2d 591, 594 (CA11 1986).The essential rationale for awarding prejudgment interest
is to ensure that an injured party is fully compensated forits loss.

7 Full compensation has long been recognized as a

6 See also The Anna Maria, 2 Wheat. 327, 335 (1817) (Marshall, C. J.)
(remanding with instructions to ascertain damages suffered by the libellants, "in doing which, the value of the vessel, and the prime cost of the
cargo, with all charges, and the premium of insurance, where it has been
paid, with interest, are to be allowed") (emphasis added); The Manitoba,
122 U. S. 97, 101 (1887) (approving, in dicta, allowance of "interest on the
damages from the date of the collision to the date of the decree").

7 We have recognized the compensatory nature of prejudgment interest

in a number of cases decided outside the admiralty context. E. g., West
Virginia v. United States, 479 U. S. 305, 310-311, n. 2 (1987); Funkhouser
v. J. B. Preston Co., 290 U. S. 163, 168 (1933); Miller v. Robertson, 266 U. S.

for money withheld, but is given in response to considerations of fairness' ") (quoting Board of Comm'rs of Jackson Cty. v. United States, 308
U. S. 343, 352 (1939)).

basic principle of admiralty law, where "[r]estitutio in inte-grum is the leading maxim applied by admiralty courts to

ascertain damages resulting from a collision." Standard OilCo. of N. J. v. Southern Pacific Co., 268 U. S. 146, 158 (1925)
(citing The Baltimore, 8 Wall. 377, 385 (1869)). By compen-sating "for the loss of use of money due as damages from
the time the claim accrues until judgment is entered," West
Virginia, 479 U. S., at 310-311, n. 2, an award of prejudg-ment interest helps achieve the goal of restoring a party to

the condition it enjoyed before the injury occurred, The Pres-ident Madison, 91 F. 2d 835, 845-846 (CA9 1937).

Despite admiralty's traditional hospitality to prejudgmentinterest, however, such an award has never been automatic.
In The Scotland, 118 U. S. 507, 518-519 (1886), we statedthat the "allowance of interest on damages is not an absolute
right. Whether it ought or ought not to be allowed dependsupon the circumstances of each case, and rests very much in
the discretion of the tribunal which has to pass upon thesubject, whether it be a court or a jury." See also

The Maggie J. Smith, 123 U. S. 349, 356 (1887). Although we havenever attempted to exhaustively catalog the circumstances

Opinion of the Court
over its liability for respondents' loss. In our view, how-ever, this fact carries little weight. If interest were

awarded as a penalty for bad-faith conduct of the litigation,the City's argument would be well taken. But prejudgment
interest is not awarded as a penalty; it is merely an elementof just compensation.

The City's "good-faith" argument has some resonance withthe venerable common-law rule that prejudgment interest
is not awarded on unliquidated claims (those where the pre-cise amount of damages at issue cannot be computed). If a
party contests liability in good faith, it will usually be thecase that the party's ultimate exposure is uncertain. But
the liquidated/unliquidated distinction has faced trenchantcriticism for a number of years.

9 Moreover, that distinction

"has never become so firmly entrenched in admiralty as ithas been at law."

Moore-McCormack Lines, Inc. v. Richardson, 295 F. 2d 583, 592 (CA2 1961).10 Any fixed ruleallowing prejudgment interest only on liquidated claims

would be difficult, if not impossible, to reconcile with admi-ralty's traditional presumption. Yet unless we were willing
to adopt such a rule--which we are not--uncertainty aboutthe outcome of a case should not preclude an award of
interest.

9 "It has been recognized that a distinction, in this respect, simply as
between cases of liquidated and unliquidated damages, is not a sound one."

198 MILWAUKEE v. CEMENT DIV., NATIONAL GYPSUM CO.

Opinion of the Court
In sum, the existence of a legitimate difference of opinionon the issue of liability is merely a characteristic of most

ordinary lawsuits. It is not an extraordinary circumstancethat can justify denying prejudgment interest. See Alkmeon Naviera, 633 F. 2d, at 798.The second purportedly "peculiar" feature of this case is
the magnitude of the plaintiff 's fault. Leaving aside the em-pirical question whether such a division of fault is in fact an
aberration, it is true in this case that the owner of the E. M.
Ford was primarily responsible for the vessel's loss. As aresult, it might appear somewhat inequitable to award a

large sum in prejudgment interest against a relatively inno-cent party. But any unfairness is illusory, because the relative fault of the parties has already been taken into consider-ation in calculating the amount of the loss for which the City
is responsible.In

United States v. Reliable Transfer Co., 421 U. S. 397(1975), we "replaced the divided damages rule, which required an equal division of property damage whatever therelative degree of fault may have been, with a rule requiring
that damages be assessed on the basis of proportionate faultwhen such an allocation can reasonably be made."

McDer-mott, Inc. v. AmClyde, 511 U. S. 202, 207 (1994). Thus, in

this case, before prejudgment interest even entered the pic-ture, the total amount of respondents' recovery had already
been reduced by two-thirds because of National Gypsum'sown negligence. The City's responsibility for the remaining
one-third is no different than if it had performed the samenegligent acts and the owner, instead of also being negligent,
had engaged in heroic maneuvers that avoided two-thirds ofthe damages. The City is merely required to compensate
the owner for the loss for which the City is responsible.11

11 Indeed, although the amount is relatively small in this case, the City's
counterclaim was resolved under the same principle. Notwithstanding its
contributory negligence, the City has been compensated for two-thirds of
its cost of repairing the dock and headwall. See n. 3, supra.

Opinion of the Court
In light of Reliable Transfer, we are unmoved by theCity's contention that an award of prejudgment interest is

inequitable in a mutual fault situation. Indeed, the converseis true: a denial of prejudgment interest would be unfair.
As Justice Kennedy noted while he was sitting on theNinth Circuit, "under any rule allowing apportionment of liability, denying prejudgment interest on the basis of mutualfault would seem to penalize a party twice for the same mistake." Alkmeon Naviera, 633 F. 2d, at 798, n. 12. Such adouble penalty is commended neither by logic nor by fairness; the rule giving rise to it is a relic of history thathas ceased to serve any purpose in the wake of

Reliable
Transfer.Accordingly, we hold that neither a good-faith dispute over

liability nor the existence of mutual fault justifies the denialof prejudgment interest in an admiralty collision case.
Questions related to the calculation of the prejudgment in-terest award, including the rate to be applied, have not been
raised in this Court and remain open for consideration, inthe first instance, by the District Court.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is

Affirmed.

Justice Breyer took no part in the consideration ordecision of this case.

ADARAND CONSTRUCTORS, INC. v. PENA,SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION,

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe tenth circuit

No. 93-1841. Argued January 17, 1995--Decided June 12, 1995
Most federal agency contracts must contain a subcontractor compensation

clause, which gives a prime contractor a financial incentive to hire subcontractors certified as small businesses controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and requires the contractor to presume that such individuals include minorities or any other individuals
found to be disadvantaged by the Small Business Administration (SBA).
The prime contractor under a federal highway construction contract
containing such a clause awarded a subcontract to a company that was
certified as a small disadvantaged business. The record does not reveal
how the company obtained its certification, but it could have been by
any one of three routes: under one of two SBA programs--known as the
8(a) and 8(d) programs--or by a state agency under relevant Department of Transportation regulations. Petitioner Adarand Constructors,
Inc., which submitted the low bid on the subcontract but was not a
certified business, filed suit against respondent federal officials, claiming
that the race-based presumptions used in subcontractor compensation
clauses violate the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause. The District Court granted respondents
summary judgment. In affirming, the Court of Appeals assessed the
constitutionality of the federal race-based action under a lenient standard, resembling intermediate scrutiny, which it determined was required by Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U. S. 448, and Metro Broadcasting,
Inc. v. FCC, 497 U. S. 547.

Held: The judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded.
16 F. 3d 1537, vacated and remanded.

Justice O'Connor delivered an opinion with respect to Parts I, II,
III-A, III-B, III-D, and IV, which was for the Court except insofar as
it might be inconsistent with the views expressed in Justice Scalia's
concurrence, concluding that:

1. Adarand has standing to seek forward-looking relief. It has met
the requirements necessary to maintain its claim by alleging an invasion
of a legally protected interest in a particularized manner, and by showing that it is very likely to bid, in the relatively near future, on another
Government contract offering financial incentives to a prime contractor

for hiring disadvantaged subcontractors. See Lujan v. Defenders of
Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 560. Pp. 210-212.

2. All racial classifications, imposed by whatever federal, state, or
local governmental actor, must be analyzed by a reviewing court under
strict scrutiny. Pp. 212-231; 235-239.

(a) In Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469, a majority of
the Court held that the Fourteenth Amendment requires strict scrutiny
of all race-based action by state and local governments. While Croson
did not consider what standard of review the Fifth Amendment requires
for such action taken by the Federal Government, the Court's cases
through Croson had established three general propositions with respect
to governmental racial classifications. First, skepticism: " `Any preference based on racial or ethnic criteria must necessarily receive a most
searching examination,' " Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Ed., 476 U. S. 267,
273-274. Second, consistency: "[T]he standard of review under the
Equal Protection Clause is not dependent on the race of those burdened
or benefited by a particular classification," Croson, supra, at 494. And
third, congruence: "Equal protection analysis in the Fifth Amendment
area is the same as that under the Fourteenth Amendment," Buckley v.
Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 93. Taken together, these propositions lead to the
conclusion that any person, of whatever race, has the right to demand
that any governmental actor subject to the Constitution justify any
racial classification subjecting that person to unequal treatment under
the strictest judicial scrutiny. Pp. 212-225.

(b) However, a year after Croson, the Court, in Metro Broadcasting, upheld two federal race-based policies against a Fifth Amendment
challenge. The Court repudiated the long-held notion that "it would be
unthinkable that the same Constitution would impose a lesser duty on
the Federal Government" than it does on a State to afford equal protection of the laws, Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U. S. 497, 500, by holding that
congressionally mandated "benign" racial classifications need only satisfy intermediate scrutiny. By adopting that standard, Metro Broadcasting departed from prior cases in two significant respects. First, it
turned its back on Croson's explanation that strict scrutiny of governmental racial classifications is essential because it may not always be
clear that a so-called preference is in fact benign. Second, it squarely
rejected one of the three propositions established by this Court's earlier
cases, namely, congruence between the standards applicable to federal
and state race-based action, and in doing so also undermined the other
two. Pp. 225-227.

(c) The propositions undermined by Metro Broadcasting all derive
from the basic principle that the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments
protect persons, not groups. It follows from that principle that all gov515us1$70z 08-25-98 19:19:32 PAGES OPINPGT
202 ADARAND CONSTRUCTORS, INC. v. PENA

Syllabus
ernmental action based on race--a group classification long recognized
as in most circumstances irrelevant and therefore prohibited--should be
subjected to detailed judicial inquiry to ensure that the personal right
to equal protection has not been infringed. Thus, strict scrutiny is the
proper standard for analysis of all racial classifications, whether imposed
by a federal, state, or local actor. To the extent that Metro Broadcasting is inconsistent with that holding, it is overruled. Pp. 227-231.

(d) The decision here makes explicit that federal racial classifications, like those of a State, must serve a compelling governmental interest, and must be narrowly tailored to further that interest. Thus, to
the extent that Fullilove held federal racial classifications to be subject
to a less rigorous standard, it is no longer controlling. Requiring strict
scrutiny is the best way to ensure that courts will consistently give
racial classifications a detailed examination, as to both ends and means.
It is not true that strict scrutiny is strict in theory, but fatal in fact.
Government is not disqualified from acting in response to the unhappy
persistence of both the practice and the lingering effects of racial discrimination against minority groups in this country. When race-based
action is necessary to further a compelling interest, such action is within
constitutional constraints if it satisfies the "narrow tailoring" test set
out in this Court's previous cases. Pp. 235-237.

3. Because this decision alters the playing field in some important
respects, the case is remanded to the lower courts for further consideration. The Court of Appeals did not decide whether the interests
served by the use of subcontractor compensation clauses are properly
described as "compelling." Nor did it address the question of narrow
tailoring in terms of this Court's strict scrutiny cases. Unresolved
questions also remain concerning the details of the complex regulatory
regimes implicated by the use of such clauses. Pp. 237-238.

Justice Scalia agreed that strict scrutiny must be applied to racial
classifications imposed by all governmental actors, but concluded that
government can never have a "compelling interest" in discriminating on
the basis of race in order to "make up" for past racial discrimination in
the opposite direction. Under the Constitution there can be no such
thing as either a creditor or a debtor race. We are just one race in the
eyes of government. P. 239.

fore vacate the Court of Appeals' judgment and remand thecase for further proceedings.

I
In 1989, the Central Federal Lands Highway Division(CFLHD), which is part of the United States Department

of Transportation (DOT), awarded the prime contract fora highway construction project in Colorado to Mountain
Gravel & Construction Company. Mountain Gravel then so-licited bids from subcontractors for the guardrail portion of
the contract. Adarand, a Colorado-based highway construc-tion company specializing in guardrail work, submitted the
low bid. Gonzales Construction Company also submitted abid.

The prime contract's terms provide that Mountain Gravelwould receive additional compensation if it hired subcontractors certified as small businesses controlled by "socially andeconomically disadvantaged individuals," App. 24. Gonzales
is certified as such a business; Adarand is not. MountainGravel awarded the subcontract to Gonzales, despite Adarand's low bid, and Mountain Gravel's Chief Estimator hassubmitted an affidavit stating that Mountain Gravel would
have accepted Adarand's bid, had it not been for the addi-tional payment it received by hiring Gonzales instead.

Id.,at 28-31. Federal law requires that a subcontracting clause

similar to the one used here must appear in most federalagency contracts, and it also requires the clause to state that
"[t]he contractor shall presume that socially and economi-cally disadvantaged individuals include Black Americans,
Hispanic Americans, Native Americans, Asian Pacific Ameri-cans, and other minorities, or any other individual found to
be disadvantaged by the [Small Business] Administration
pursuant to section 8(a) of the Small Business Act." 15U. S. C. $$ 637(d)(2), (3). Adarand claims that the presumption set forth in that statute discriminates on the basis of

206 ADARAND CONSTRUCTORS, INC. v. PENA

Opinion of the Court
race in violation of the Federal Government's Fifth Amend-ment obligation not to deny anyone equal protection of the

laws.These fairly straightforward facts implicate a complex
scheme of federal statutes and regulations, to which we now
turn. The Small Business Act (Act), 72 Stat. 384, asamended, 15 U. S. C. $ 631

et seq., declares it to be "the policy
of the United States that small business concerns, [and] smallbusiness concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, . . . shall have the maxi-mum practicable opportunity to participate in the performance of contracts let by any Federal agency." $ 8(d)(1), 15
U. S. C. $ 637(d)(1). The Act defines "socially disadvantaged
individuals" as "those who have been subjected to racial or
ethnic prejudice or cultural bias because of their identity as
a member of a group without regard to their individual qualities," $ 8(a)(5), 15 U. S. C. $ 637(a)(5), and it defines "economically disadvantaged individuals" as "those socially disadvantaged individuals whose ability to compete in the free
enterprise system has been impaired due to diminished capital and credit opportunities as compared to others in the
same business area who are not socially disadvantaged."

$ 8(a)(6)(A), 15 U. S. C. $ 637(a)(6)(A).

In furtherance of the policy stated in $ 8(d)(1), the Act establishes "[t]he Government-wide goal for participation by
small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and
economically disadvantaged individuals" at "not less than 5
percent of the total value of all prime contract and subcontract awards for each fiscal year." 15 U. S. C. $ 644(g)(1).
It also requires the head of each federal agency to set
agency-specific goals for participation by businesses controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. Ibid.

The Small Business Administration (SBA) has implemented these statutory directives in a variety of ways, two
of which are relevant here. One is the "8(a) program,"

207Cite as: 515 U. S. 200 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
which is available to small businesses controlled by sociallyand economically disadvantaged individuals as the SBA has

defined those terms. The 8(a) program confers a wide rangeof benefits on participating businesses, see,

e. g., 13 CFR

$$ 124.303-124.311, 124.403 (1994); 48 CFR subpt. 19.8 (1994),
one of which is automatic eligibility for subcontractor com-pensation provisions of the kind at issue in this case, 15

U. S. C. $ 637(d)(3)(C) (conferring presumptive eligibility onanyone "found to be disadvantaged . . . pursuant to section
8(a) of the Small Business Act"). To participate in the 8(a)program, a business must be "small," as defined in 13 CFR

$ 124.102 (1994); and it must be 51% owned by individuals
who qualify as "socially and economically disadvantaged,"

$ 124.103. The SBA presumes that black, Hispanic, Asian
Pacific, Subcontinent Asian, and Native Americans, as well
as "members of other groups designated from time to time
by SBA," are "socially disadvantaged," $ 124.105(b)(1). It
also allows any individual not a member of a listed group to
prove social disadvantage "on the basis of clear and convincing evidence," as described in $ 124.105(c). Social disadvantage is not enough to establish eligibility, however; SBA
also requires each 8(a) program participant to prove "economic disadvantage" according to the criteria set forth in

$ 124.106(a).

The other SBA program relevant to this case is the "8(d)
subcontracting program," which unlike the 8(a) program is
limited to eligibility for subcontracting provisions like the
one at issue here. In determining eligibility, the SBA presumes social disadvantage based on membership in certain
minority groups, just as in the 8(a) program, and again appears to require an individualized, although "less restrictive," showing of economic disadvantage, $ 124.106(b). A
different set of regulations, however, says that members of
minority groups wishing to participate in the 8(d) subcontracting program are entitled to a race-based presumption
of social and economic disadvantage. 48 CFR $$ 19.001,

Opinion of the Court
19.703(a)(2) (1994). We are left with some uncertainty asto whether participation in the 8(d) subcontracting program

requires an individualized showing of economic disadvan-tage. In any event, in both the 8(a) and the 8(d) programs,
the presumptions of disadvantage are rebuttable if a third
party comes forward with evidence suggesting that the par-ticipant is not, in fact, either economically or socially disadvantaged. 13 CFR $$ 124.111(c)-(d), 124.601-124.609 (1994).The contract giving rise to the dispute in this case came
about as a result of the Surface Transportation and UniformRelocation Assistance Act of 1987, Pub. L. 100-17, 101 Stat.
132 (STURAA), a DOT appropriations measure. Section
106(c)(1) of STURAA provides that "not less than 10 percent" of the appropriated funds "shall be expended with
small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and
economically disadvantaged individuals." 101 Stat. 145.
STURAA adopts the Small Business Act's definition of "socially and economically disadvantaged individual," including
the applicable race-based presumptions, and adds that
"women shall be presumed to be socially and economically
disadvantaged individuals for purposes of this subsection."

$ 106(c)(2)(B), 101 Stat. 146. STURAA also requires the
Secretary of Transportation to establish "minimum uniform
criteria for State governments to use in certifying whether
a concern qualifies for purposes of this subsection."

$ 106(c)(4), 101 Stat. 146. The Secretary has done so in 49
CFR pt. 23, subpt. D (1994). Those regulations say that the
certifying authority should presume both social and economic disadvantage (i. e., eligibility to participate) if the applicant belongs to certain racial groups, or is a woman. 49
CFR $ 23.62 (1994); 49 CFR pt. 23, subpt. D, App. C (1994).
As with the SBA programs, third parties may come forward
with evidence in an effort to rebut the presumption of disadvantage for a particular business. 49 CFR $ 23.69 (1994).

The operative clause in the contract in this case reads as
follows:

Opinion of the Court
under the DOT regulations--would meet that requirement.The record does not reveal how Gonzales obtained its certification as a small disadvantaged business.After losing the guardrail subcontract to Gonzales, Adarand filed suit against various federal officials in the UnitedStates District Court for the District of Colorado, claiming
that the race-based presumptions involved in the use of sub-contracting compensation clauses violate Adarand's right to
equal protection. The District Court granted the Govern-ment's motion for summary judgment.

Adarand Construc-tors, Inc. v. Skinner, 790 F. Supp. 240 (1992). The Court of

Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed. 16 F. 3d 1537 (1994).It understood our decision in

Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448U. S. 448 (1980), to have adopted "a lenient standard, resembling intermediate scrutiny, in assessing" the constitutional-ity of federal race-based action. 16 F. 3d, at 1544. Applying that "lenient standard," as further developed in MetroBroadcasting, Inc. v. FCC, 497 U. S. 547 (1990), the Court of
Appeals upheld the use of subcontractor compensationclauses. 16 F. 3d, at 1547. We granted certiorari. 512
U. S. 1288 (1994). II

Adarand, in addition to its general prayer for "such otherand further relief as to the Court seems just and equitable,"
specifically seeks declaratory and injunctive relief againstany

future use of subcontractor compensation clauses. App.22-23 (complaint). Before reaching the merits of Adarand's

challenge, we must consider whether Adarand has standingto seek forward-looking relief. Adarand's allegation that it
has lost a contract in the past because of a subcontractorcompensation clause of course entitles it to seek damages for
the loss of that contract (we express no view, however, as towhether sovereign immunity would bar such relief on these
facts). But as we explained in Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461U. S. 95 (1983), the fact of past injury, "while presumably
affording [the plaintiff] standing to claim damages . . . , does

211Cite as: 515 U. S. 200 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
nothing to establish a real and immediate threat that hewould again" suffer similar injury in the future.

Id., at 105.
If Adarand is to maintain its claim for forward-lookingrelief, our cases require it to allege that the use of subcontractor compensation clauses in the future constitutes "an
invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concreteand particularized, and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical." Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504U. S. 555, 560 (1992) (footnote, citations, and internal quotation marks omitted). Adarand's claim that the Govern-ment's use of subcontractor compensation clauses denies it
equal protection of the laws of course alleges an invasion of
a legally protected interest, and it does so in a manner that
is "particularized" as to Adarand. We note that, contrary to
respondents' suggestion, see Brief for Respondents 29-30,
Adarand need not demonstrate that it has been, or will be,
the low bidder on a Government contract. The injury in
cases of this kind is that a "discriminatory classification prevent[s] the plaintiff from competing on an equal footing."
Northeastern Fla. Chapter, Associated Gen. Contractors of
America v. Jacksonville, 508 U. S. 656, 667 (1993). The aggrieved party "need not allege that he would have obtained
the benefit but for the barrier in order to establish standing."
Id., at 666.

It is less clear, however, that the future use of subcontractor compensation clauses will cause Adarand "imminent" injury. We said in Lujan that "[a]lthough `imminence' is concededly a somewhat elastic concept, it cannot be stretched
beyond its purpose, which is to ensure that the alleged injury
is not too speculative for Article III purposes--that the injury is `certainly impending.' " Lujan, supra, at 565, n. 2.
We therefore must ask whether Adarand has made an adequate showing that sometime in the relatively near future it
will bid on another Government contract that offers financial
incentives to a prime contractor for hiring disadvantaged
subcontractors.

212 ADARAND CONSTRUCTORS, INC. v. PENA

Opinion of the Court
We conclude that Adarand has satisfied this requirement.Adarand's general manager said in a deposition that his company bids on every guardrail project in Colorado. SeeReply Brief for Petitioner 5-A. According to documents
produced in discovery, the CFLHD let 14 prime contracts inColorado that included guardrail work between 1983 and
1990. Plaintiff 's Motion for Summary Judgment in No. 90-C-1413, Exh. I, Attachment A (D. Colo.). Two of those contracts do not present the kind of injury Adarand alleges here.In one, the prime contractor did not subcontract out the
guardrail work; in another, the prime contractor was itself adisadvantaged business, and in such cases the contract generally does not include a subcontractor compensation clause.Ibid.; see also id., Supplemental Exhibits, Deposition of
Craig Actis 14 (testimony of CFLHD employee that 8(a) con-tracts do not include subcontractor compensation clauses).
Thus, statistics from the years 1983 through 1990 indicatethat the CFLHD lets on average 1

1/2 contracts per year that

could injure Adarand in the manner it alleges here. Noth-ing in the record suggests that the CFLHD has altered the

frequency with which it lets contracts that include guardrailwork. And the record indicates that Adarand often must
compete for contracts against companies certified as smalldisadvantaged businesses. See id., Exh. F, Attachments
1-3. Because the evidence in this case indicates that theCFLHD is likely to let contracts involving guardrail work
that contain a subcontractor compensation clause at leastonce per year in Colorado, that Adarand is very likely to bid
on each such contract, and that Adarand often must competefor such contracts against small disadvantaged businesses,
we are satisfied that Adarand has standing to bring thislawsuit.

Respondents urge that "[t]he Subcontracting Compensa-tion Clause program is . . . a program based on disadvantage,

not on race," and thus that it is subject only to "the most

Opinion of the Court
relaxed judicial scrutiny." Brief for Respondents 26. Tothe extent that the statutes and regulations involved in this

case are race neutral, we agree. Respondents concede, how-ever, that "the race-based rebuttable presumption used in
some certification determinations under the SubcontractingCompensation Clause" is subject to some heightened level of
scrutiny. Id., at 27. The parties disagree as to what thatlevel should be. (We note, incidentally, that this case concerns only classifications based explicitly on race, and pre-sents none of the additional difficulties posed by laws that,
although facially race neutral, result in racially dispropor-tionate impact and are motivated by a racially discriminatory
purpose. See generally Arlington Heights v. MetropolitanHousing Development Corp., 429 U. S. 252 (1977); Washington v. Davis, 426 U. S. 229 (1976).)Adarand's claim arises under the Fifth Amendment to the
Constitution, which provides that "No person shall . . . bedeprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of
law." Although this Court has always understood thatClause to provide some measure of protection against

arbi-trary treatment by the Federal Government, it is not as explicit a guarantee of equal treatment as the FourteenthAmendment, which provides that "No State shall . . . deny
to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection ofthe laws" (emphasis added). Our cases have accorded varying degrees of significance to the difference in the languageof those two Clauses. We think it necessary to revisit the
issue here. A

Through the 1940's, this Court had routinely taken theview in non-race-related cases that, "[u]nlike the Fourteenth
Amendment, the Fifth contains no equal protection clauseand it provides no guaranty against discriminatory legislation by Congress." Detroit Bank v. United States, 317 U. S.329, 337 (1943); see also,

e. g., Helvering v. Lerner StoresCorp., 314 U. S. 463, 468 (1941); LaBelle Iron Works v. United

214 ADARAND CONSTRUCTORS, INC. v. PENA

Opinion of the Court
States, 256 U. S. 377, 392 (1921) ("Reference is made to casesdecided under the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth

Amendment . . . ; but clearly they are not in point. TheFifth Amendment has no equal protection clause"). When
the Court first faced a Fifth Amendment equal protection
challenge to a federal racial classification, it adopted a similarapproach, with most unfortunate results. In

Hirabayashi v.
United States, 320 U. S. 81 (1943), the Court considered acurfew applicable only to persons of Japanese ancestry. The

Court observed--correctly--that "[d]istinctions between cit-izens solely because of their ancestry are by their very nature odious to a free people whose institutions are founded
upon the doctrine of equality," and that "racial discriminations are in most circumstances irrelevant and therefore prohibited." Id., at 100. But it also cited Detroit Bank for the
proposition that the Fifth Amendment "restrains only such
discriminatory legislation by Congress as amounts to a denial of due process," 320 U. S., at 100, and upheld the curfew
because "circumstances within the knowledge of those
charged with the responsibility for maintaining the national
defense afforded a rational basis for the decision which they
made." Id., at 102.

Eighteen months later, the Court again approved wartime
measures directed at persons of Japanese ancestry. Korematsu v. United States, 323 U. S. 214 (1944), concerned an
order that completely excluded such persons from particular
areas. The Court did not address the view, expressed in
cases like Hirabayashi and Detroit Bank, that the Federal
Government's obligation to provide equal protection differs
significantly from that of the States. Instead, it began by
noting that "all legal restrictions which curtail the civil
rights of a single racial group are immediately suspect . . .
[and] courts must subject them to the most rigid scrutiny."
323 U. S., at 216. That promising dictum might be read to
undermine the view that the Federal Government is under
a lesser obligation to avoid injurious racial classifications

215Cite as: 515 U. S. 200 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
than are the States. Cf. id., at 234-235 (Murphy, J., dissenting) ("[T]he order deprives all those within its scope of the
equal protection of the laws as guaranteed by the Fifth
Amendment"). But in spite of the "most rigid scrutiny"
standard it had just set forth, the Court then inexplicably
relied on "the principles we announced in the Hirabayashi
case," id., at 217, to conclude that, although "exclusion from
the area in which one's home is located is a far greater deprivation than constant confinement to the home from 8 p. m.
to 6 a. m.," id., at 218, the racially discriminatory order was
nonetheless within the Federal Government's power.*

In Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U. S. 497 (1954), the Court for
the first time explicitly questioned the existence of any difference between the obligations of the Federal Government
and the States to avoid racial classifications. Bolling did
note that "[t]he `equal protection of the laws' is a more explicit safeguard of prohibited unfairness than `due process of
law,' " id., at 499. But Bolling then concluded that, "[i]n
view of [the] decision that the Constitution prohibits the
states from maintaining racially segregated public schools, it
would be unthinkable that the same Constitution would impose a lesser duty on the Federal Government." Id., at 500.

Bolling's facts concerned school desegregation, but its reasoning was not so limited. The Court's observations that
"[d]istinctions between citizens solely because of their ancestry are by their very nature odious," Hirabayashi, supra,
at 100, and that "all legal restrictions which curtail the
civil rights of a single racial group are immediately suspect,"

*Justices Roberts, Murphy, and Jackson filed vigorous dissents; Justice
Murphy argued that the challenged order "falls into the ugly abyss of
racism." Korematsu, 323 U. S., at 233. Congress has recently agreed
with the dissenters' position, and has attempted to make amends. See
Pub. L. 100-383, $ 2(a), 102 Stat. 903 ("The Congress recognizes that . . .
a grave injustice was done to both citizens and permanent resident aliens
of Japanese ancestry by the evacuation, relocation, and internment of civilians during World War II").

216 ADARAND CONSTRUCTORS, INC. v. PENA

Opinion of the Court
Korematsu, supra, at 216, carry no less force in the context
of federal action than in the context of action by the States--
indeed, they first appeared in cases concerning action by the
Federal Government. Bolling relied on those observations,
347 U. S., at 499, n. 3, and reiterated " `that the Constitution
of the United States, in its present form, forbids, so far as
civil and political rights are concerned, discrimination by the
General Government, or by the States, against any citizen
because of his race,' " id., at 499 (quoting Gibson v. Mississippi, 162 U. S. 565, 591 (1896)) (emphasis added). The
Court's application of that general principle to the case before it, and the resulting imposition on the Federal Government of an obligation equivalent to that of the States, followed as a matter of course.

Later cases in contexts other than school desegregation
did not distinguish between the duties of the States and the
Federal Government to avoid racial classifications. Consider, for example, the following passage from McLaughlin
v. Florida, 379 U. S. 184, a 1964 case that struck down a
race-based state law:

"[W]e deal here with a classification based upon the race
of the participants, which must be viewed in light of the
historical fact that the central purpose of the Fourteenth
Amendment was to eliminate racial discrimination emanating from official sources in the States. This strong
policy renders racial classifications `constitutionally suspect,' Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U. S. 497, 499; and subject
to the `most rigid scrutiny,' Korematsu v. United States,

323 U. S. 214, 216; and `in most circumstances irrelevant'
to any constitutionally acceptable legislative purpose,
Hirabayashi v. United States, 320 U. S. 81, 100." Id.,
at 191-192.

McLaughlin's reliance on cases involving federal action for
the standards applicable to a case involving state legislation

217Cite as: 515 U. S. 200 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
suggests that the Court understood the standards for federaland state racial classifications to be the same.

Cases decided after McLaughlin continued to treat theequal protection obligations imposed by the Fifth and the
Fourteenth Amendments as indistinguishable; one commentator observed that "[i]n case after case, fifth amendmentequal protection problems are discussed on the assumption

that fourteenth amendment precedents are controlling."Karst, The Fifth Amendment's Guarantee of Equal Protection, 55 N. C. L. Rev. 541, 554 (1977). Loving v. Virginia,388 U. S. 1 (1967), which struck down a race-based state law,
cited Korematsu for the proposition that "the Equal Protection Clause demands that racial classifications . . . be subjected to the `most rigid scrutiny.' " 388 U. S., at 11. The
various opinions in Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U. S. 677
(1973), which concerned sex discrimination by the Federal
Government, took their equal protection standard of review
from Reed v. Reed, 404 U. S. 71 (1971), a case that invalidated
sex discrimination by a State, without mentioning any possibility of a difference between the standards applicable to
state and federal action. Frontiero, 411 U. S., at 682-684
(plurality opinion of Brennan, J.); id., at 691 (Stewart, J., concurring in judgment); id., at 692 (Powell, J., concurring in
judgment). Thus, in 1975, the Court stated explicitly that
"[t]his Court's approach to Fifth Amendment equal protection claims has always been precisely the same as to
equal protection claims under the Fourteenth Amendment."
Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U. S. 636, 638, n. 2; see also
Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 93 (1976) ("Equal protection
analysis in the Fifth Amendment area is the same as that
under the Fourteenth Amendment"); United States v. Paradise, 480 U. S. 149, 166, n. 16 (1987) (plurality opinion of
Brennan, J.) ("[T]he reach of the equal protection guarantee
of the Fifth Amendment is coextensive with that of the Fourteenth"). We do not understand a few contrary suggestions
appearing in cases in which we found special deference to

Opinion of the Court
the political branches of the Federal Government to be appropriate, e. g., Hampton v. Mow Sun Wong, 426 U. S. 88,
100, 101-102, n. 21 (1976) (federal power over immigration),
to detract from this general rule.

B
Most of the cases discussed above involved classifications
burdening groups that have suffered discrimination in our
society. In 1978, the Court confronted the question whether
race-based governmental action designed to benefit such
groups should also be subject to "the most rigid scrutiny."
Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U. S. 265, involved
an equal protection challenge to a state-run medical school's
practice of reserving a number of spaces in its entering class
for minority students. The petitioners argued that "strict
scrutiny" should apply only to "classifications that disadvantage `discrete and insular minorities.' " Id., at 287-288
(opinion of Powell, J.) (citing United States v. Carolene Products Co., 304 U. S. 144, 152, n. 4 (1938)). Bakke did not
produce an opinion for the Court, but Justice Powell's opinion announcing the Court's judgment rejected the argument.
In a passage joined by Justice White, Justice Powell wrote
that "[t]he guarantee of equal protection cannot mean one
thing when applied to one individual and something else
when applied to a person of another color." 438 U. S., at
289-290. He concluded that "[r]acial and ethnic distinctions
of any sort are inherently suspect and thus call for the most
exacting judicial examination." Id., at 291. On the other
hand, four Justices in Bakke would have applied a less stringent standard of review to racial classifications "designed to
further remedial purposes," see id., at 359 (Brennan, White,
Marshall, and Blackmun, JJ., concurring in judgment in part
and dissenting in part). And four Justices thought the case
should be decided on statutory grounds. Id., at 411-412, 421
(Stevens, J., joined by Burger, C. J., and Stewart and Rehn515us1$70j 08-25-98 19:19:32 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
quist, JJ., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting inpart).

Two years after Bakke, the Court faced another challengeto remedial race-based action, this time involving action
undertaken by the Federal Government. In Fullilove v.
Klutznick, 448 U. S. 448 (1980), the Court upheld Congress'inclusion of a 10% set-aside for minority-owned businesses

in the Public Works Employment Act of 1977. As in Bakke,there was no opinion for the Court. Chief Justice Burger,
in an opinion joined by Justices White and Powell, observedthat "[a]ny preference based on racial or ethnic criteria must
necessarily receive a most searching examination to make
sure that it does not conflict with constitutional guarantees."
448 U. S., at 491. That opinion, however, "d[id] not adopt,
either expressly or implicitly, the formulas of analysis articulated in such cases as [Bakke]." Id., at 492. It employed
instead a two-part test which asked, first, "whether the objectives of th[e] legislation are within the power of Congress," and second, "whether the limited use of racial and
ethnic criteria, in the context presented, is a constitutionally
permissible means for achieving the congressional objectives." Id., at 473. It then upheld the program under that
test, adding at the end of the opinion that the program also
"would survive judicial review under either `test' articulated
in the several Bakke opinions." Id., at 492. Justice Powell
wrote separately to express his view that the plurality opinion had essentially applied "strict scrutiny" as described in
his Bakke opinion--i. e., it had determined that the set-aside
was "a necessary means of advancing a compelling governmental interest"--and had done so correctly. 448 U. S., at
496 (concurring opinion). Justice Stewart ( joined by thenJustice Rehnquist) dissented, arguing that the Constitution required the Federal Government to meet the same
strict standard as the States when enacting racial classifications, id., at 523, and n. 1, and that the program before the
Court failed that standard. Justice Stevens also dis515us1$70j 08-25-98 19:19:32 PAGES OPINPGT
220 ADARAND CONSTRUCTORS, INC. v. PENA

Opinion of the Court
sented, arguing that "[r]acial classifications are simply toopernicious to permit any but the most exact connection between justification and classification," id., at 537, and thatthe program before the Court could not be characterized "as
a `narrowly tailored' remedial measure." Id., at 541. Justice Marshall ( joined by Justices Brennan and Blackmun)concurred in the judgment, reiterating the view of four Justices in Bakke that any race-based governmental action de-signed to "remed[y] the present effects of past racial discrimination" should be upheld if it was "substantially related" tothe achievement of an "important governmental objective"--
i. e., such action should be subjected only to what we now
call "intermediate scrutiny." 448 U. S., at 518-519.

In Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Ed., 476 U. S. 267 (1986), the
Court considered a Fourteenth Amendment challenge to another form of remedial racial classification. The issue in
Wygant was whether a school board could adopt race-based
preferences in determining which teachers to lay off. Justice Powell's plurality opinion observed that "the level of
scrutiny does not change merely because the challenged classification operates against a group that historically has not
been subject to governmental discrimination," id., at 273,
and stated the two-part inquiry as "whether the layoff provision is supported by a compelling state purpose and whether
the means chosen to accomplish that purpose are narrowly
tailored." Id., at 274. In other words, "racial classifications
of any sort must be subjected to `strict scrutiny.' " Id., at
285 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). The plurality then concluded that the school board's
interest in "providing minority role models for its minority
students, as an attempt to alleviate the effects of societal
discrimination," id., at 274, was not a compelling interest
that could justify the use of a racial classification. It added
that "[s]ocietal discrimination, without more, is too amorphous a basis for imposing a racially classified remedy," id.,
at 276, and insisted instead that "a public employer . . . must

Opinion of the Court
ensure that, before it embarks on an affirmative-action pro-gram, it has convincing evidence that remedial action is warranted. That is, it must have sufficient evidence to justifythe conclusion that there has been prior discrimination,"

id.,
at 277. Justice White concurred only in the judgment, although he agreed that the school board's asserted interestscould not, "singly or together, justify this racially discriminatory layoff policy." Id., at 295. Four Justices dissented,three of whom again argued for intermediate scrutiny of remedial race-based government action. Id., at 301-302 (Mar-shall, J., joined by Brennan and Blackmun, JJ., dissenting).

The Court's failure to produce a majority opinion in Bakke,
Fullilove, and Wygant left unresolved the proper analysis
for remedial race-based governmental action. See United
States v. Paradise, 480 U. S., at 166 (plurality opinion of
Brennan, J.) ("[A]lthough this Court has consistently held
that some elevated level of scrutiny is required when a racial
or ethnic distinction is made for remedial purposes, it has
yet to reach consensus on the appropriate constitutional
analysis"); Sheet Metal Workers v. EEOC, 478 U. S. 421,
480 (1986) (plurality opinion of Brennan, J.). Lower courts
found this lack of guidance unsettling. See, e. g., Kromnick
v. School Dist. of Philadelphia, 739 F. 2d 894, 901 (CA3 1984)
("The absence of an Opinion of the Court in either Bakke or
Fullilove and the concomitant failure of the Court to articulate an analytic framework supporting the judgments makes
the position of the lower federal courts considering the constitutionality of affirmative action programs somewhat vulnerable"), cert. denied, 469 U. S. 1107 (1985); Williams v.
New Orleans, 729 F. 2d 1554, 1567 (CA5 1984) (en banc) (Higginbotham, J., concurring specially); South Florida Chapter
of Associated General Contractors of America, Inc. v. Metropolitan Dade County, Fla., 723 F. 2d 846, 851 (CA11), cert.
denied, 469 U. S. 871 (1984).

The Court resolved the issue, at least in part, in 1989. Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469 (1989), concerned a

222 ADARAND CONSTRUCTORS, INC. v. PENA

Opinion of the Court
city's determination that 30% of its contracting work shouldgo to minority-owned businesses. A majority of the Court

in Croson held that "the standard of review under the EqualProtection Clause is not dependent on the race of those burdened or benefited by a particular classification," and that
the single standard of review for racial classifications shouldbe "strict scrutiny."

Id., at 493-494 (opinion of O'Connor,
J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and White and Kennedy, JJ.);
id., at 520 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) ("I agree . . .
with Justice O'Connor's conclusion that strict scrutinymust be applied to all governmental classification by race").

As to the classification before the Court, the plurality agreed
that "a state or local subdivision . . . has the authority to
eradicate the effects of private discrimination within its own
legislative jurisdiction," id., at 491-492, but the Court
thought that the city had not acted with "a `strong basis in
evidence for its conclusion that remedial action was necessary,' " id., at 500 (majority opinion) (quoting Wygant, supra,
at 277 (plurality opinion)). The Court also thought it "obvious that [the] program is not narrowly tailored to remedy
the effects of prior discrimination." 488 U. S., at 508.

With Croson, the Court finally agreed that the Fourteenth
Amendment requires strict scrutiny of all race-based action
by state and local governments. But Croson of course had
no occasion to declare what standard of review the Fifth
Amendment requires for such action taken by the Federal
Government. Croson observed simply that the Court's
"treatment of an exercise of congressional power in Fullilove cannot be dispositive here," because Croson's facts did
not implicate Congress' broad power under $ 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. Id., at 491 (plurality opinion); see also
id., at 522 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) ("[W]ithout
revisiting what we held in Fullilove . . . , I do not believe
our decision in that case controls the one before us here").
On the other hand, the Court subsequently indicated that
Croson had at least some bearing on federal race-based ac515US1 Unit: $U70 [05-24-00 19:58:21] PAGES PGT: OPIN

it impossible to reach a firm opinion as to the evidence of
discrimination needed to sustain a congressional mandate
of racial preferences"), aff 'd sub nom. Metro Broadcasting,
supra.

Despite lingering uncertainty in the details, however, the
Court's cases through Croson had established three general
propositions with respect to governmental racial classifications. First, skepticism: " `Any preference based on racial
or ethnic criteria must necessarily receive a most searching
examination,' " Wygant, 476 U. S., at 273 (plurality opinion of
Powell, J.); Fullilove, 448 U. S., at 491 (opinion of Burger,
C. J.); see also id., at 523 (Stewart, J., dissenting) ("[A]ny
official action that treats a person differently on account of
his race or ethnic origin is inherently suspect"); McLaughlin,
379 U. S., at 192 ("[R]acial classifications [are] `constitutionally suspect' "); Hirabayashi, 320 U. S., at 100 ("Distinctions

Opinion of the Court
between citizens solely because of their ancestry are by theirvery nature odious to a free people"). Second, consistency:

"[T]he standard of review under the Equal Protection Clauseis not dependent on the race of those burdened or benefited
by a particular classification," Croson, 488 U. S., at 494 (plu-rality opinion);

id., at 520 (Scalia, J., concurring in judg-ment); see also Bakke, 438 U. S., at 289-290 (opinion of Powell, J.), i. e., all racial classifications reviewable under theEqual Protection Clause must be strictly scrutinized. And
third, congruence: "Equal protection analysis in the FifthAmendment area is the same as that under the Fourteenth
Amendment," Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S., at 93; see also
Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U. S., at 638, n. 2; Bolling v.Sharpe, 347 U. S., at 500. Taken together, these three propositions lead to the conclusion that any person, of whateverrace, has the right to demand that any governmental actor
subject to the Constitution justify any racial classificationsubjecting that person to unequal treatment under the strictest judicial scrutiny. Justice Powell's defense of this conclu-sion bears repeating here:

"If it is the individual who is entitled to judicial pro-tection against classifications based upon his racial or
ethnic background because such distinctions impingeupon personal rights, rather than the individual only because of his membership in a particular group, thenconstitutional standards may be applied consistently.
Political judgments regarding the necessity for the par-ticular classification may be weighed in the constitutional balance, [Korematsu], but the standard of justifi-cation will remain constant. This is as it should be,
since those political judgments are the product of roughcompromise struck by contending groups within the
democratic process. When they touch upon an individ-ual's race or ethnic background, he is entitled to a judicial determination that the burden he is asked to bearon that basis is precisely tailored to serve a compelling

governmental interest. The Constitution guarantees
that right to every person regardless of his background.
Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U. S. [1, 22 (1948)]." Bakke,
supra, at 299 (opinion of Powell, J.) (footnote omitted).

A year later, however, the Court took a surprising turn.
Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC, supra, involved a Fifth
Amendment challenge to two race-based policies of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). In Metro Broadcasting, the Court repudiated the long-held notion that "it
would be unthinkable that the same Constitution would impose a lesser duty on the Federal Government" than it does
on a State to afford equal protection of the laws, Bolling,
supra, at 500. It did so by holding that "benign" federal
racial classifications need only satisfy intermediate scrutiny,
even though Croson had recently concluded that such classifications enacted by a State must satisfy strict scrutiny.
"[B]enign" federal racial classifications, the Court said,
"--even if those measures are not `remedial' in the sense of
being designed to compensate victims of past governmental
or societal discrimination--are constitutionally permissible
to the extent that they serve important governmental objectives within the power of Congress and are substantially
related to achievement of those objectives." Metro Broadcasting, 497 U. S., at 564-565 (emphasis added). The Court
did not explain how to tell whether a racial classification
should be deemed "benign," other than to express "confiden[ce] that an `examination of the legislative scheme and its
history' will separate benign measures from other types of
racial classifications." Id., at 564, n. 12 (citation omitted).

Applying this test, the Court first noted that the FCC policies at issue did not serve as a remedy for past discrimination. Id., at 566. Proceeding on the assumption that the
policies were nonetheless "benign," it concluded that they
served the "important governmental objective" of "enhancing broadcast diversity," id., at 566-567, and that they were

226 ADARAND CONSTRUCTORS, INC. v. PENA

Opinion of the Court
"substantially related" to that objective, id., at 569. Ittherefore upheld the policies.

By adopting intermediate scrutiny as the standard ofreview for congressionally mandated "benign" racial classifications, Metro Broadcasting departed from prior cases in
two significant respects. First, it turned its back on Croson's explanation of why strict scrutiny of all governmental
racial classifications is essential:

"Absent searching judicial inquiry into the justifica-tion for such race-based measures, there is simply no

way of determining what classifications are `benign' or
`remedial' and what classifications are in fact motivatedby illegitimate notions of racial inferiority or simple racial politics. Indeed, the purpose of strict scrutiny is to`smoke out' illegitimate uses of race by assuring that the
legislative body is pursuing a goal important enough towarrant use of a highly suspect tool. The test also ensures that the means chosen `fit' this compelling goal so
closely that there is little or no possibility that the mo-tive for the classification was illegitimate racial prejudice or stereotype." Croson, supra, at 493 (pluralityopinion of

O'Connor, J.).

We adhere to that view today, despite the surface appeal of
holding "benign" racial classifications to a lower standard,
because "it may not always be clear that a so-called prefer-ence is in fact benign,"

Bakke, supra, at 298 (opinion of Powell, J.). "[M]ore than good motives should be required whengovernment seeks to allocate its resources by way of an explicit racial classification system." Days, Fullilove, 96 Yale
L. J. 453, 485 (1987).

Second, Metro Broadcasting squarely rejected one of the
three propositions established by the Court's earlier equal
protection cases, namely, congruence between the standards
applicable to federal and state racial classifications, and in so
doing also undermined the other two--skepticism of all racial

Opinion of the Court
classifications and consistency of treatment irrespective ofthe race of the burdened or benefited group. See

supra, at
223-224. Under Metro Broadcasting, certain racial classi-fications ("benign" ones enacted by the Federal Government)

should be treated less skeptically than others; and the race of
the benefited group is critical to the determination of whichstandard of review to apply.

Metro Broadcasting was thus a
significant departure from much of what had come before it.The three propositions undermined by

Metro Broadcasting all derive from the basic principle that the Fifth andFourteenth Amendments to the Constitution protect

persons, not groups. It follows from that principle that all governmental action based on race--a group classification long
recognized as "in most circumstances irrelevant and therefore prohibited," Hirabayashi, 320 U. S., at 100--should be
subjected to detailed judicial inquiry to ensure that the personal right to equal protection of the laws has not been infringed. These ideas have long been central to this Court's
understanding of equal protection, and holding "benign"
state and federal racial classifications to different standards
does not square with them. "[A] free people whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality," ibid., should
tolerate no retreat from the principle that government may
treat people differently because of their race only for the
most compelling reasons. Accordingly, we hold today that
all racial classifications, imposed by whatever federal, state,
or local governmental actor, must be analyzed by a reviewing court under strict scrutiny. In other words, such classifications are constitutional only if they are narrowly tailored
measures that further compelling governmental interests.
To the extent that Metro Broadcasting is inconsistent with
that holding, it is overruled.

In dissent, Justice Stevens criticizes us for "deliver[ing]
a disconcerting lecture about the evils of governmental racial
classifications," post, at 242. With respect, we believe his
criticisms reflect a serious misunderstanding of our opinion.

515us1$70j 08-25-98 19:19:32 PAGES OPINPGT
228 ADARAND CONSTRUCTORS, INC. v. PENA

Opinion of the Court
Justice Stevens concurs in our view that courts shouldtake a skeptical view of all governmental racial classifications. Ibid. He also allows that "[n]othing is inherentlywrong with applying a single standard to fundamentally different situations, as long as that standard takes relevant differences into account." Post, at 246. What he fails to rec-ognize is that strict scrutiny

does take "relevant differences"
into account--indeed, that is its fundamental purpose. Thepoint of carefully examining the interest asserted by the government in support of a racial classification, and the evidenceoffered to show that the classification is needed, is precisely
to distinguish legitimate from illegitimate uses of race in
governmental decisionmaking. See supra, at 226. And
Justice Stevens concedes that "some cases may be difficult
to classify," post, at 245, and n. 4; all the more reason, in our
view, to examine all racial classifications carefully. Strict
scrutiny does not "trea[t] dissimilar race-based decisions as
though they were equally objectionable," post, at 245; to the
contrary, it evaluates carefully all governmental race-based
decisions in order to decide which are constitutionally objectionable and which are not. By requiring strict scrutiny of
racial classifications, we require courts to make sure that a
governmental classification based on race, which "so seldom
provide[s] a relevant basis for disparate treatment," Fullilove, 448 U. S., at 534 (Stevens, J., dissenting), is legitimate,
before permitting unequal treatment based on race to
proceed.

Justice Stevens chides us for our "supposed inability to
differentiate between `invidious' and `benign' discrimination," because it is in his view sufficient that "people understand the difference between good intentions and bad."
Post, at 245. But, as we have just explained, the point of
strict scrutiny is to "differentiate between" permissible and
impermissible governmental use of race. And Justice
Stevens himself has already explained in his dissent in Fullilove why "good intentions" alone are not enough to sustain

Opinion of the Court
a supposedly "benign" racial classification: "[E]ven though itis not the actual predicate for this legislation, a statute of

this kind inevitably is perceived by many as resting on anassumption that those who are granted this special preference are less qualified in some respect that is identified
purely by their race. Because that perception--especially
when fostered by the Congress of the United States--can only
exacerbate rather than reduce racial prejudice, it will delaythe time when race will become a truly irrelevant, or at least

insignificant, factor. Unless Congress clearly articulates
the need and basis for a racial classification, and also tailors
the classification to its justification, the Court should not
uphold this kind of statute." Fullilove, 448 U. S., at 545
(dissenting opinion) (emphasis added; footnote omitted); see
also id., at 537 ("Racial classifications are simply too pernicious to permit any but the most exact connection between
justification and classification"); Croson, 488 U. S., at 516-517
(Stevens, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) ("Although [the legislation at issue] stigmatizes the
disadvantaged class with the unproven charge of past racial
discrimination, it actually imposes a greater stigma on its
supposed beneficiaries"); supra, at 226; but cf. post, at 245-
246 (Stevens, J., dissenting). These passages make a persuasive case for requiring strict scrutiny of congressional
racial classifications.

Perhaps it is not the standard of strict scrutiny itself, but
our use of the concepts of "consistency" and "congruence" in
conjunction with it, that leads Justice Stevens to dissent.
According to Justice Stevens, our view of consistency
"equate[s] remedial preferences with invidious discrimination," post, at 246, and ignores the difference between "an
engine of oppression" and an effort "to foster equality in
society," or, more colorfully, "between a `No Trespassing'
sign and a welcome mat," post, at 243, 245. It does nothing
of the kind. The principle of consistency simply means that
whenever the government treats any person unequally be515us1$70j 08-25-98 19:19:32 PAGES OPINPGT
230 ADARAND CONSTRUCTORS, INC. v. PENA

Opinion of the Court
cause of his or her race, that person has suffered an injurythat falls squarely within the language and spirit of the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection. It says nothingabout the ultimate validity of any particular law; that determination is the job of the court applying strict scrutiny. The
principle of consistency explains the circumstances in whichthe injury requiring strict scrutiny occurs. The application

of strict scrutiny, in turn, determines whether a compellinggovernmental interest justifies the infliction of that injury.

Consistency does recognize that any individual suffers aninjury when he or she is disadvantaged by the government
because of his or her race, whatever that race may be. This
Court clearly stated that principle in Croson, see 488 U. S.,
at 493-494 (plurality opinion); id., at 520-521 (Scalia, J.,
concurring in judgment); see also Shaw v. Reno, 509 U. S.
630, 643 (1993); Powers v. Ohio, 499 U. S. 400, 410 (1991).
Justice Stevens does not explain how his views square
with Croson, or with the long line of cases understanding
equal protection as a personal right.

Justice Stevens also claims that we have ignored any
difference between federal and state legislatures. But requiring that Congress, like the States, enact racial classifications only when doing so is necessary to further a "compelling interest" does not contravene any principle of
appropriate respect for a coequal branch of the Government.
It is true that various Members of this Court have taken
different views of the authority $ 5 of the Fourteenth
Amendment confers upon Congress to deal with the problem
of racial discrimination, and the extent to which courts
should defer to Congress' exercise of that authority. See,
e. g., Metro Broadcasting, 497 U. S., at 605-606 (O'Connor,
J., dissenting); Croson, 488 U. S., at 486-493 (opinion of
O'Connor, J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and White, J.); id.,
at 518-519 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring
in judgment); id., at 521-524 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment); Fullilove, 448 U. S., at 472-473 (opinion of Burger,

C. J.); id., at 500-502, and nn. 2-3, 515, and n. 14 (Powell, J.,concurring); id., at 526-527 (Stewart, J., dissenting). We

need not, and do not, address these differences today. Fornow, it is enough to observe that

Justice Stevens' sugges-tion that any Member of this Court has repudiated in this

case his or her previously expressed views on the subject,post, at 249-253, 256-257, is incorrect.

C
"Although adherence to precedent is not rigidly requiredin constitutional cases, any departure from the doctrine of

stare decisis demands special justification." Arizona v.Rumsey, 467 U. S. 203, 212 (1984). In deciding whether this
case presents such justification, we recall Justice Frankfurt-er's admonition that "stare decisis is a principle of policy and
not a mechanical formula of adherence to the latest decision,however recent and questionable, when such adherence involves collision with a prior doctrine more embracing in itsscope, intrinsically sounder, and verified by experience."
Helvering v. Hallock, 309 U. S. 106, 119 (1940). Remainingtrue to an "intrinsically sounder" doctrine established in
prior cases better serves the values of stare decisis thanwould following a more recently decided case inconsistent
with the decisions that came before it; the latter coursewould simply compound the recent error and would likely
make the unjustified break from previously established doc-trine complete. In such a situation, "special justification"
exists to depart from the recently decided case.As we have explained, Metro Broadcasting undermined
important principles of this Court's equal protection juris-prudence, established in a line of cases stretching back over
50 years, see supra, at 213-225. Those principles togetherstood for an "embracing" and "intrinsically soun[d]" understanding of equal protection "verified by experience,"namely, that the Constitution imposes upon federal, state,
and local governmental actors the same obligation to respect

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
the personal right to equal protection of the laws. This casetherefore presents precisely the situation described by Justice Frankfurter in Helvering: We cannot adhere to our mostrecent decision without colliding with an accepted and established doctrine. We also note that Metro Broadcasting's application of different standards of review to federal and stateracial classifications has been consistently criticized by commentators. See, e. g., Fried, Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v.
FCC: Two Concepts of Equality, 104 Harv. L. Rev. 107, 113-
117 (1990) (arguing that Metro Broadcasting's adoption ofdifferent standards of review for federal and state racial classifications placed the law in an "unstable condition," and advocating strict scrutiny across the board); Comment, Metro
Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC: Requiem for a Heavyweight, 69
Texas L. Rev. 125, 145-146 (1990) (same); Linder, Review of
Affirmative Action After Metro Broadcasting v. FCC: The
Solution Almost Nobody Wanted, 59 UMKC L. Rev. 293, 297,
316-317 (1991) (criticizing "anomalous results as exemplified
by the two different standards of review"); Katz, Public Affirmative Action and the Fourteenth Amendment: The Fragmentation of Theory After Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co.
and Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. Federal Communications
Commission, 17 T. Marshall L. Rev. 317, 319, 354-355, 357
(1992) (arguing that "the current fragmentation of doctrine
must be seen as a dangerous and seriously flawed approach
to constitutional interpretation," and advocating intermediate scrutiny across the board).

Our past practice in similar situations supports our action
today. In United States v. Dixon, 509 U. S. 688 (1993), we
overruled the recent case of Grady v. Corbin, 495 U. S. 508
(1990), because Grady "lack[ed] constitutional roots" and was
"wholly inconsistent with earlier Supreme Court precedent."
Dixon, supra, at 704, 712. In Solorio v. United States, 483
U. S. 435 (1987), we overruled O'Callahan v. Parker, 395

lorio, supra, at 439-441, 450-451. And in Continental T. V.,
Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., 433 U. S. 36 (1977), we overruled
United States v. Arnold, Schwinn & Co., 388 U. S. 365 (1967),which was "an abrupt and largely unexplained departure"

from precedent, and of which "[t]he great weight of scholarly
opinion ha[d] been critical." Continental T. V., supra, at 47-48, 58. See also,

e. g., Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 830
(1991) (overruling Booth v. Maryland, 482 U. S. 496 (1987),and

South Carolina v. Gathers, 490 U. S. 805 (1989)); Monell
v. New York City Dept. of Social Servs., 436 U. S. 658, 695-701 (1978) (partially overruling

Monroe v. Pape, 365 U. S.
167 (1961), because Monroe was a "departure from prior
practice" that had not engendered substantial reliance);
Swift & Co. v. Wickham, 382 U. S. 111, 128-129 (1965) (overruling Kesler v. Department of Public Safety of Utah, 369
U. S. 153 (1962), to reaffirm "pre-Kesler precedent" and restore the law to the "view . . . which this Court has traditionally taken" in older cases).

It is worth pointing out the difference between the applications of stare decisis in this case and in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833 (1992).
Casey explained how considerations of stare decisis inform
the decision whether to overrule a long-established precedent that has become integrated into the fabric of the law.
Overruling precedent of that kind naturally may have consequences for "the ideal of the rule of law," id., at 854. In
addition, such precedent is likely to have engendered substantial reliance, as was true in Casey itself, id., at 856
("[F]or two decades of economic and social developments,
people have organized intimate relationships and made
choices that define their views of themselves and their places
in society, in reliance on the availability of abortion in the
event that contraception should fail"). But in this case, as
we have explained, we do not face a precedent of that kind,
because Metro Broadcasting itself departed from our prior
cases--and did so quite recently. By refusing to follow

515us1$70j 08-25-98 19:19:32 PAGES OPINPGT
234 ADARAND CONSTRUCTORS, INC. v. PENA

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
Metro Broadcasting, then, we do not depart from the fabric
of the law; we restore it. We also note that reliance on a
case that has recently departed from precedent is likely to
be minimal, particularly where, as here, the rule set forth in
that case is unlikely to affect primary conduct in any event.
Cf. Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. v. Dobson, 513 U. S. 265, 272
(1995) (declining to overrule Southland Corp. v. Keating, 465
U. S. 1 (1984), where "private parties have likely written contracts relying upon Southland as authority" in the 10 years
since Southland was decided).

Justice Stevens takes us to task for what he perceives
to be an erroneous application of the doctrine of stare decisis.
But again, he misunderstands our position. We have acknowledged that, after Croson, "some uncertainty persisted
with respect to the standard of review for federal racial classifications," supra, at 223, and we therefore do not say that
we "merely restor[e] the status quo ante" today, post, at 257.

But as we have described supra, at 213-227, we think that
well-settled legal principles pointed toward a conclusion different from that reached in Metro Broadcasting, and we
therefore disagree with Justice Stevens that "the law at
the time of that decision was entirely open to the result the
Court reached," post, at 257. We also disagree with Justice Stevens that Justice Stewart's dissenting opinion in
Fullilove supports his "novelty" argument, see post, at 258-
259, and n. 13. Justice Stewart said that "[u]nder our Constitution, any official action that treats a person differently
on account of his race or ethnic origin is inherently suspect
and presumptively invalid," and that " `[e]qual protection
analysis in the Fifth Amendment area is the same as that
under the Fourteenth Amendment.' " Fullilove, 448 U. S.,
at 523, and n. 1. He took the view that "[t]he hostility of
the Constitution to racial classifications by government has
been manifested in many cases decided by this Court," and
that "our cases have made clear that the Constitution is

Opinion of the Court
wholly neutral in forbidding such racial discrimination, what-ever the race may be of those who are its victims." Id., at

524. Justice Stewart gave no indication that he thought hewas addressing a "novel" proposition, post, at 259. Rather,
he relied on the fact that the text of the Fourteenth Amend-ment extends its guarantee to "persons," and on cases like
Buckley, Loving, McLaughlin, Bolling, Hirabayashi, and
Korematsu, see Fullilove, supra, at 524-526, as do we today.There is nothing new about the notion that Congress, like

the States, may treat people differently because of their raceonly for compelling reasons.

"The real problem," Justice Frankfurter explained, "iswhether a principle shall prevail over its later misapplications." Helvering, 309 U. S., at 122. Metro Broadcasting'suntenable distinction between state and federal racial classifications lacks support in our precedent, and undermines thefundamental principle of equal protection as a personal right.
In this case, as between that principle and "its later misappli-cations," the principle must prevail.

D
Our action today makes explicit what Justice Powellthought implicit in the

Fullilove lead opinion: Federal racialclassifications, like those of a State, must serve a compelling

governmental interest, and must be narrowly tailored tofurther that interest. See

Fullilove, 448 U. S., at 496 (con-curring opinion). (Recall that the lead opinion in Fullilove

"d[id] not adopt . . . the formulas of analysis articulatedin such cases as [Bakke]." Id., at 492 (opinion of Burger,
C. J.).) Of course, it follows that to the extent (if any) that
Fullilove held federal racial classifications to be subject to aless rigorous standard, it is no longer controlling. But we

need not decide today whether the program upheld in Fullilove would survive strict scrutiny as our more recent cases
have defined it.

236 ADARAND CONSTRUCTORS, INC. v. PENA

Opinion of the Court
Some have questioned the importance of debating the
proper standard of review of race-based legislation. See,
e. g., post, at 247 (Stevens, J., dissenting); Croson, 488 U. S.,
at 514-515, and n. 5 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and
concurring in judgment); cf. Metro Broadcasting, 497 U. S.,
at 610 (O'Connor, J., dissenting) ("This dispute regarding
the appropriate standard of review may strike some as a
lawyers' quibble over words"). But we agree with Justice
Stevens that, "[b]ecause racial characteristics so seldom
provide a relevant basis for disparate treatment, and because
classifications based on race are potentially so harmful to the
entire body politic, it is especially important that the reasons
for any such classification be clearly identified and unquestionably legitimate," and that "[r]acial classifications are
simply too pernicious to permit any but the most exact connection between justification and classification." Fullilove,
supra, at 533-535, 537 (dissenting opinion) (footnotes omitted). We think that requiring strict scrutiny is the best way
to ensure that courts will consistently give racial classifications that kind of detailed examination, both as to ends and
as to means. Korematsu demonstrates vividly that even
"the most rigid scrutiny" can sometimes fail to detect an
illegitimate racial classification, compare Korematsu, 323
U. S., at 223 ("To cast this case into outlines of racial prejudice, without reference to the real military dangers which

Opinion of the Court
Finally, we wish to dispel the notion that strict scrutiny is"strict in theory, but fatal in fact." Fullilove, supra, at 519

(Marshall, J., concurring in judgment). The unhappy persis-tence of both the practice and the lingering effects of racial
discrimination against minority groups in this country is anunfortunate reality, and government is not disqualified from
acting in response to it. As recently as 1987, for example,every Justice of this Court agreed that the Alabama Department of Public Safety's "pervasive, systematic, and obstinatediscriminatory conduct" justified a narrowly tailored racebased remedy. See United States v. Paradise, 480 U. S., at167 (plurality opinion of Brennan, J.);

id., at 190 (Stevens,J., concurring in judgment);
id., at 196 (O'Connor, J., dissent-ing). When race-based action is necessary to further a compelling interest, such action is within constitutional con-straints if it satisfies the "narrow tailoring" test this Court
has set out in previous cases.

IV
Because our decision today alters the playing field in someimportant respects, we think it best to remand the case to

the lower courts for further consideration in light of the prin-ciples we have announced. The Court of Appeals, following
Metro Broadcasting and Fullilove, analyzed the case interms of intermediate scrutiny. It upheld the challenged
statutes and regulations because it found them to be "nar-rowly tailored to achieve [their] significant governmental
purpose of providing subcontracting opportunities for smalldisadvantaged business enterprises." 16 F. 3d, at 1547 (emphasis added). The Court of Appeals did not decide thequestion whether the interests served by the use of subcontractor compensation clauses are properly described as "compelling." It also did not address the question of narrow tai-loring in terms of our strict scrutiny cases, by asking, for

example, whether there was "any consideration of the use of

race-neutral means to increase minority business participa-tion" in government contracting,

Croson, supra, at 507, or
whether the program was appropriately limited such thatit "will not last longer than the discriminatory effects it is

designed to eliminate," Fullilove, supra, at 513 (Powell, J.,
concurring).Moreover, unresolved questions remain concerning the

details of the complex regulatory regimes implicated by theuse of subcontractor compensation clauses. For example,
the SBA's 8(a) program requires an individualized inquiryinto the economic disadvantage of every participant, see 13
CFR $ 124.106(a) (1994), whereas the DOT's regulations
implementing STURAA $ 106(c) do not require certifying
authorities to make such individualized inquiries, see 49
CFR $ 23.62 (1994); 49 CFR pt. 23, subpt. D, App. C (1994).
And the regulations seem unclear as to whether 8(d) subcontractors must make individualized showings, or instead
whether the race-based presumption applies both to social
and economic disadvantage, compare 13 CFR $ 124.106(b)
(1994) (apparently requiring 8(d) participants to make an
individualized showing), with 48 CFR $ 19.703(a)(2) (1994)
(apparently allowing 8(d) subcontractors to invoke the racebased presumption for social and economic disadvantage).
See generally Part I, supra. We also note an apparent discrepancy between the definitions of which socially disadvantaged individuals qualify as economically disadvantaged for
the 8(a) and 8(d) programs; the former requires a showing
that such individuals' ability to compete has been impaired
"as compared to others in the same or similar line of business
who are not socially disadvantaged," 13 CFR $ 124.106(a)
(1)(i) (1994) (emphasis added), while the latter requires that
showing only "as compared to others in the same or similar
line of business," $ 124.106(b)(1). The question whether any
of the ways in which the Government uses subcontractor
compensation clauses can survive strict scrutiny, and any
relevance distinctions such as these may have to that ques515us1$70j 08-25-98 19:19:32 PAGES OPINPGT

tion, should be addressed in the first instance by the lowercourts.

Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals isvacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings
consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Justice Scalia, concurring in part and concurring in thejudgment.

I join the opinion of the Court, except Part III-C, andexcept insofar as it may be inconsistent with the following:
In my view, government can never have a "compelling inter-est" in discriminating on the basis of race in order to "make
up" for past racial discrimination in the opposite direction.See

Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469, 520 (1989)
(Scalia, J., concurring in judgment). Individuals who have
been wronged by unlawful racial discrimination should be
made whole; but under our Constitution there can be no such
thing as either a creditor or a debtor race. That concept is
alien to the Constitution's focus upon the individual, see
Amdt. 14, $ 1 ("[N]or shall any State . . . deny to any person"
the equal protection of the laws) (emphasis added), and its
rejection of dispositions based on race, see Amdt. 15, $ 1 (prohibiting abridgment of the right to vote "on account of race"),
or based on blood, see Art. III, $ 3 ("[N]o Attainder of Treason shall work Corruption of Blood"); Art. I, $ 9, cl. 8 ("No
Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States"). To
pursue the concept of racial entitlement--even for the most
admirable and benign of purposes--is to reinforce and preserve for future mischief the way of thinking that produced
race slavery, race privilege and race hatred. In the eyes of
government, we are just one race here. It is American.

It is unlikely, if not impossible, that the challenged program would survive under this understanding of strict
scrutiny, but I am content to leave that to be decided on
remand.

Opinion of Thomas, J.
Justice Thomas, concurring in part and concurring inthe judgment.

I agree with the majority's conclusion that strict scrutinyapplies to all government classifications based on race. I
write separately, however, to express my disagreement withthe premise underlying

Justice Stevens' and Justice
Ginsburg's dissents: that there is a racial paternalism ex-ception to the principle of equal protection. I believe that

there is a "moral [and] constitutional equivalence," post, at243 (

Stevens, J., dissenting), between laws designed to sub-jugate a race and those that distribute benefits on the basis

of race in order to foster some current notion of equality.Government cannot make us equal; it can only recognize, respect, and protect us as equal before the law.That these programs may have been motivated, in part,
by good intentions cannot provide refuge from the principlethat under our Constitution, the government may not make
distinctions on the basis of race. As far as the Constitutionis concerned, it is irrelevant whether a government's racial
classifications are drawn by those who wish to oppress a raceor by those who have a sincere desire to help those thought
to be disadvantaged. There can be no doubt that the pater-nalism that appears to lie at the heart of this program is at
war with the principle of inherent equality that underliesand infuses our Constitution. See Declaration of Independence ("We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all menare created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator
with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life,Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness").

These programs not only raise grave constitutional questions, they also undermine the moral basis of the equal pro-tection principle. Purchased at the price of immeasurable

human suffering, the equal protection principle reflects ourNation's understanding that such classifications ultimately
have a destructive impact on the individual and our society.Unquestionably, "[i]nvidious [racial] discrimination is an en515us1$70n 08-25-98 19:19:33 PAGES OPINPGT

gine of oppression," post, at 243 (Stevens, J., dissenting).
It is also true that "[r]emedial" racial preferences may reflect
"a desire to foster equality in society," ibid. But there can
be no doubt that racial paternalism and its unintended consequences can be as poisonous and pernicious as any other
form of discrimination. So-called "benign" discrimination
teaches many that because of chronic and apparently immutable handicaps, minorities cannot compete with them without their patronizing indulgence. Inevitably, such programs
engender attitudes of superiority or, alternatively, provoke
resentment among those who believe that they have been
wronged by the government's use of race. These programs
stamp minorities with a badge of inferiority and may cause
them to develop dependencies or to adopt an attitude that
they are "entitled" to preferences. Indeed, Justice Stevens once recognized the real harms stemming from seemingly "benign" discrimination. See Fullilove v. Klutznick,
448 U. S. 448, 545 (1980) (Stevens, J., dissenting) (noting
that "remedial" race legislation "is perceived by many as
resting on an assumption that those who are granted this
special preference are less qualified in some respect that is
identified purely by their race").

In my mind, government-sponsored racial discrimination
based on benign prejudice is just as noxious as discrimination inspired by malicious prejudice.* In each instance, it is
racial discrimination, plain and simple.

*It should be obvious that every racial classification helps, in a narrow
sense, some races and hurts others. As to the races benefited, the classification could surely be called "benign." Accordingly, whether a law relying upon racial taxonomy is "benign" or "malign," post, at 275 (Ginsburg,

Stevens, J., dissenting
Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins,
dissenting.

Instead of deciding this case in accordance with controlling
precedent, the Court today delivers a disconcerting lecture
about the evils of governmental racial classifications. For
its text the Court has selected three propositions, represented by the bywords "skepticism," "consistency," and "congruence." See ante, at 223-224. I shall comment on each
of these propositions, then add a few words about stare decisis, and finally explain why I believe this Court has a duty
to affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.

I
The Court's concept of skepticism is, at least in principle,
a good statement of law and of common sense. Undoubtedly, a court should be wary of a governmental decision that
relies upon a racial classification. "Because racial characteristics so seldom provide a relevant basis for disparate treatment, and because classifications based on race are potentially so harmful to the entire body politic," a reviewing
court must satisfy itself that the reasons for any such classification are "clearly identified and unquestionably legitimate." Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U. S. 448, 533-535 (1980)
(Stevens, J., dissenting). This principle is explicit in Chief
Justice Burger's opinion, id., at 480; in Justice Powell's concurrence, id., at 496; and in my dissent in Fullilove, id., at
533-534. I welcome its renewed endorsement by the Court
today. But, as the opinions in Fullilove demonstrate, substantial agreement on the standard to be applied in deciding
difficult cases does not necessarily lead to agreement on how
those cases actually should or will be resolved. In my judgment, because uniform standards are often anything but uniform, we should evaluate the Court's comments on "consistency," "congruence," and stare decisis with the same type of
skepticism that the Court advocates for the underlying issue.

II
The Court's concept of "consistency" assumes that there isno significant difference between a decision by the majority

to impose a special burden on the members of a minorityrace and a decision by the majority to provide a benefit to
certain members of that minority notwithstanding its inci-dental burden on some members of the majority. In my
opinion that assumption is untenable. There is no moral orconstitutional equivalence between a policy that is designed
to perpetuate a caste system and one that seeks to eradicateracial subordination. Invidious discrimination is an engine
of oppression, subjugating a disfavored group to enhance ormaintain the power of the majority. Remedial race-based
preferences reflect the opposite impulse: a desire to fosterequality in society. No sensible conception of the Government's constitutional obligation to "govern impartially,"
Hampton v. Mow Sun Wong, 426 U. S. 88, 100 (1976), shouldignore this distinction.

1

1 As Justice Ginsburg observes, post, at 275-276, the majority's "flexible" approach to "strict scrutiny" may well take into account differences
between benign and invidious programs. The majority specifically notes
that strict scrutiny can accommodate " `relevant differences,' " ante, at 228;
surely the intent of a government actor and the effects of a program are
relevant to its constitutionality. See Missouri v. Jenkins, ante, at 112
(O'Connor, J., concurring) ("[T]ime and again, we have recognized the
ample authority legislatures possess to combat racial injustice . . . . It is
only by applying strict scrutiny that we can distinguish between unconstitutional discrimination and narrowly tailored remedial programs that legislatures may enact to further the compelling governmental interest in
redressing the effects of past discrimination").

Even if this is so, however, I think it is unfortunate that the majority
insists on applying the label "strict scrutiny" to benign race-based programs. That label has usually been understood to spell the death of any
governmental action to which a court may apply it. The Court suggests
today that "strict scrutiny" means something different--something less
strict--when applied to benign racial classifications. Although I agree
that benign programs deserve different treatment than invidious programs, there is a danger that the fatal language of "strict scrutiny" will

Stevens, J., dissenting
To illustrate the point, consider our cases addressingthe Federal Government's discrimination against JapaneseAmericans during World War II, Hirabayashi v. UnitedStates, 320 U. S. 81 (1943), and Korematsu v. United States,
323 U. S. 214 (1944). The discrimination at issue in those
cases was invidious because the Government imposed specialburdens--a curfew and exclusion from certain areas on the

West Coast 2--on the members of a minority class definedby racial and ethnic characteristics. Members of the same
racially defined class exhibited exceptional heroism in theservice of our country during that war. Now suppose Congress decided to reward that service with a federal programthat gave all Japanese-American veterans an extraordinary
preference in Government employment. Cf. Personnel
Administrator of Mass. v. Feeney, 442 U. S. 256 (1979). If
Congress had done so, the same racial characteristics that
motivated the discriminatory burdens in Hirabayashi and
Korematsu would have defined the preferred class of veterans. Nevertheless, "consistency" surely would not requireus to describe the incidental burden on everyone else in the

country as "odious" or "invidious" as those terms were usedin those cases. We should reject a concept of "consistency"
that would view the special preferences that the NationalGovernment has provided to Native Americans since 1834

3

skew the analysis and place well-crafted benign programs at unnecessary
risk.

2 These were, of course, neither the sole nor the most shameful burdens

the Government imposed on Japanese-Americans during that War. They
were, however, the only such burdens this Court had occasion to address
in Hirabayashi and Korematsu. See Korematsu, 323 U. S., at 223 ("Regardless of the true nature of the assembly and relocation centers . . . we
are dealing specifically with nothing but an exclusion order").

3 See Morton v. Mancari, 417 U. S. 535, 541 (1974). To be eligible for

the preference in 1974, an individual had to " `be one fourth or more degree
Indian blood and be a member of a Federally-recognized tribe.' " Id., at
553, n. 24, quoting 44 BIAM 335, 3.1 (1972). We concluded that the classi515us1$70i 08-25-98 19:19:33 PAGES OPINPGT

as comparable to the official discrimination against African-Americans that was prevalent for much of our history.

The consistency that the Court espouses would disregardthe difference between a "No Trespassing" sign and a welcome mat. It would treat a Dixiecrat Senator's decision tovote against Thurgood Marshall's confirmation in order to
keep African-Americans off the Supreme Court as on a parwith President Johnson's evaluation of his nominee's race as
a positive factor. It would equate a law that made blackcitizens ineligible for military service with a program aimed
at recruiting black soldiers. An attempt by the majority toexclude members of a minority race from a regulated market
is fundamentally different from a subsidy that enables a rela-tively small group of newcomers to enter that market. An
interest in "consistency" does not justify treating differencesas though they were similarities.

The Court's explanation for treating dissimilar race-baseddecisions as though they were equally objectionable is a
supposed inability to differentiate between "invidious" and"benign" discrimination.

Ante, at 225-226. But the term"affirmative action" is common and well understood. Its

presence in everyday parlance shows that people understandthe difference between good intentions and bad. As with
any legal concept, some cases may be difficult to classify,4 butour equal protection jurisprudence has identified a critical
difference between state action that imposes burdens on a
fication was not "racial" because it did not encompass all Native Americans. 417 U. S., at 553-554. In upholding it, we relied in part on the
plenary power of Congress to legislate on behalf of Indian tribes. Id., at
551-552. In this case respondents rely, in part, on the fact that not all
members of the preferred minority groups are eligible for the preference,
and on the special power to legislate on behalf of minorities granted to
Congress by $ 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.

4 For example, in Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469 (1989), a

majority of the members of the city council that enacted the race-based
set-aside were of the same race as its beneficiaries.

disfavored few and state action that benefits the few "in spiteof " its adverse effects on the many.

Feeney, 442 U. S., at
279.Indeed, our jurisprudence has made the standard to be

applied in cases of invidious discrimination turn on whether
the discrimination is "intentional," or whether, by contrast,it merely has a discriminatory "effect."

Washington v.
Davis, 426 U. S. 229 (1976). Surely this distinction is atleast as subtle, and at least as difficult to apply, see

id., at
253-254 (concurring opinion), as the usually obvious distinc-tion between a measure intended to benefit members of a

particular minority race and a measure intended to burden
a minority race. A state actor inclined to subvert the Constitution might easily hide bad intentions in the guise of unintended "effects"; but I should think it far more difficult to
enact a law intending to preserve the majority's hegemony
while casting it plausibly in the guise of affirmative action
for minorities.

Nothing is inherently wrong with applying a single standard to fundamentally different situations, as long as that
standard takes relevant differences into account. For example, if the Court in all equal protection cases were to insist
that differential treatment be justified by relevant characteristics of the members of the favored and disfavored classes
that provide a legitimate basis for disparate treatment, such
a standard would treat dissimilar cases differently while still
recognizing that there is, after all, only one Equal Protection
Clause. See Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc., 473
U. S. 432, 451-455 (1985) (Stevens, J., concurring); San Antonio Independent School Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U. S. 1, 98-
110 (1973) (Marshall, J., dissenting). Under such a standard,
subsidies for disadvantaged businesses may be constitutional
though special taxes on such businesses would be invalid.
But a single standard that purports to equate remedial preferences with invidious discrimination cannot be defended in
the name of "equal protection."

Stevens, J., dissenting
Moreover, the Court may find that its new "consistency"approach to race-based classifications is difficult to square

with its insistence upon rigidly separate categories for dis-crimination against different classes of individuals. For
example, as the law currently stands, the Court will apply"intermediate scrutiny" to cases of invidious gender discrimination and "strict scrutiny" to cases of invidious racediscrimination, while applying the same standard for benign
classifications as for invidious ones. If this remains thelaw, then today's lecture about "consistency" will produce
the anomalous result that the Government can more easilyenact affirmative-action programs to remedy discrimination
against women than it can enact affirmative-action programsto remedy discrimination against African-Americans--even
though the primary purpose of the Equal Protection Clausewas to end discrimination against the former slaves. See
Associated General Contractors of Cal., Inc. v. San Fran-cisco, 813 F. 2d 922 (CA9 1987) (striking down racial preference under strict scrutiny while upholding gender preferenceunder intermediate scrutiny). When a court becomes preoccupied with abstract standards, it risks sacrificing commonsense at the altar of formal consistency.

As a matter of constitutional and democratic principle, adecision by representatives of the majority to discriminate
against the members of a minority race is fundamentally dif-ferent from those same representatives' decision to impose
incidental costs on the majority of their constituents in orderto provide a benefit to a disadvantaged minority.

5 Indeed,

5 In his concurrence, Justice Thomas argues that the most significant
cost associated with an affirmative-action program is its adverse stigmatic
effect on its intended beneficiaries. Ante, at 240-241. Although I agree
that this cost may be more significant than many people realize, see Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U. S. 448, 545 (1980) (Stevens, J., dissenting), I do
not think it applies to the facts of this case. First, this is not an argument
that petitioner Adarand, a white-owned business, has standing to advance.
No beneficiaries of the specific program under attack today have challenged its constitutionality--perhaps because they do not find the prefer515us1$70i 08-25-98 19:19:33 PAGES OPINPGT

as I have previously argued, the former is virtually always
repugnant to the principles of a free and democratic society,
whereas the latter is, in some circumstances, entirely consistent with the ideal of equality. Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of
Ed., 476 U. S. 267, 316-317 (1986) (Stevens, J., dissenting).6

ences stigmatizing, or perhaps because their ability to opt out of the program provides them all the relief they would need. Second, even if the
petitioner in this case were a minority-owned business challenging the
stigmatizing effect of this program, I would not find Justice Thomas'
extreme proposition--that there is a moral and constitutional equivalence
between an attempt to subjugate and an attempt to redress the effects of
a caste system, ante, at 240--at all persuasive. It is one thing to question
the wisdom of affirmative-action programs: There are many responsible
arguments against them, including the one based upon stigma, that Congress might find persuasive when it decides whether to enact or retain
race-based preferences. It is another thing altogether to equate the
many well-meaning and intelligent lawmakers and their constituents--
whether members of majority or minority races--who have supported
affirmative action over the years, to segregationists and bigots.

Finally, although Justice Thomas is more concerned about the potential effects of these programs than the intent of those who enacted them
(a proposition at odds with this Court's jurisprudence, see Washington v.
Davis, 426 U. S. 229 (1976), but not without a strong element of common
sense, see id., at 252-256 (Stevens, J., concurring); id., at 256-270 (Brennan, J., dissenting)), I am not persuaded that the psychological damage
brought on by affirmative action is as severe as that engendered by racial
subordination. That, in any event, is a judgment the political branches
can be trusted to make. In enacting affirmative-action programs, a legislature intends to remove obstacles that have unfairly placed individuals of
equal qualifications at a competitive disadvantage. See Fullilove, 448
U. S., at 521 (Marshall, J., concurring in judgment). I do not believe such
action, whether wise or unwise, deserves such an invidious label as "racial
paternalism," ante, at 240 (opinion of Thomas, J.). If the legislature is
persuaded that its program is doing more harm than good to the individuals it is designed to benefit, then we can expect the legislature to remedy
the problem. Significantly, this is not true of a government action based
on invidious discrimination.

6 As I noted in Wygant:

"There is . . . a critical difference between a decision to exclude a member of a minority race because of his or her skin color and a decision

Stevens, J., dissenting
By insisting on a doctrinaire notion of "consistency" in thestandard applicable to all race-based governmental actions,

the Court obscures this essential dichotomy.

III
The Court's concept of "congruence" assumes that there isno significant difference between a decision by the Congress

of the United States to adopt an affirmative-action programand such a decision by a State or a municipality. In my
opinion that assumption is untenable. It ignores importantpractical and legal differences between federal and state or
local decisionmakers.These differences have been identified repeatedly and consistently both in opinions of the Court and in separate opin-ions authored by Members of today's majority. Thus, in
Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC, 497 U. S. 547 (1990), inwhich we upheld a federal program designed to foster racial
diversity in broadcasting, we identified the special "instituto include more members of the minority in a school faculty for that
reason.

"The exclusionary decision rests on the false premise that differences in
race, or in the color of a person's skin, reflect real differences that are
relevant to a person's right to share in the blessings of a free society. As
noted, that premise is `utterly irrational,' Cleburne v. Cleburne Living
Center, 473 U. S. 432, 452 (1985), and repugnant to the principles of a free
and democratic society. Nevertheless, the fact that persons of different
races do, indeed have differently colored skin, may give rise to a belief
that there is some significant difference between such persons. The inclusion of minority teachers in the educational process inevitably tends to
dispel that illusion whereas their exclusion could only tend to foster it.
The inclusionary decision is consistent with the principle that all men are
created equal; the exclusionary decision is at war with that principle. One
decision accords with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment; the other does not. Thus, consideration of whether the consciousness of race is exclusionary or inclusionary plainly distinguishes the
Board's valid purpose in this case from a race-conscious decision that
would reinforce assumptions of inequality." 476 U. S., at 316-317 (dissenting opinion).

careful to emphasize, "that the FCC's minority ownershipprograms have been specifically approved--indeed, mandated--by Congress." Ibid. We recalled the several opinions in Fullilove that admonished this Court to " `approachour task with appropriate deference to the Congress, a coequal branch charged by the Constitution with the power to"provide for the . . . general Welfare of the United States"
and "to enforce, by appropriate legislation," the equal pro-tection guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment.' [

recalled that the opinions of Chief Justice Burger and Justice
Powell in Fullilove had "explained that deference was appropriate in light of Congress' institutional competence as
the National Legislature, as well as Congress' powers under
the Commerce Clause, the Spending Clause, and the Civil
War Amendments." 497 U. S., at 563 (citations and footnote omitted).

The majority in Metro Broadcasting and the plurality in

between federal and state programs. In his separate opinion in Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469, 520-524
(1989), Justice Scalia discussed the basis for this distinction. He observed that "it is one thing to permit racially
based conduct by the Federal Government--whose legislative powers concerning matters of race were explicitly enhanced by the Fourteenth Amendment, see U. S. Const.,
Amdt. 14, $ 5--and quite another to permit it by the precise
entities against whose conduct in matters of race that
Amendment was specifically directed, see Amdt. 14, $ 1."
Id., at 521-522. Continuing, Justice Scalia explained why
a "sound distinction between federal and state (or local) action based on race rests not only upon the substance of the

Civil War Amendments, but upon social reality and governmental theory." Id., at 522.

"What the record shows, in other words, is that racial
discrimination against any group finds a more ready expression at the state and local than at the federal level.
To the children of the Founding Fathers, this should
come as no surprise. An acute awareness of the heightened danger of oppression from political factions
in small, rather than large, political units dates to the
very beginning of our national history. See G. Wood,
The Creation of the American Republic, 1776-1787,
pp. 499-506 (1969). As James Madison observed in
support of the proposed Constitution's enhancement of
national powers:

" `The smaller the society, the fewer probably will be the
distinct parties and interests composing it; the fewer the
distinct parties and interests, the more frequently will
a majority be found of the same party; and the smaller
the number of individuals composing a majority, and the
smaller the compass within which they are placed, the
more easily will they concert and execute their plan of
oppression. Extend the sphere and you take in a
greater variety of parties and interests; you make it less
probable that a majority of the whole will have a common motive to invade the rights of other citizens; or if
such a common motive exists, it will be more difficult for
all who feel it to discover their own strength and to act
in unison with each other.' The Federalist No. 10,
pp. 82-84 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961)." Id., at 523 (opinion
concurring in judgment).

In her plurality opinion in Croson, Justice O'Connor also
emphasized the importance of this distinction when she responded to the city's argument that Fullilove was controlling. She wrote:

Stevens, J., dissenting
"What appellant ignores is that Congress, unlike any
State or political subdivision, has a specific constitutional mandate to enforce the dictates of the Fourteenth
Amendment. The power to `enforce' may at times also
include the power to define situations which Congress
determines threaten principles of equality and to adopt
prophylactic rules to deal with those situations. The
Civil War Amendments themselves worked a dramatic
change in the balance between congressional and state
power over matters of race." 488 U. S., at 490 ( joined
by Rehnquist, C. J., and White, J.) (citations omitted).

An additional reason for giving greater deference to the
National Legislature than to a local lawmaking body is that
federal affirmative-action programs represent the will of our
entire Nation's elected representatives, whereas a state or
local program may have an impact on nonresident entities
who played no part in the decision to enact it. Thus, in the
state or local context, individuals who were unable to vote
for the local representatives who enacted a race-conscious
program may nonetheless feel the effects of that program.
This difference recalls the goals of the Commerce Clause,
U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 8, cl. 3, which permits Congress to legislate on certain matters of national importance while denying power to the States in this area for fear of undue impact
upon out-of-state residents. See Southern Pacific Co. v. Arizona ex rel. Sullivan, 325 U. S. 761, 767-768, n. 2 (1945)
("[T]o the extent that the burden of state regulation falls on
interests outside the state, it is unlikely to be alleviated by
the operation of those political restraints normally exerted
when interests within the state are affected").

Ironically, after all of the time, effort, and paper this Court
has expended in differentiating between federal and state
affirmative action, the majority today virtually ignores the
issue. See ante, at 230-231. It provides not a word of direct explanation for its sudden and enormous departure from

Stevens, J., dissenting
the reasoning in past cases. Such silence, however, cannot
erase the difference between Congress' institutional competence and constitutional authority to overcome historic racial
subjugation and the States' lesser power to do so.

Presumably, the majority is now satisfied that its theory
of "congruence" between the substantive rights provided by
the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments disposes of the objection based upon divided constitutional powers. But it is one
thing to say (as no one seems to dispute) that the Fifth
Amendment encompasses a general guarantee of equal protection as broad as that contained within the Fourteenth
Amendment. It is another thing entirely to say that Congress' institutional competence and constitutional authority
entitles it to no greater deference when it enacts a program
designed to foster equality than the deference due a state
legislature.7 The latter is an extraordinary proposition; and,
as the foregoing discussion demonstrates, our precedents
have rejected it explicitly and repeatedly.8

7 Despite the majority's reliance on Korematsu v. United States, 323
U. S. 214 (1944), ante, at 214-215, that case does not stand for the proposition that federal remedial programs are subject to strict scrutiny. Instead, Korematsu specifies that "all legal restrictions which curtail the
civil rights of a single racial group are immediately suspect." 323 U. S.,
at 216, quoted ante, at 214 (emphasis added). The programs at issue in
this case (as in most affirmative-action cases) do not "curtail the civil
rights of a single racial group"; they benefit certain racial groups and impose an indirect burden on the majority.

8 We have rejected this proposition outside of the affirmative-action context as well. In Hampton v. Mow Sun Wong, 426 U. S. 88, 100 (1976),
we held:

"The federal sovereign, like the States, must govern impartially. The
concept of equal justice under law is served by the Fifth Amendment's
guarantee of due process, as well as by the Equal Protection Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment. Although both Amendments require the same
type of analysis, see Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 93 [(1976)], the Court
of Appeals correctly stated that the two protections are not always coextensive. Not only does the language of the two Amendments differ, but
more importantly, there may be overriding national interests which justify

Our opinion in Metro Broadcasting relied on several constitutional provisions to justify the greater deference we owe
to Congress when it acts with respect to private individuals.
497 U. S., at 563. In the programs challenged in this case,
Congress has acted both with respect to private individuals
and, as in Fullilove, with respect to the States themselves.9
When Congress does this, it draws its power directly from

$ 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.10 That section reads:

selective federal legislation that would be unacceptable for an individual
State. On the other hand, when a federal rule is applicable to only a
limited territory, such as the District of Columbia, or an insular possession,
and when there is no special national interest involved, the Due Process
Clause has been construed as having the same significance as the Equal
Protection Clause."

9 The funding for the preferences challenged in this case comes from the

Surface Transportation and Uniform Relocation Assistance Act of 1987
(STURAA), 101 Stat. 132, in which Congress has granted funds to the
States in exchange for a commitment to foster subcontracting by disadvantaged business enterprises, or "DBE's." STURAA is also the source of
funding for DBE preferences in federal highway contracting. Approximately 98% of STURAA's funding is allocated to the States. Brief for
Respondents 38, n. 34. Moreover, under STURAA States are empowered
to certify businesses as "disadvantaged" for purposes of receiving subcontracting preferences in both state and federal contracts. STURAA

$ 106(c)(4), 101 Stat. 146.

In this case, Adarand has sued only the federal officials responsible for
implementing federal highway contracting policy; it has not directly challenged DBE preferences granted in state contracts funded by STURAA.
It is not entirely clear, then, whether the majority's "congruence" rationale
would apply to federally regulated state contracts, which may conceivably
be within the majority's view of Congress' $ 5 authority even if the federal
contracts are not. See Metro Broadcasting, 497 U. S., at 603-604 (O'Connor, J., dissenting). As I read the majority's opinion, however, it draws
no distinctions between direct federal preferences and federal preferences
achieved through subsidies to States. The extent to which STURAA intertwines elements of direct federal regulations with elements of federal
conditions on grants to the States would make such a distinction difficult
to sustain.

10 Because Congress has acted with respect to the States in enacting

STURAA, we need not revisit today the difficult question of $ 5's application to pure federal regulation of individuals.

"The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate
legislation, the provisions of this article." One of the "provisions of this article" that Congress is thus empowered to
enforce reads: "No State shall make or enforce any law
which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens
of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person
of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor
deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws." U. S. Const., Amdt. 14, $ 1. The Fourteenth Amendment directly empowers Congress at the same
time it expressly limits the States.11 This is no accident. It
represents our Nation's consensus, achieved after hard experience throughout our sorry history of race relations, that
the Federal Government must be the primary defender of
racial minorities against the States, some of which may be
inclined to oppress such minorities. A rule of "congruence"
that ignores a purposeful "incongruity" so fundamental to
our system of government is unacceptable.

In my judgment, the Court's novel doctrine of "congruence" is seriously misguided. Congressional deliberations
about a matter as important as affirmative action should be
accorded far greater deference than those of a State or
municipality.

IV

The Court's concept of stare decisis treats some of the language we have used in explaining our decisions as though it

11 We have read $ 5 as a positive grant of authority to Congress, not just
to punish violations, but also to define and expand the scope of the Equal
Protection Clause. Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U. S. 641 (1966). In Katzenbach, this meant that Congress under $ 5 could require the States to
allow non-English-speaking citizens to vote, even if denying such citizens a
vote would not have been an independent violation of $ 1. Id., at 648-651.
Congress, then, can expand the coverage of $ 1 by exercising its power
under $ 5 when it acts to foster equality. Congress has done just that
here; it has decided that granting certain preferences to minorities best
serves the goals of equal protection.

were more important than our actual holdings. In my opin-ion that treatment is incorrect.

This is the third time in the Court's entire historythat it has considered the constitutionality of a federal
affirmative-action program. On each of the two prior occa-sions, the first in 1980,

Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U. S. 448,and the second in 1990, Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC, 497

U. S. 547, the Court upheld the program. Today the Courtexplicitly overrules Metro Broadcasting (at least in part),
ante, at 227, and undermines Fullilove by recasting thestandard on which it rested and by calling even its holding
into question, ante, at 235. By way of explanation, Justice
O'Connor advises the federal agencies and private partiesthat have made countless decisions in reliance on those cases

that "we do not depart from the fabric of the law; we restoreit." Ante, at 234. A skeptical observer might ask whether
this pronouncement is a faithful application of the doctrineof stare decisis.

12 A brief comment on each of the two ailing

cases may provide the answer.In the Court's view, our decision in Metro Broadcasting

was inconsistent with the rule announced in Richmond v.J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469 (1989). Ante, at 225-226.
But two decisive distinctions separate those two cases.First, Metro Broadcasting involved a federal program,
whereas Croson involved a city ordinance. Metro Broadcasting thus drew primary support from Fullilove, whichpredated Croson and which Croson distinguished on the

grounds of the federal-state dichotomy that the majoritytoday discredits. Although Members of today's majority
trumpeted the importance of that distinction in Croson, theynow reject it in the name of "congruence." It is therefore

12 Our skeptical observer might also notice that Justice O'Connor's
explanation for departing from settled precedent is joined only by Justice
Kennedy. Ante, at 204. Three Members of the majority thus provide
no explanation whatsoever for their unwillingness to adhere to the doctrine of stare decisis.

quite wrong for the Court to suggest today that overruling
Metro Broadcasting merely restores the status quo ante, for
the law at the time of that decision was entirely open to theresult the Court reached.

Today's decision is an unjustified
departure from settled law.

Second, Metro Broadcasting's holding rested on more thanits application of "intermediate scrutiny." Indeed, I have

always believed that, labels notwithstanding, the FederalCommunications Commission (FCC) program we upheld in
that case would have satisfied any of our various standardsin affirmative-action cases--including the one the majority
fashions today. What truly distinguishes Metro Broadcasting from our other affirmative-action precedents is the distinctive goal of the federal program in that case. Instead
of merely seeking to remedy past discrimination, the FCC
program was intended to achieve future benefits in the form
of broadcast diversity. Reliance on race as a legitimate
means of achieving diversity was first endorsed by Justice
Powell in Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U. S. 265,
311-319 (1978). Later, in Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Ed., 476
U. S. 267 (1986), I also argued that race is not always irrelevant to governmental decisionmaking, see id., at 314-315
(Stevens, J., dissenting); in response, Justice O'Connor
correctly noted that, although the school board had relied on
an interest in providing black teachers to serve as role models for black students, that interest "should not be confused
with the very different goal of promoting racial diversity
among the faculty." Id., at 288, n. She then added that,
because the school board had not relied on an interest in
diversity, it was not "necessary to discuss the magnitude of
that interest or its applicability in this case." Ibid.

Thus, prior to Metro Broadcasting, the interest in diversity had been mentioned in a few opinions, but it is perfectly
clear that the Court had not yet decided whether that interest had sufficient magnitude to justify a racial classification.
Metro Broadcasting, of course, answered that question in the

258 ADARAND CONSTRUCTORS, INC. v. PENA

Stevens, J., dissenting
affirmative. The majority today overrules Metro Broadcasting only insofar as it is "inconsistent with [the] holding"
that strict scrutiny applies to "benign" racial classifications
promulgated by the Federal Government. Ante, at 227.
The proposition that fostering diversity may provide a sufficient interest to justify such a program is not inconsistent
with the Court's holding today--indeed, the question is not
remotely presented in this case--and I do not take the
Court's opinion to diminish that aspect of our decision in
Metro Broadcasting.

The Court's suggestion that it may be necessary in the
future to overrule Fullilove in order to restore the fabric
of the law, ante, at 235, is even more disingenuous than its
treatment of Metro Broadcasting. For the Court endorses
the "strict scrutiny" standard that Justice Powell applied in
Bakke, see ante, at 224, and acknowledges that he applied
that standard in Fullilove as well, ante, at 218-219. Moreover, Chief Justice Burger also expressly concluded that the
program we considered in Fullilove was valid under any of
the tests articulated in Bakke, which of course included Justice Powell's. 448 U. S., at 492. The Court thus adopts a
standard applied in Fullilove at the same time it questions
that case's continued vitality and accuses it of departing from
prior law. I continue to believe that the Fullilove case was
incorrectly decided, see id., at 532-554 (Stevens, J., dissenting), but neither my dissent nor that filed by Justice Stewart,
id., at 522-532, contained any suggestion that the issue the
Court was resolving had been decided before.13 As was true

13 Of course, Justice Stewart believed that his view, disapproving of racial classifications of any kind, was consistent with this Court's precedents.
See ante, at 234-235, citing 448 U. S., at 523-526. But he did not claim
that the question whether the Federal Government could engage in raceconscious affirmative action had been decided before Fullilove. The fact
that a Justice dissents from an opinion means that he disagrees with the
result; it does not usually mean that he believes the decision so departs
from the fabric of the law that its reasoning ought to be repudiated at the

of Metro Broadcasting, the Court in Fullilove decided animportant, novel, and difficult question. Providing a different answer to a similar question today cannot fairly be char-acterized as merely "restoring" previously settled law.

V
The Court's holding in Fullilove surely governs the resultin this case. The Public Works Employment Act of 1977

(1977 Act), 91 Stat. 116, which this Court upheld in Fullilove,is different in several critical respects from the portions of
the Small Business Act (SBA), 72 Stat. 384, as amended, 15U. S. C. $ 631

et seq., and STURAA, 101 Stat. 132, challengedin this case. Each of those differences makes the current

program designed to provide assistance to DBE's signifi-cantly less objectionable than the 1977 categorical grant of
$400 million in exchange for a 10% set-aside in public con-tracts to "a class of investors defined solely by racial characteristics." Fullilove, 448 U. S., at 532 (Stevens, J., dissent-ing). In no meaningful respect is the current scheme more
objectionable than the 1977 Act. Thus, if the 1977 Act wasconstitutional, then so must be the SBA and STURAA. Indeed, even if my dissenting views in Fullilove had prevailed,this program would be valid.

Unlike the 1977 Act, the present statutory scheme doesnot make race the sole criterion of eligibility for participation
in the program. Race does give rise to a rebuttablepresumption of social disadvantage which, at least under
STURAA,14 gives rise to a second rebuttable presumption
next opportunity. Much less does a dissent bind or authorize a later majority to reject a precedent with which it disagrees.

14 STURAA accords a rebuttable presumption of both social and economic disadvantage to members of racial minority groups. 49 CFR

$ 23.62 (1994). In contrast, $ 8(a) of the SBA accords a presumption only
of social disadvantage, 13 CFR $ 124.105(b) (1995); the applicant has the
burden of demonstrating economic disadvantage, id., $ 124.106. Finally,

$ 8(d) of the SBA accords at least a presumption of social disadvantage,
but it is ambiguous as to whether economic disadvantage is presumed or

260 ADARAND CONSTRUCTORS, INC. v. PENA

Stevens, J., dissenting
of economic disadvantage. 49 CFR $ 23.62 (1994). But asmall business may qualify as a DBE, by showing that it is

both socially and economically disadvantaged, even if it re-ceives neither of these presumptions. 13 CFR $$ 124.105(c),
124.106 (1995); 48 CFR $ 19.703 (1994); 49 CFR pt. 23, subpt.D., Apps. A and C (1994). Thus, the current preference is
more inclusive than the 1977 Act because it does not makerace a necessary qualification.

More importantly, race is not a sufficient qualification.Whereas a millionaire with a long history of financial successes, who was a member of numerous social clubs and tradeassociations, would have qualified for a preference under the
1977 Act merely because he was an Asian-American or anAfrican-American, see Fullilove, 448 U. S., at 537-538, 540,
543-544, and n. 16, 546 (Stevens, J., dissenting), neither theSBA nor STURAA creates any such anomaly. The DBE
program excludes members of minority races who are not,in fact, socially or economically disadvantaged.

15 13 CFR

$ 124.106(a)(ii) (1995); 49 CFR $ 23.69 (1994). The presump-tion of social disadvantage reflects the unfortunate fact that

irrational racial prejudice--along with its lingering effects--still survives.

16 The presumption of economic disadvantage

must be shown. See 15 U. S. C. $ 637(d)(3) (1988 ed. and Supp. V); 13 CFR

$ 124.601 (1995).

15 The Government apparently takes this exclusion seriously. See

Autek Systems Corp. v. United States, 835 F. Supp. 13 (DC 1993) (upholding Small Business Administration decision that minority business owner's
personal income disqualified him from DBE status under $ 8(a) program),
aff'd, 43 F. 3d 712 (CADC 1994).

16 "The unhappy persistence of both the practice and the lingering

effects of racial discrimination against minority groups in this country
is an unfortunate reality, and government is not disqualified from acting
in response to it." Ante, at 237.

"Our findings clearly state that groups such as black Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Native Americans, have been and continue to be
discriminated against and that this discrimination has led to the social
disadvantagement of persons identified by society as members of those
groups." 124 Cong. Rec. 34097 (1978)

embodies a recognition that success in the private sector of
the economy is often attributable, in part, to social skills and
relationships. Unlike the 1977 set-asides, the current preference is designed to overcome the social and economic
disadvantages that are often associated with racial characteristics. If, in a particular case, these disadvantages are
not present, the presumptions can be rebutted. 13 CFR

$$ 124.601-124.610 (1995); 49 CFR $ 23.69 (1994). The program is thus designed to allow race to play a part in the
decisional process only when there is a meaningful basis for
assuming its relevance. In this connection, I think it is particularly significant that the current program targets the negotiation of subcontracts between private firms. The 1977
Act applied entirely to the award of public contracts, an area
of the economy in which social relationships should be irrelevant and in which proper supervision of government contracting officers should preclude any discrimination against
particular bidders on account of their race. In this case, in
contrast, the program seeks to overcome barriers of prejudice between private parties--specifically, between general
contractors and subcontractors. The SBA and STURAA
embody Congress' recognition that such barriers may actually handicap minority firms seeking business as subcontractors from established leaders in the industry that have a history of doing business with their golfing partners. Indeed,
minority subcontractors may face more obstacles than direct,
intentional racial prejudice: They may face particular barriers simply because they are more likely to be new in the
business and less likely to know others in the business.
Given such difficulties, Congress could reasonably find that
a minority subcontractor is less likely to receive favors from
the entrenched businesspersons who award subcontracts
only to people with whom--or with whose friends--they
have an existing relationship. This program, then, if in part
a remedy for past discrimination, is most importantly a

Stevens, J., dissenting
forward-looking response to practical problems faced by mi-nority subcontractors.

The current program contains another forward-lookingcomponent that the 1977 set-asides did not share. Section
8(a) of the SBA provides for periodic review of the status ofDBE's, 15 U. S. C. $$ 637(a)(B)-(C) (1988 ed., Supp. V); 13
CFR $ 124.602(a) (1995),17 and DBE status can be challengedby a competitor at any time under any of the routes to certification. 13 CFR $ 124.603 (1995); 49 CFR $ 23.69 (1994).Such review prevents ineligible firms from taking part in
the program solely because of their minority ownership, even
when those firms were once disadvantaged but have sincebecome successful. The emphasis on review also indicates

the Administration's anticipation that after their presumed
disadvantages have been overcome, firms will "graduate"into a status in which they will be able to compete for business, including prime contracts, on an equal basis. 13 CFR$ 124.208 (1995). As with other phases of the statutory policy of encouraging the formation and growth of small busi-ness enterprises, this program is intended to facilitate entry
and increase competition in the free market.Significantly, the current program, unlike the 1977 setaside, does not establish any requirement--numerical or otherwise--that a general contractor must hire DBE subcon-tractors. The program we upheld in

Fullilove required that
10% of the federal grant for every federally funded projectbe expended on minority business enterprises. In contrast,

the current program contains no quota. Although it pro-vides monetary incentives to general contractors to hire
DBE subcontractors, it does not require them to hire DBE's,

17 The Department of Transportation strongly urges States to institute
periodic review of businesses certified as DBE's under STURAA, 49 CFR
pt. 23, subpt. D, App. A (1994), but it does not mandate such review. Respondents point us to no provisions for review of $ 8(d) certification, although such review may be derivative for those businesses that receive

$ 8(d) certification as a result of $ 8(a) or STURAA certification.

and they do not lose their contracts if they fail to do so. Theimportance of this incentive to general contractors (who always seek to offer the lowest bid) should not be underesti-mated; but the preference here is far less rigid, and thus
more narrowly tailored, than the 1977 Act. Cf. Bakke, 438
U. S., at 319-320 (opinion of Powell, J.) (distinguishing be-tween numerical set-asides and consideration of race as a

factor).Finally, the record shows a dramatic contrast between the
sparse deliberations that preceded the 1977 Act, see Fullilove, 448 U. S., at 549-550 (Stevens, J., dissenting), and the
extensive hearings conducted in several Congresses beforethe current program was developed.

evaluate the benefits and costs--both fiscal and social--ofthis or any other affirmative-action program, our obligation

to give deference to Congress' policy choices is much moredemanding in this case than it was in Fullilove. If the 1977
program of race-based set-asides satisfied the strict scrutinydictated by Justice Powell's vision of the Constitution--a vision the Court expressly endorses today--it must follow asnight follows the day that the Court of Appeals' judgment
upholding this more carefully crafted program should beaffirmed.

VI
My skeptical scrutiny of the Court's opinion leaves me indissent. The majority's concept of "consistency" ignores a

difference, fundamental to the idea of equal protection, be-tween oppression and assistance. The majority's concept of
"congruence" ignores a difference, fundamental to our consti-tutional system, between the Federal Government and the
States. And the majority's concept of stare decisis ignoresthe force of binding precedent. I would affirm the judgment
of the Court of Appeals.

Justice Souter, with whom Justice Ginsburg and
Justice Breyer join, dissenting.

As this case worked its way through the federal courtsprior to the grant of certiorari that brought it here, petitioner Adarand Constructors, Inc., was understood to haveraised only one significant claim: that before a federal agency
may exceed the goals adopted by Congress in implementinga race-based remedial program, the Fifth and Fourteenth
Amendments require the agency to make specific findings of

discrimination, as under Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488U. S. 469 (1989), sufficient to justify surpassing the congressional objective. See 16 F. 3d 1537, 1544 (CA10 1994) ("Thegravamen of Adarand's argument is that the CFLHD must
make particularized findings of past discrimination to justify
its race-conscious SCC program under Croson because theprecise goals of the challenged SCC program were fashioned

and specified by an agency and not by Congress"); Adarand
Constructors, Inc. v. Skinner, 790 F. Supp. 240, 242 (Colo.
1992) ("Plaintiff 's motion for summary judgment seeks a de-claratory judgment and permanent injunction against the

DOT, the FHA and the CFLHD until specific findings of discrimination are made by the defendants as allegedly required by City of Richmond v. Croson"); cf. Complaint || 28,
App. 20 (federal regulations violate the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments by requiring "the use of racial and gender preferences in the award of federally financed highway
construction contracts, without any findings of past discrimination in the award of such contracts").

Although the petition for certiorari added an antecedent
question challenging the use, under the Fifth and Fourteenth
Amendments, of any standard below strict scrutiny to judge
the constitutionality of the statutes under which respondents
acted, I would not have entertained that question in this
case. The statutory scheme must be treated as constitutional if Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U. S. 448 (1980), is applied, and petitioner did not identify any of the factual premises on which Fullilove rested as having disappeared since
that case was decided.

As the Court's opinion explains in detail, the scheme in
question provides financial incentives to general contractors
to hire subcontractors who have been certified as disadvantaged business enterprises (DBE's) on the basis of certain
race-based presumptions. See generally ante, at 206-208.
These statutes (or the originals, of which the current ones
are reenactments) have previously been justified as provid515us1$70m 08-25-98 19:19:33 PAGES OPINPGT

ing remedies for the continuing effects of past discrimina-tion, see, e. g., Fullilove, supra, at 465-466 (citing legislative

history describing SBA $ 8(a) as remedial); S. Rep. No. 100-4,p. 11 (1987) (Committee Report stating that the DBE provision of STURAA was "necessary to remedy the discrimina-tion faced by socially and economically disadvantaged persons"), and the Government has so defended them in thiscase, Brief for Respondents 33. Since petitioner has not
claimed the obsolescence of any particular fact on which the
Fullilove Court upheld the statute, no issue has come up tous that might be resolved in a way that would render Fullilove inapposite. See, e. g., 16 F. 3d, at 1544 ("Adarand hasstipulated that section 502 of the Small Business Act . . .
satisfies the evidentiary requirements of Fullilove"); Memo-randum of Points and Authorities in Support of Plaintiff 's
Motion for Summary Judgment in No. 90-C-1413 (D. Colo.),p. 12 (

Fullilove is not applicable to the case at bar because"[f]irst and foremost, Fullilove stands for only one proposition relevant here: the ability of the U. S. Congress, undercertain limited circumstances, to adopt a race-base[d]
remedy").In these circumstances, I agree with

Justice Stevens'sconclusion that stare decisis compels the application of Fullilove. Although Fullilove did not reflect doctrinal consis-tency, its several opinions produced a result on shared
grounds that petitioner does not attack: that discriminationin the construction industry had been subject to government
acquiescence, with effects that remain and that may be ad-dressed by some preferential treatment falling within the
congressional power under $ 5 of the Fourteenth Amend-ment.

1 Fullilove, 448 U. S., at 477-478 (opinion of Burger,

when the National Government makes a construction contract directly as
when it funnels construction money through the States. In any event, as
Justice Stevens has noted, see ante, at 247-248, n. 5, 248-249, n. 6, it is

C. J.); id., at 503 (Powell, J., concurring); id., at 520-521 (Mar-shall, J., concurring in judgment). Once Fullilove is applied, as Justice Stevens points out, it follows that thestatutes in question here (which are substantially better tailored to the harm being remedied than the statute endorsedin

Fullilove, see ante, at 259-264 (Stevens, J., dissenting))pass muster under Fifth Amendment due process and Fourteenth Amendment equal protection.The Court today, however, does not reach the application
of Fullilove to the facts of this case, and on remand it willbe incumbent on the Government and petitioner to address
anew the facts upon which statutes like these must be judgedon the Government's remedial theory of justification: facts
about the current effects of past discrimination, the necessityfor a preferential remedy, and the suitability of this particular preferential scheme. Petitioner could, of course, haveraised all of these issues under the standard employed by
the Fullilove plurality, and without now trying to read thecurrent congressional evidentiary record that may bear on
resolving these issues I have to recognize the possibility thatproof of changed facts might have rendered Fullilove's conclusion obsolete as judged under the Fullilove plurality'sown standard. Be that as it may, it seems fair to ask
whether the statutes will meet a different fate from whatFullilove would have decreed. The answer is, quite probably not, though of course there will be some interpretiveforks in the road before the significance of strict scrutiny for
congressional remedial statutes becomes entirely clear.The result in

Fullilove was controlled by the plurality forwhom Chief Justice Burger spoke in announcing the judgment. Although his opinion did not adopt any label for thestandard it applied, and although it was later seen as calling
for less than strict scrutiny, Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v.
not clear whether the current challenge implicates only Fifth Amendment
due process or Fourteenth Amendment equal protection as well.

Souter, J., dissenting
FCC, 497 U. S. 547, 564 (1990), none other than Justice Powelljoined the plurality opinion as comporting with his own view

that a strict scrutiny standard should be applied to all injuri-ous race-based classifications.

Fullilove, supra, at 495-496
(concurring opinion) ("Although I would place greater emphasis than The Chief Justice on the need to articulatejudicial standards of review in conventional terms, I view his

opinion announcing the judgment as substantially in accordwith my views"). Chief Justice Burger's noncategorical approach is probably best seen not as more lenient than strictscrutiny but as reflecting his conviction that the treble-tiered
scrutiny structure merely embroidered on a single standard
of reasonableness whenever an equal protection challenge
required a balancing of justification against probable harm.
See Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc., 473 U. S. 432,
451 (1985) (Stevens, J., concurring, joined by Burger, C. J.).
Indeed, the Court's very recognition today that strict scrutiny can be compatible with the survival of a classification so
reviewed demonstrates that our concepts of equal protection
enjoy a greater elasticity than the standard categories might
suggest. See ante, at 237 ("[W]e wish to dispel the notion
that strict scrutiny is `strict in theory, but fatal in fact.'
Fullilove, supra, at 519 (Marshall, J., concurring in judgment)"); see also Missouri v. Jenkins, ante, at 112 (O'Connor, J., concurring) ("But it is not true that strict scrutiny
is `strict in theory, but fatal in fact' ").

In assessing the degree to which today's holding portends
a departure from past practice, it is also worth noting that
nothing in today's opinion implies any view of Congress's $ 5
power and the deference due its exercise that differs from
the views expressed by the Fullilove plurality. The Court
simply notes the observation in Croson "that the Court's
`treatment of an exercise of congressional power in Fullilove
cannot be dispositive here,' because Croson's facts did not
implicate Congress's broad power under $ 5 of the Fourteenth
Amendment," ante, at 222, and explains that there is dis515us1$70m 08-25-98 19:19:33 PAGES OPINPGT

Souter, J., dissenting
agreement among today's majority about the extent of the$ 5 power,

ante, at 230-231. There is therefore no reason to
treat the opinion as affecting one way or another the viewsof $ 5 power, described as "broad,"

ante, at 269, "unique,"
Fullilove, 448 U. S., at 500 (Powell, J., concurring), and "unlike [that of] any state or political subdivision," Croson, 488U. S., at 490 (opinion of

O'Connor, J.). See also Jenkins,
ante, at 113 (O'Connor, J., concurring) ("Congress . . . enjoys` "discretion in determining whether and what legislation is

needed to secure the guarantees of the Fourteenth Amend-ment," '

Croson, 488 U. S., at 490 (quoting Katzenbach v.
Morgan, 384 U. S., at 651)"). Thus, today's decision should
leave $ 5 exactly where it is as the source of an interest of
the National Government sufficiently important to satisfy
the corresponding requirement of the strict scrutiny test.

Finally, I should say that I do not understand that today's
decision will necessarily have any effect on the resolution of
an issue that was just as pertinent under Fullilove's unlabeled standard as it is under the standard of strict scrutiny
now adopted by the Court. The Court has long accepted
the view that constitutional authority to remedy past discrimination is not limited to the power to forbid its continuation, but extends to eliminating those effects that would
otherwise persist and skew the operation of public systems
even in the absence of current intent to practice any discrimination. See Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U. S. 405,
418 (1975) ("Where racial discrimination is concerned, `the
[district] court has not merely the power but the duty to
render a decree which will so far as possible eliminate the
discriminatory effects of the past as well as bar like discrimination in the future' "), quoting Louisiana v. United States,
380 U. S. 145, 154 (1965). This is so whether the remedial
authority is exercised by a court, see ibid.; Green v. School
Bd. of New Kent Cty., 391 U. S. 430, 437 (1968), the Congress,
see Fullilove, supra, at 502 (Powell, J., concurring), or
some other legislature, see Croson, supra, at 491-492 (opin515us1$70m 08-25-98 19:19:33 PAGES OPINPGT

Souter, J., dissenting
ion of O'Connor, J.). Indeed, a majority of the Court todayreiterates that there are circumstances in which Government

may, consistently with the Constitution, adopt programsaimed at remedying the effects of past invidious discrimination. See, e. g., ante, at 228-229, 237 (opinion of O'Connor,
J.); ante, at 243 (Stevens, J., with whom Ginsburg, J., joins,dissenting);

post, at 273, 275-276 (Ginsburg, J., with whom
Breyer, J., joins, dissenting); Jenkins, ante, at 112 (O'Connor, J., concurring) (noting the critical difference "between
unconstitutional discrimination and narrowly tailored reme-dial programs that legislatures may enact to further the

compelling governmental interest in redressing the effects
of past discrimination").

When the extirpation of lingering discriminatory effects
is thought to require a catchup mechanism, like the racially
preferential inducement under the statutes considered here,
the result may be that some members of the historically
favored race are hurt by that remedial mechanism, however
innocent they may be of any personal responsibility for any
discriminatory conduct. When this price is considered reasonable, it is in part because it is a price to be paid only
temporarily; if the justification for the preference is eliminating the effects of a past practice, the assumption is that the
effects will themselves recede into the past, becoming attenuated and finally disappearing. Thus, Justice Powell wrote
in his concurring opinion in Fullilove that the "temporary
nature of this remedy ensures that a race-conscious program
will not last longer than the discriminatory effects it is designed to eliminate." 448 U. S., at 513; ante, at 237-238
(opinion of the Court).

Surely the transition from the Fullilove plurality view (in
which Justice Powell joined) to today's strict scrutiny (which
will presumably be applied as Justice Powell employed it)
does not signal a change in the standard by which the burden
of a remedial racial preference is to be judged as reasonable
or not at any given time. If in the District Court Adarand

had chosen to press a challenge to the reasonableness of the
burden of these statutes,2 more than a decade after Fullilove
had examined such a burden, I doubt that the claim would
have fared any differently from the way it will now be
treated on remand from this Court.

Justice Ginsburg, with whom Justice Breyer joins,
dissenting.

For the reasons stated by Justice Souter, and in view of
the attention the political branches are currently giving the
matter of affirmative action, I see no compelling cause for
the intervention the Court has made in this case. I further
agree with Justice Stevens that, in this area, large deference is owed by the Judiciary to "Congress' institutional
competence and constitutional authority to overcome historic
racial subjugation." Ante, at 253 (Stevens, J., dissenting);
see ante, at 254-255.1 I write separately to underscore not

the differences the several opinions in this case display, but
the considerable field of agreement--the common understandings and concerns--revealed in opinions that together
speak for a majority of the Court.

2 I say "press a challenge" because petitioner's Memorandum in Support
of Summary Judgment did include an argument challenging the reasonableness of the duration of the statutory scheme; but the durational claim
was not, so far as I am aware, stated elsewhere, and, in any event, was
not the gravamen of the complaint.

see, e. g., Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, 379 U. S. 241, 286

he travels interstate or intrastate."); id., at 291, 293 (Goldberg, J., concurring) ("primary purpose of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 . . . is the vindication of human dignity"; "Congress clearly had authority under both $ 5 of

The statutes and regulations at issue, as the Court indi-cates, were adopted by the political branches in response to

an "unfortunate reality": "[t]he unhappy persistence of boththe practice and the lingering effects of racial discrimination
against minority groups in this country." Ante, at 237 (leadopinion). The United States suffers from those lingering effects because, for most of our Nation's history, the idea that"we are just one race," ante, at 239 (

Scalia, J., concurring inpart and concurring in judgment), was not embraced. For

generations, our lawmakers and judges were unprepared tosay that there is in this land no superior race, no race inferior
to any other. In Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U. S. 537 (1896),not only did this Court endorse the oppressive practice of
race segregation, but even Justice Harlan, the advocate of a"color-blind" Constitution, stated:

"The white race deems itself to be the dominant racein this country. And so it is, in prestige, in achievements, in education, in wealth and in power. So,I doubt not, it will continue to be for all time, if it remains true to its great heritage and holds fast to theprinciples of constitutional liberty." Id., at 559 (dissenting opinion).
Not until Loving v. Virginia, 388 U. S. 1 (1967), which heldunconstitutional Virginia's ban on interracial marriages,

could one say with security that the Constitution and thisCourt would abide no measure "designed to maintain White
Supremacy." Id., at 11.2

2 The Court, in 1955 and 1956, refused to rule on the constitutionality of
antimiscegenation laws; it twice declined to accept appeals from the decree
on which the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals relied in Loving. See
Naim v. Naim, 197 Va. 80, 87 S. E. 2d 749, vacated and remanded, 350
U. S. 891 (1955), reinstated and aff'd, 197 Va. 734, 90 S. E. 2d 849, appeal

legislative purpose served by the Virginia law: "to preserve the racial
integrity of [Virginia's] citizens"; to prevent "the corruption of blood," "a

The divisions in this difficult case should not obscure theCourt's recognition of the persistence of racial inequality and

a majority's acknowledgment of Congress' authority to actaffirmatively, not only to end discrimination, but also to counteract discrimination's lingering effects. Ante, at 237 (lead

II
The lead opinion uses one term, "strict scrutiny," to de-scribe the standard of judicial review for all governmental

classifications by race. Ante, at 235-237. But that opin-ion's elaboration strongly suggests that the strict standard
announced is indeed "fatal" for classifications burdeninggroups that have suffered discrimination in our society.
That seems to me, and, I believe, to the Court, the enduringlesson one should draw from

Korematsu v. United States,323 U. S. 214 (1944); for in that case, scrutiny the Court described as "most rigid," id., at 216, nonetheless yielded a passfor an odious, gravely injurious racial classification. See
ante, at 214-215 (lead opinion). A Korematsu-type classifi-cation, as I read the opinions in this case, will never again
survive scrutiny: Such a classification, history and precedentinstruct, properly ranks as prohibited.

For a classification made to hasten the day when "we arejust one race," ante, at 239 (

Scalia, J., concurring in partand concurring in judgment), however, the lead opinion has

dispelled the notion that "strict scrutiny" is " `fatal in fact.' "
Ante, at 237 (quoting Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U. S. 448,519 (1980) (Marshall, J., concurring in judgment)). Properly,

a majority of the Court calls for review that is searching,in order to ferret out classifications in reality malign, but
masquerading as benign. See ante, at 228-229 (lead opin-ion). The Court's once lax review of sex-based classifications demonstrates the need for such suspicion. See, e. g.,
Hoyt v. Florida, 368 U. S. 57, 60 (1961) (upholding women's"privilege" of automatic exemption from jury service);

Goesaert v. Cleary, 335 U. S. 464 (1948) (upholding Michigan
law barring women from employment as bartenders); seealso Johnston & Knapp, Sex Discrimination by Law: A Study

in Judicial Perspective, 46 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 675 (1971). To-day's decision thus usefully reiterates that the purpose of
strict scrutiny "is precisely to distinguish legitimate from

illegitimate uses of race in governmental decisionmaking,"ante, at 228 (lead opinion), "to `differentiate between' permissible and impermissible governmental use of race," ibid.,to distinguish " `between a "No Trespassing" sign and a welcome mat,' " ante, at 229.Close review also is in order for this further reason. As
Justice Souter points out, ante, at 270 (dissenting opinion),and as this very case shows, some members of the historically favored race can be hurt by catchup mechanisms de-signed to cope with the lingering effects of entrenched racial
subjugation. Court review can ensure that preferences arenot so large as to trammel unduly upon the opportunities of
others or interfere too harshly with legitimate expectationsof persons in once-preferred groups. See, e. g., Bridgeport
Guardians, Inc. v. Bridgeport Civil Service Comm'n, 482F. 2d 1333, 1341 (CA2 1973).

* * *
While I would not disturb the programs challenged in thiscase, and would leave their improvement to the political

branches, I see today's decision as one that allows our prece-dent to evolve, still to be informed by and responsive to
changing conditions.

Texas oil and gas properties. After a verdict was entered against respondents and they notified petitioners that they intended to file a state
court suit on the policies, petitioners sought a declaratory judgment
in federal court that their policies did not cover respondents' liability.
Respondents filed their state court suit and moved to dismiss or, in the
alternative, to stay petitioners' action. The District Court entered a
stay on the ground that the state suit encompassed the same coverage
issues raised in the federal action, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Noting that a district court has broad discretion to grant or decline to
grant declaratory judgment, the court did not require application of the
test articulated in Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United
States, 424 U. S. 800, and Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury
Constr. Corp., 460 U. S. 1, under which district courts must point to
"exceptional circumstances" to justify staying or dismissing federal proceedings. The court reviewed the District Court's decision for abuse
of discretion, and found none.

Held:

1. The discretionary standard of Brillhart v. Excess Ins. Co. of
America, 316 U. S. 491, governs a district court's decision to stay a declaratory judgment action during the pendency of parallel state court
proceedings. Pp. 282-288.

(a) In addressing circumstances virtually identical to those present
here, the Court in Brillhart made clear that district courts possess discretion in determining whether and when to entertain an action under
the Declaratory Judgment Act (Act), even when the suit otherwise satisfies subject matter jurisdiction. While Brillhart did not set out an exclusive list of factors governing the exercise of this discretion, it did
provide some guidance, indicating that, at least where another suit involving the same parties and presenting opportunity for ventilation of
the same state law issues is pending in state court, a district court might
be indulging in gratuitous interference if it permitted the federal declaratory action to proceed. Pp. 282-283.

Syllabus
(b) The Act's distinct features justify a standard vesting district
courts with greater discretion in declaratory judgment actions than that
permitted under the "exceptional circumstances" test set forth in Colorado River and Moses H. Cone, neither of which dealt with declaratory
judgments. On its face, the Act makes a textual commitment to discretion by specifying that a court "may" declare litigants' rights, 28 U. S. C.

$ 2201(a) (emphasis added), and it has repeatedly been characterized as
an enabling Act, which confers a discretion on the courts rather than an
absolute right upon the litigant. Pp. 283-287.

(c) Petitioners' argument that, despite the unique breadth of this
discretion, district courts lack discretion to decline to hear a declaratory
judgment suit at the outset depends on the untenable proposition that
a court, knowing at the litigation's commencement that it will exercise
its discretion to decline declaratory relief, must nonetheless go through
the futile exercise of hearing a case on the merits first. Nothing in the
Act recommends this reading, and the Court is unwilling to impute to
Congress an intention to require such a wasteful expenditure of judicial
resources. Pp. 287-288.

2. District courts' decisions about the propriety of hearing declaratory judgment actions should be reviewed for abuse of discretion, not
de novo. It is more consistent with the Act to vest district courts with
discretion in the first instance, because facts bearing on the declaratory
judgment remedy's usefulness, and the case's fitness for resolution, are
particularly within their grasp. Proper application of the abuse of discretion standard on appeal can provide appropriate guidance to district
courts. Pp. 288-289.

3. The District Court acted within its bounds in staying the declaratory relief action in this case, since parallel proceedings, presenting opportunity for ventilation of the same state law issues, were underway
in state court. Pp. 289-290.

Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case asks whether the discretionary standard setforth in

Brillhart v. Excess Ins. Co. of America, 316 U. S.491 (1942), or the "exceptional circumstances" test developed

in Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. UnitedStates, 424 U. S. 800 (1976), and Moses H. Cone Memorial
Hospital v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U. S. 1 (1983), gov-erns a district court's decision to stay a declaratory judgment action during the pendency of parallel state court pro-ceedings, and under what standard of review a court of
appeals should evaluate the district court's decision to do so.

I
In early 1992, a dispute between respondents (the HillGroup) and other parties over the ownership and operation

of oil and gas properties in Winkler County, Texas, appearedlikely to culminate in litigation. The Hill Group asked petitioners (London Underwriters) 1 to provide them with cover-age under several commercial liability insurance policies.
London Underwriters refused to defend or indemnify theHill Group in a letter dated July 31, 1992. In September
1992, after a 3-week trial, a Winkler County jury entered averdict in excess of $100 million against the Hill Group on
various state law claims.The Hill Group gave London Underwriters notice of the
verdict in late November 1992. On December 9, 1992, Lon*Laura A. Foggan, Daniel E. Troy, and Thomas W. Brunner filed a
brief for the Insurance Environmental Litigation Association as amicus
curiae urging reversal.

Edward F. LeBreton III filed a brief for the Maritime Law Association
as amicus curiae.

Opinion of the Court
don Underwriters filed suit in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of Texas, basing jurisdiction
upon diversity of citizenship under 28 U. S. C. $ 1332. London Underwriters sought a declaration under the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U. S. C. $ 2201(a) (1988 ed., Supp. V),
that their policies did not cover the Hill Group's liability for
the Winkler County judgment. After negotiations with the
Hill Group's counsel, London Underwriters voluntarily dismissed the action on January 22, 1993. London Underwriters did so, however, upon the express condition that the Hill
Group give London Underwriters two weeks' notice if they
decided to bring suit on the policy.

On February 23, 1993, the Hill Group notified London Underwriters of their intention to file such a suit in Travis
County, Texas. London Underwriters refiled their declaratory judgment action in the Southern District of Texas on
February 24, 1993. As promised, the Hill Group initiated an
action against London Underwriters on March 26, 1993, in
state court in Travis County. The Hill Group's codefendants
in the Winkler County litigation joined in this suit and asserted claims against certain Texas insurers, thus rendering
the parties nondiverse and the suit nonremovable.

On the same day that the Hill Group filed their Travis
County action, they moved to dismiss or, in the alternative,
to stay London Underwriters' federal declaratory judgment
action. After receiving submissions from the parties on the
issue, the District Court entered a stay on June 30, 1993.
The District Court observed that the state lawsuit pending
in Travis County encompassed the same coverage issues
raised in the declaratory judgment action and determined
that a stay was warranted in order to avoid piecemeal litigation and to bar London Underwriters' attempts at forum
shopping. London Underwriters filed a timely appeal. See
Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital, supra, at 10 (a district
court's order staying federal proceedings in favor of pending

state litigation is a "final decisio[n]" appealable under 28U. S. C. $ 1291).

The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuitaffirmed. 41 F. 3d 934 (1994). Noting that under Circuit
precedent, "[a] district court has broad discretion to grant
(or decline to grant) declaratory judgment," id., at 935, citing
Torch, Inc. v. LeBlanc, 947 F. 2d 193, 194 (CA5 1991), the
Court of Appeals did not require application of the test artic-ulated in

Colorado River, supra, and Moses H. Cone, supra,
under which district courts must point to "exceptional cir-cumstances" to justify staying or dismissing federal proceedings. Citing the interests in avoiding duplicative proceedings and forum shopping, the Court of Appeals reviewed the
District Court's decision for abuse of discretion, and found
none. 41 F. 3d, at 935.

We granted certiorari, 513 U. S. 1013 (1994), to resolve Circuit conflicts concerning the standard governing a district
court's decision to stay a declaratory judgment action in
favor of parallel state litigation, compare, e. g., Employers

n. 3 (CA8 1994) (pursuant to Colorado River and Moses H.

judgment action absent "exceptional circumstances"); Lumbermens Mut. Casualty Co. v. Connecticut Bank & Trust,

(same). We now affirm. II

Over 50 years ago, in Brillhart v. Excess Ins. Co. ofAmerica, 316 U. S. 491 (1942), this Court addressed circumstances virtually identical to those present in the case beforeus today. An insurer, anticipating a coercive suit, sought a
declaration in federal court of nonliability on an insurancepolicy. The District Court dismissed the action in favor of
pending state garnishment proceedings, to which the insurerhad been added as a defendant. The Court of Appeals reversed, finding an abuse of discretion, and ordered the Dis-trict Court to proceed to the merits. Reversing the Court
of Appeals and remanding to the District Court, this Courtheld that, "[a]lthough the District Court had jurisdiction of
the suit under the Federal Declaratory Judgments Act, itwas under no compulsion to exercise that jurisdiction." Id.,
at 494. The Court explained that "[o]rdinarily it would beuneconomical as well as vexatious for a federal court to proceed in a declaratory judgment suit where another suit ispending in a state court presenting the same issues, not governed by federal law, between the same parties." Id., at495. The question for a district court presented with a suit
under the Declaratory Judgment Act, the Court found, is"whether the questions in controversy between the parties
to the federal suit, and which are not foreclosed under theapplicable substantive law, can better be settled in the proceeding pending in the state court." Ibid.

Brillhart makes clear that district courts possess discre-tion in determining whether and when to entertain an action

under the Declaratory Judgment Act, even when the suitotherwise satisfies subject matter jurisdictional prerequisites. Although Brillhart did not set out an exclusive list offactors governing the district court's exercise of this discretion, it did provide some useful guidance in that regard.

515us1$71z 05-02-97 11:51:59 PAGES OPINPGT

283Cite as: 515 U. S. 277 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
The Court indicated, for example, that in deciding whetherto enter a stay, a district court should examine "the scope of

the pending state court proceeding and the nature of de-fenses open there."

Ibid. This inquiry, in turn, entails consideration of "whether the claims of all parties in interest
can satisfactorily be adjudicated in that proceeding, whethernecessary parties have been joined, whether such parties are

amenable to process in that proceeding, etc." Ibid. Othercases, the Court noted, might shed light on additional factors
governing a district court's decision to stay or to dismiss adeclaratory judgment action at the outset. See

ibid. But
Brillhart indicated that, at least where another suit involving the same parties and presenting opportunity for ventilation of the same state law issues is pending in state court, a
district court might be indulging in "[g]ratuitous interference," ibid., if it permitted the federal declaratory action to
proceed.

Brillhart, without more, clearly supports the District
Court's decision in this case. (That the court here stayed,
rather than dismissed, the action is of little moment in this
regard, because the state court's decision will bind the parties under principles of res judicata.) Nonetheless, London
Underwriters argue, and several Courts of Appeals have
agreed, that intervening case law has supplanted Brillhart's
notions of broad discretion with a test under which district
courts may stay or dismiss actions properly within their
jurisdiction only in "exceptional circumstances." In London
Underwriters' view, recent cases have established that a district court must point to a compelling reason--which, they
say, is lacking here--in order to stay a declaratory judgment
action in favor of pending state proceedings. To evaluate
this argument, it is necessary to examine three cases handed
down several decades after Brillhart.

In Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United
States, 424 U. S. 800 (1976), the Government brought an action in Federal District Court under 28 U. S. C. $ 1345 seek515us1$71z 05-02-97 11:51:59 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
ing a declaration of its water rights, the appointment of awater master, and an order enjoining all uses and diversions

of water by other parties. See Pet. for Cert. in Colorado
River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States, O. T. 1974,
No. 74-940, pp. 39a-40a. The District Court dismissed the
action in deference to ongoing state proceedings. TheCourt of Appeals reversed, 504 F. 2d 115 (CA10 1974), on

the ground that the District Court had jurisdiction over theGovernment's suit and that abstention was inappropriate.
This Court reversed again. Without discussing Brillhart,the Court began with the premise that federal courts have a
"virtually unflagging obligation" to exercise the jurisdiction
conferred on them by Congress. Colorado River, supra, at
813, 817-818, citing Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 404
(1821). The Court determined, however, that a district
court could nonetheless abstain from the assumption of jurisdiction over a suit in "exceptional" circumstances, and it
found such exceptional circumstances on the facts of the case.
424 U. S., at 818-820. Specifically, the Court deemed dispositive a clear federal policy against piecemeal adjudication of
water rights; the existence of an elaborate state scheme for
resolution of such claims; the absence of any proceedings in
the District Court, other than the filing of the complaint,
prior to the motion to dismiss; the extensive nature of the
suit; the 300-mile distance between the District Court and
the situs of the water district at issue; and the prior participation of the Federal Government in related state
proceedings.

Two years after Colorado River we decided Will v. Calvert Fire Ins. Co., 437 U. S. 655 (1978), in which a plurality
of the Court stated that, while " `the pendency of an action
in the state court is no bar to proceedings concerning the
same matter in the Federal court having jurisdiction,' " id.,
at 662, quoting McClellan v. Carland, 217 U. S. 268, 282
(1910), a district court is " `under no compulsion to exercise
that jurisdiction,' " 437 U. S., at 662, quoting Brillhart, 316

285Cite as: 515 U. S. 277 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
U. S., at 494. Will concerned an action seeking damages foran alleged violation of federal securities laws brought in federal court during the pendency of related state proceedings.Although the case arose outside the declaratory judgment
context, the plurality invoked Brillhart as the appropriate
authority. Colorado River, according to the plurality, "in noway undermine[d] the conclusion of

Brillhart that the decision whether to defer to the concurrent jurisdiction of a statecourt is, in the last analysis, a matter committed to the

district court's discretion." Will, supra, at 664. JusticeBlackmun, concurring in the judgment, criticized the plurality for not recognizing that Colorado River had undercut the
"sweeping language" of Brillhart. 437 U. S., at 667. Four
Justices in dissent urged that the Colorado River "exceptional circumstances" test supplied the governing standard.

The plurality's suggestion in Will that Brillhart might
have application beyond the context of declaratory judgments was rejected by the Court in Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U. S. 1 (1983).
In Moses H. Cone, the Court established that the Colorado
River "exceptional circumstances" test, rather than the more
permissive Brillhart analysis, governs a district court's decision to stay a suit to compel arbitration under $ 4 of the Arbitration Act in favor of pending state litigation. Noting that
the combination of Justice Blackmun and the four dissenting
Justices in Will had made five to require application of Colorado River, the Court rejected the argument that Will had
worked any substantive changes in the law. " `Abdication of
the obligation to decide cases,' " the Court reasoned, " `can
be justified . . . only in the exceptional circumstance where
the order to the parties to repair to the State court would
clearly serve an important countervailing interest.' " 460
U. S., at 14, quoting Colorado River, supra, at 813. As it
had in Colorado River, the Court articulated nonexclusive
factors relevant to the existence of such exceptional circumstances, including the assumption by either court of jurisdic515us1$71z 05-02-97 11:51:59 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
tion over a res, the relative convenience of the fora, avoid-ance of piecemeal litigation, the order in which jurisdiction

was obtained by the concurrent fora, whether and to whatextent federal law provides the rules of decision on the merits, and the adequacy of state proceedings. Evaluating each
of these factors, the Court concluded that the DistrictCourt's stay of federal proceedings was, under the circumstances, inappropriate.Relying on these postBrillhart developments, London
Underwriters contend that the Brillhart regime, underwhich district courts have substantial latitude in deciding

whether to stay or to dismiss a declaratory judgment suit
in light of pending state proceedings (and need not point to
"exceptional circumstances" to justify their actions), is an
outmoded relic of another era. We disagree. Neither Colorado River, which upheld the dismissal of federal proceedings, nor Moses H. Cone, which did not, dealt with actions
brought under the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U. S. C.

$ 2201(a) (1988 ed., Supp. V). Distinct features of the Declaratory Judgment Act, we believe, justify a standard vesting district courts with greater discretion in declaratory
judgment actions than that permitted under the "exceptional
circumstances" test of Colorado River and Moses H. Cone.
No subsequent case, in our view, has called into question the
application of the Brillhart standard to the Brillhart facts.

Since its inception, the Declaratory Judgment Act has
been understood to confer on federal courts unique and substantial discretion in deciding whether to declare the rights
of litigants. On its face, the statute provides that a court
"may declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration," 28 U. S. C. $ 2201(a)
(1988 ed., Supp. V) (emphasis added). See generally E.
Borchard, Declaratory Judgments 312-314 (2d ed. 1941);
Borchard, Discretion to Refuse Jurisdiction of Actions for
Declaratory Judgments, 26 Minn. L. Rev. 677 (1942). The
statute's textual commitment to discretion, and the breadth

of leeway we have always understood it to suggest, distin-guish the declaratory judgment context from other areas of

the law in which concepts of discretion surface. See gener-ally Shapiro, Jurisdiction and Discretion, 60 N. Y. U. L. Rev.
543 (1985); cf. O. Fiss & D. Rendleman, Injunctions 106-108
(2d ed. 1984) (describing courts' nonstatutory discretion,through application of open-ended substantive standards like

"irreparable injury," in the injunction context). We have re-peatedly characterized the Declaratory Judgment Act as "an
enabling Act, which confers a discretion on the courts ratherthan an absolute right upon the litigant."

Public Serv.
Comm'n of Utah v. Wycoff Co., 344 U. S. 237, 241 (1952); see
also Green v. Mansour, 474 U. S. 64, 72 (1985); Cardinal
Chemical Co. v. Morton Int'l, Inc., 508 U. S. 83, 95, n. 17
(1993). When all is said and done, we have concluded, "the
propriety of declaratory relief in a particular case will depend upon a circumspect sense of its fitness informed by the
teachings and experience concerning the functions and extent of federal judicial power." Wycoff, supra, at 243.

Acknowledging, as they must, the unique breadth of this
discretion to decline to enter a declaratory judgment, London Underwriters nonetheless contend that, after Colorado
River and Moses H. Cone, district courts lack discretion to
decline to hear a declaratory judgment suit at the outset.
See Brief for Petitioners 22 ("District courts must hear declaratory judgment cases absent exceptional circumstances;
district courts may decline to enter the requested relief
following a full trial on the merits, if no beneficial purpose
is thereby served or if equity otherwise counsels"). We are
not persuaded by this distinction. London Underwriters'
argument depends on the untenable proposition that a district court, knowing at the commencement of litigation that
it will exercise its broad statutory discretion to decline declaratory relief, must nonetheless go through the futile exercise of hearing a case on the merits first. Nothing in the
language of the Declaratory Judgment Act recommends Lon515us1$71z 05-02-97 11:51:59 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
don Underwriters' reading, and we are unwilling to imputeto Congress an intention to require such a wasteful expenditure of judicial resources. If a district court, in the soundexercise of its judgment, determines after a complaint is filed
that a declaratory judgment will serve no useful purpose, itcannot be incumbent upon that court to proceed to the merits
before staying or dismissing the action.We agree, for all practical purposes, with Professor Borchard, who observed half a century ago that "[t]here is . . .nothing automatic or obligatory about the assumption of `jurisdiction' by a federal court" to hear a declaratory judgmentaction. Borchard, Declaratory Judgments, at 313. By the
Declaratory Judgment Act, Congress sought to place a reme-dial arrow in the district court's quiver; it created an opportunity, rather than a duty, to grant a new form of relief toqualifying litigants. Consistent with the nonobligatory nature of the remedy, a district court is authorized, in thesound exercise of its discretion, to stay or to dismiss an action seeking a declaratory judgment before trial or after allarguments have drawn to a close.

2 In the declaratory judgment context, the normal principle that federal courts shouldadjudicate claims within their jurisdiction yields to considerations of practicality and wise judicial administration.

III
As Judge Friendly observed, the Declaratory JudgmentAct "does not speak," on its face, to the question whether

discretion to entertain declaratory judgment actions isvested in district courts alone or in the entire judicial system. Friendly, Indiscretion about Discretion, 31 Emory L.

2 We note that where the basis for declining to proceed is the pendency
of a state proceeding, a stay will often be the preferable course, because
it assures that the federal action can proceed without risk of a time bar if
the state case, for any reason, fails to resolve the matter in controversy.
See, e. g., P. Bator, D. Meltzer, P. Mishkin, & D. Shapiro, Hart and Wechsler's The Federal Courts and the Federal System 1451, n. 9 (3d ed. 1988).

J. 747, 778 (1982). The Court of Appeals reviewed the Dis-trict Court's decision to stay London Underwriters' action

for abuse of discretion, and found none. London Underwrit-ers urge us to follow those other Courts of Appeals that review decisions to grant (or to refrain from granting) declara-tory relief

de novo. See, e. g., Genentech, Inc. v. Eli Lilly &Co., 998 F. 2d, at 936; Cincinnati Ins. Co. v. Holbrook, 867

F. 2d, at 1333. We decline this invitation. We believe itmore consistent with the statute to vest district courts with
discretion in the first instance, because facts bearing on theusefulness of the declaratory judgment remedy, and the fitness of the case for resolution, are peculiarly within theirgrasp. Cf.

First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514U. S. 938, 948 (1995) ("[T]he reviewing attitude that a court

of appeals takes toward a district court decision should de-pend upon `the respective institutional advantages of trial
and appellate courts' ") (citation omitted); Miller v. Fenton,474 U. S. 104, 114 (1985) ("[T]he fact/law distinction at times
has turned on a determination that, as a matter of the soundadministration of justice, one judicial actor is better positioned than another to decide the issue in question"). Whileit may be true that sound administration of the Declaratory
Judgment Act calls for the exercise of "judicial discretion,hardened by experience into rule," Borchard, Declaratory
Judgments, at 293, proper application of the abuse of discre-tion standard on appellate review can, we think, provide appropriate guidance to district courts. In this regard, we re-ject London Underwriters' suggestion, Brief for Petitioners
14, that review for abuse of discretion "is tantamount to noreview" at all.

IV
In sum, we conclude that Brillhart v. Excess Ins. Co. of
America, 316 U. S. 491 (1942), governs this declaratory judg-ment action and that district courts' decisions about the propriety of hearing declaratory judgment actions, which arenecessarily bound up with their decisions about the propri515us1$71z 05-02-97 11:51:59 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
ety of granting declaratory relief, should be reviewed forabuse of discretion. We do not attempt at this time to delineate the outer boundaries of that discretion in other cases,for example, cases raising issues of federal law or cases in
which there are no parallel state proceedings. Like theCourt of Appeals, we conclude only that the District Court
acted within its bounds in staying this action for declaratoryrelief where parallel proceedings, presenting opportunity for

Syllabus

METROPOLITAN STEVEDORE CO. v. RAMBO et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 94-820. Argued April 25, 1995--Decided June 12, 1995
Respondent Rambo received a disability award under the Longshore and

Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA) for an injury he sustained while working for petitioner as a longshore frontman. Subsequently, he acquired new skills and obtained longshore work as a crane
operator, earning more than three times his preinjury earnings, though
his physical condition remained unchanged. Petitioner filed an application to modify the disability award under LHWCA $ 22 on the ground
that there had been a "change in conditions" so that Rambo was no
longer disabled. An Administrative Law Judge terminated the disability payments, and the Benefits Review Board affirmed, relying on its
1984 Fleetwood decision that a change in wage-earning capacity is a
change in conditions under $ 22. The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that $ 22 authorizes modification only where there has been a change
in an employee's physical condition.

Held: A disability award may be modified under $ 22 where there is a

change in an employee's wage-earning capacity, even without any
change in the employee's physical condition. Pp. 294-303.

(a) A narrow reading of the phrase "change in conditions" is not supported by the Act's language, structure, and purpose. Section 22's use
of the plural "conditions" suggests that Congress did not intend to limit
the bases for modifying awards to a single condition, such as an employee's physical health. Rather, under the normal or natural reading, the
applicable "conditions" are those that entitled the employee to benefits
in the first place, the same conditions on which continuing entitlement
is predicated. This interpretation is confirmed by the language of
LHWCA $$ 2(10) and 8(c)(21), which make it clear that compensation, as
an initial matter, is predicated on loss of wage-earning capacity and
should continue only while the incapacity to earn wages persists. Thus,
disability is in essence an economic, not a medical, concept. The Act's
fundamental purpose is to compensate employees for wage-earning capacity lost because of injury; where that capacity has been reduced,
restored, or improved, the basis for compensation changes and modification is permitted. Pp. 294-298.

(b) The legislative history also does not support a narrow construction of $ 22. Congress' decision to maintain a 1-year limitations period

Opinion of the Court
in which to seek modification does not indicate a congressional intent to
limit other parts of $ 22. Nor is there any evidence that when Congress
reenacted the phrase "change in conditions" as late as 1984, it was endorsing prior Court of Appeals' decisions limiting the phrase to changes
in physical conditions. In addition, the dicta in those cases that Rambo
claims is swept away by the Court's reading of $ 22 is neither authoritative nor persuasive. Finally, experience in the 11 years since Fleetwood does not suggest that the Office of Workers Compensation Programs (OWCP) and courts will be flooded with litigation arising from
modification requests based on every change in an employee's wages.
Such an argument is better directed at Congress or the OWCP Director
than at the courts; and it is based on a misconception of the LHWCA
and the instant holding, for a change in wage-earning capacity will occur
with a change in actual wages only when those wages fairly and reasonably represent such capacity. Pp. 298-303.

"on the ground of a change in conditions or because of a mis-take in a determination of fact." The question in this case

is whether a party may seek modification on the ground of"change in conditions" when there has been no change in the
employee's physical condition but rather an increase in theemployee's wage-earning capacity due to the acquisition of
new skills. I

In 1980, respondent John Rambo injured his back and legwhile working as a longshore frontman for petitioner Metropolitan Stevedore Company. Rambo filed a claim with theDepartment of Labor that was submitted to an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ). After Rambo and petitioner stipu-lated that Rambo sustained a 22

1/2% permanent partial disability and a corresponding $120.24 decrease in his $534.38weekly wage, the ALJ, pursuant to LHWCA $ 8(c)(21),

awarded Rambo 662/3% of that figure, or $80.16 per week.App. 5. Because the ALJ also found that Rambo's disability
was not due solely to his work-related injury and was "mate-rially and substantially greater than that which would have
resulted from the subsequent injury alone," LHWCA$ 8(f )(1), 33 U. S. C. $ 908(f )(1), he limited the period of petitioner's liability to pay compensation to 104 weeks. Ibid.;App. 6. Later payments were to issue from the special fund
administered by respondent Director of the Office of Work-ers' Compensation Programs (OWCP), LHWCA $ 8(f)(2),
33 U. S. C. $ 908(f)(2). Employers (or their insurance carri-ers) contribute to the fund based on their outstanding liabilities. See LHWCA $ 44(c)(2)(B), 33 U. S. C. $ 944(c)(2)(B).After the award, Rambo began attending crane school.
With the new skills so acquired, he obtained longshore workas a crane operator. He also worked in his spare time as a
heavy lift truck operator. Between 1985 and 1990, Rambo'saverage weekly wages ranged between $1,307.81 and
$1,690.50, more than three times his preinjury earnings,though his physical condition remained unchanged. In light

of the increased wage-earning capacity, petitioner, whichmay seek modification even when the special fund has assumed responsibility for payments, see LHWCA $ 22, 33U. S. C. $ 922; 20 CFR $ 702.148(b) (1994), filed an application
to modify the disability award under LHWCA $ 22. Peti-tioner asserted there had been a "change in conditions" so
that Rambo was no longer "disabled" under the Act. TheALJ agreed that an award may be modified based on changes
in the employee's wage-earning capacity, even absent achange in physical condition. After discounting wage increases due to inflation and considering Rambo's risk of jobloss and other employment prospects, the ALJ concluded
Rambo "no longer has a wage-earning capacity loss" and ter-minated his disability payments. App. 68. The Benefits
Review Board affirmed, relying on Fleetwood v. NewportNews Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co., 16 BRBS 282 (1984),
aff 'd, 776 F. 2d 1225 (CA4 1985), which held that "change incondition[s]" means change in wage-earning capacity, as well
as change in physical condition. App. 73. A panel of theCourt of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed.

Rambo v.Director, OWCP, 28 F. 3d 86 (1994). Rejecting the Fourth

Circuit's approach in Fleetwood, the Ninth Circuit held thatLHWCA $ 22 authorizes modification of an award only where
there has been a change in the claimant's physical condition.We granted certiorari to resolve this split, 513 U. S. 1106
(1995), and now reverse. II

The LHWCA is a comprehensive scheme to provide com-pensation "in respect of disability or death of an employee
. . . if the disability or death results from an injury occurringupon the navigable waters of the United States." LHWCA

$ 3, 33 U. S. C. $ 903(a). Section 22 of the Act provides formodification of awards "on the ground of a change in conditions or because of a mistake in a determination of fact." 33U. S. C. $ 922. In Rambo's view and that of the Ninth Circuit, "change in conditions" means change in physical condi515us1$72l 08-25-98 19:20:20 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
tion and does not include changes in other conditions rele-vant to the initial entitlement to benefits, such as a change

in wage-earning capacity. In our view, this interpretationof "change in conditions" cannot stand in the face of the language, structure, and purpose of the Act.

A
Neither Rambo nor the Ninth Circuit has attempted tobase their position on the language of the statute, where

analysis in a statutory construction case ought to begin, for"when a statute speaks with clarity to an issue judicial inquiry into the statute's meaning, in all but the most extraor-dinary circumstance, is finished." Estate of Cowart v.
Nicklos Drilling Co., 505 U. S. 469, 475 (1992); Demarest v.Manspeaker, 498 U. S. 184, 190 (1991).

Section 22 of the Act provides the only way to modify anaward once it has issued. The section states:

"Upon his own initiative, or upon the application ofany party in interest (including an employer or carrier
which has been granted relief under section 908(f) of thistitle), on the ground of a change in conditions or because
of a mistake in a determination of fact by the deputycommissioner, the deputy commissioner may, at any
time prior to one year after the date of the last paymentof compensation, . . . or at any time prior to one year
after the rejection of a claim, review a compensationcase . . . and . . . issue a new compensation order which
may terminate, continue, reinstate, increase, or de-crease such compensation, or award compensation." 33
U. S. C. $ 922.
On two occasions we have construed the phrase "mistakein a determination of fact" and observed that nothing in the

statutory language supports attempts to limit it to particularkinds of factual errors or to cases involving new evidence
or changed circumstances. See O'Keeffe v. Aerojet-General

Opinion of the Court
Shipyards, Inc., 404 U. S. 254, 255-256 (1971) (per curiam);
Banks v. Chicago Grain Trimmers Assn., Inc., 390 U. S. 459,
465 (1968). The language of $ 22 also provides no supportfor Rambo's narrow construction of the phrase "change in

conditions." The use of "conditions," a word in the plural,
suggests that Congress did not intend to limit the bases formodifying awards to a single condition, such as an employee's

physical health. See 2A N. Singer, Sutherland on StatutoryConstruction $ 47.34, p. 274 (5th rev. ed. 1992) (" `Ordinarily
the legislature by use of a plural term intends a reference tomore than one matter or thing' ") (quoting N. Y. Statutes
Law $ 252 (McKinney 1971)); cf. 1 U. S. C. $ 1 ("[W]ords importing the plural include the singular"). Rather, under the
"normal" or "natural reading," Estate of Cowart, supra, at
477, the applicable "conditions" are those that entitled the
employee to benefits in the first place, the same conditions
on which continuing entitlement is predicated.

Our interpretation is confirmed by the language of
LHWCA $$ 2(10) and 8(c)(21). Section 2(10) defines "[d]isability" as "incapacity because of injury to earn the wages
which the employee was receiving at the time of injury in
the same or any other employment." 33 U. S. C. $ 902(10).
For certain injuries the statute creates a conclusive presumption of incapacity to earn wages and sets compensation
at 662/3% of the claimant's actual wage for a fixed number
of weeks, according to a statutory schedule. See LHWCA

$$ 8(c)(1)-(20), (22), 33 U. S. C. $$ 908(c)(1)-20, (22). When
these types of scheduled injuries occur, a claimant simply
proves the relevant physical injury and compensation follows
for a finite period of time. See Bath Iron Works Corp. v.
Director, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs, 506
U. S. 153, 156, n. 4 (1993); Potomac Elec. Power Co. v. Director, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs, 449 U. S.
268, 269 (1980). "In all other cases," however, the statute
provides "the compensation shall be 662/3 per centum of the
difference between the average weekly wages of the em515us1$72l 08-25-98 19:20:20 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
ployee and the employee's wage-earning capacity thereafterin the same employment or otherwise, payable during the

continuance of partial disability." LHWCA $ 8(c)(21), 33U. S. C. $ 908(c)(21). For these nonscheduled injuries, the
type at issue in this case, loss of wage-earning capacity is
an element of the claimant's case, for without the statutorypresumption that accompanies scheduled injuries, a claimant

is not "disabled" unless he proves "incapacity because ofinjury to earn the wages." LHWCA $ 2(10), 33 U. S. C.

$ 902(10). See Bath Iron Works, supra, at 156; Potomac
Elec. Power Co., supra, at 269-270. These two sections
make it clear that compensation, as an initial matter, is predicated on loss of wage-earning capacity, and that such compensation should continue only "during the continuance of
partial disability," LHWCA $ 8(c)(21), 33 U. S. C. $ 908(c)(21),
i. e., during the continuance of the "incapacity . . . to earn
the wages," LHWCA $ 2(10), 33 U. S. C. $ 902(10). Section
22 accommodates this statutory requirement by providing
for modification of an award on the ground of "a change in
conditions." 33 U. S. C. $ 922.

Rambo's insistence on what seems to us a " `narrowly technical and impractical construction' " of this phrase, O'Keeffe,
supra, at 255 (quoting Luckenbach S. S. Co. v. Norton, 106
F. 2d 137, 138 (CA3 1939)), does more than disregard the
plain language of $$ 22, 2(10), and 8(c)(21). It also is inconsistent with the structure and purpose of the LHWCA.
Like most other workers' compensation schemes, the
LHWCA does not compensate physical injury alone but the
disability produced by that injury. See LHWCA $$ 3(a), 8,
33 U. S. C. $$ 903(a), 908; see also 1C A. Larson, Law of
Workmen's Compensation $ 57.11 (1994). Disability under
the LHWCA, defined in terms of wage-earning capacity,
LHWCA $ 2(10), is in essence an economic, not a medical,
concept. Cf. 3 Larson, supra, $ 81.31(e), p. 15-1150 (1995)
("[D]isability in the compensation sense has an economic as
well as a medical component"). It may be ascertained for

298 METROPOLITAN STEVEDORE CO. v. RAMBO

Opinion of the Court
nonscheduled injuries according to the employee's actual
earnings, if they "fairly and reasonably represent his wageearning capacity," and if they do not, then with "due regard
to the nature of [the employee's] injury, the degree of physical impairment, his usual employment and any other factors
or circumstances in the case which may affect his capacity to
earn wages in his disabled condition, including the effect of
disability as it may naturally extend into the future."
LHWCA $ 8(h), 33 U. S. C. $ 908(h). The fundamental purpose of the Act is to compensate employees (or their beneficiaries) for wage-earning capacity lost because of injury;
where that wage-earning capacity has been reduced, restored, or improved, the basis for compensation changes and
the statutory scheme allows for modification.

B
Given that the language of $ 22 and the structure of the
Act itself leave little doubt as to Congress' intent, any argument based on legislative history is of minimal, if any, relevance. See Connecticut Nat. Bank v. Germain, 503 U. S.
249, 254, (1992); Ardestani v. INS, 502 U. S. 129, 136 (1991);
cf. Intercounty Constr. Corp. v. Walter, 422 U. S. 1, 8 (1975)
(construing ambiguity in application of $ 22's 1-year limitations period). In any event, we find Rambo's arguments
that the legislative history provides support for his view
lacking in force.

From congressional Reports accompanying amendments
to $ 22 in 1934, 1938, and 1984, Reports suggesting Congress
was unwilling to extend the 1-year limitations period in
which a party may seek modification, Rambo would have us
infer that Congress intended a narrow construction of other
parts of $ 22, including the circumstances that would justify
reopening an award. We rejected this very argument in
Banks, supra, at 465, and its logic continues to elude us.
Congress' decision to maintain a 1-year limitations period

299Cite as: 515 U. S. 291 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
has no apparent relevance to which changed conditions mayjustify modifying an award.

Rambo next contends that following McCormick S. S. Co.v.

United States Employees' Compensation Comm'n, 64
F. 2d 84 (CA9 1933), the Courts of Appeals unanimously held
that "change in conditions" refers only to changes in physicalconditions, so Congress' reenactment of the phrase "change

in conditions" when it amended other parts of $ 22 as late as1984 must be understood to endorse that approach. We
have often relied on Congress' "reenact[ment of] statutorylanguage that has been given a consistent judicial construction," Central Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate Bank
of Denver, N. A., 511 U. S. 164, 185 (1994); see Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U. S. 552, 566-567 (1988), in particular where
Congress was aware of or made reference to that judicial
construction, see Brown v. Gardner, 513 U. S. 115, 121 (1994);
United States v. Calamaro, 354 U. S. 351, 359 (1957). The
cases in the relevant period, however, were based on a misreading of McCormick, supra, which did not reject the idea
that $ 22 included a change in wage-earning capacity, but
merely expressed doubt that $ 22 "applies to a change in
earnings due to economic conditions," 64 F. 2d, at 85; they
involved dicta, not holdings, see, e. g., Pillsbury v. Alaska
Packers Assn., 85 F. 2d 758, 760 (CA9 1936), rev'd on other
grounds, 301 U. S. 174 (1937); Burley Welding Works, Inc. v.
Lawson, 141 F. 2d 964, 966 (CA5 1944); General Dynamics
Corp. v. Director, OWCP, 673 F. 2d 23, 25, n. 6 (CA1 1982)
(per curiam); and they were not uniform in their approach,
see, e. g., Hole v. Miami Shipyards Corp., 640 F. 2d 769, 772
(CA5 1981) ("[T]he compensation award may be modified
years later to reflect . . . greater or lesser economic injury").
Under these circumstances, we are not persuaded that congressional silence in the reenactment of the phrase "change
in conditions" carries any significance.

In a related argument, Rambo criticizes petitioner's reading of $ 22 because it sweeps away an accumulation of more

515us1$72l 08-25-98 19:20:20 PAGES OPINPGT
300 METROPOLITAN STEVEDORE CO. v. RAMBO

Opinion of the Court
than 50 years of dicta. Far from counseling hesitation, how-ever, we think this step long overdue. "[A]ge is no antidote

to clear inconsistency with a statute," Brown v. Gardner,
supra, at 122, and the dictum of Pillsbury and Burley Welding Works has not even aged with integrity, see, e. g., Fleetwood v. Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Co., 16BRBS 282 (1984);

LaFaille v. Benefits Review Board, U. S.
Dept. of Labor, 884 F. 2d 54, 62 (CA2 1989); Avondale Shipyards, Inc. v. Guidry, 967 F. 2d 1039, 1042, n. 6 (CA5 1992)
(dictum). Breath spent repeating dicta does not infuse itwith life. The unnecessary observations of these Courts of

Appeals "are neither authoritative nor persuasive." McLaren v. Fleischer, 256 U. S. 477, 482 (1921); cf. United States
v. Estate of Donnelly, 397 U. S. 286, 295 (1970).

Finally, Rambo argues that including a change in wageearning capacity as a change in conditions under $ 22 will
flood the OWCP and the courts with litigation because
parties will request modification every time an employee's
wages change or the economy takes a turn in one direction
or the other. Experience in the 11 years since the Benefits
Review Board decided Fleetwood, supra, suggests otherwise, but that argument is, in any case, better directed at
Congress or the Director in her rulemaking capacity, see
LHWCA $ 39(a), 33 U. S. C. $ 939(a); Director, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs v. Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co., 514 U. S. 122, 134 (1995), than at the
courts. It is also based on a misconception of the LHWCA
and our holding today. We recognize only that an award in
a nonscheduled-injury case may be modified where there has
been a change in wage-earning capacity. A change in actual
wages is controlling only when actual wages "fairly and reasonably represent . . . wage-earning capacity." LHWCA

$ 8(h), 33 U. S. C $ 908(h). Otherwise, wage-earning capacity
may be determined according to the many factors identified
in $ 8(h), including "any . . . factors or circumstances in the
case which may affect [the employee's] capacity to earn

wages in his disabled condition, including the effect ofdisability as it may naturally extend into the future." This

circumspect approach does not permit a change in wage-earning capacity with every variation in actual wages or
transient change in the economy. There may be cases rais-ing difficult questions as to what constitutes a change in
wage-earning capacity, but we need not address them here.Rambo acquired additional, marketable skills and the ALJ,
recognizing that higher wages do not necessarily prove anincrease in wage-earning capacity, took care to account for
inflation and risk of job loss in evaluating Rambo's new"wage-earning capacity in an open labor market under normal employment conditions." App. 66.We hold that a disability award may be modified under

$ 22 where there is a change in the employee's wage-earningcapacity, even without any change in the employee's physical
condition. Because Rambo raised other arguments beforethe Ninth Circuit that the panel did not have the opportunity
to address, we reverse and remand for proceedings consist-ent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.
Justice Stevens, dissenting.
The statutory provision that the Court construes todaywas enacted in 1927. Although one 1985 case reached the

result the Court adopts today, Fleetwood v. Newport News
Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co., 776 F. 2d 1225 (CA4), over 60years of otherwise consistent precedent accords with respondents' interpretation of the Act. For the reasons statedby Judge Warriner in his dissent in Fleetwood, I would not
change this settled view of the law without an appropri-ate directive from Congress. Judge Warriner correctly
observed:

"Beginning with the first opinion dealing with thequestion, handed down in 1933, and continuing without

wavering thereafter, the courts have uniformly inter515us1$72i 08-25-98 19:20:20 PAGES OPINPGT
302 METROPOLITAN STEVEDORE CO. v. RAMBO

Stevens, J., dissenting
preted the term `change in conditions' in Section 22 ofthe Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation

Act (LHWCA), 33 U. S. C. $ 922 (1982), to refer exclu-sively to a change in the physical condition of the employee receiving compensation. This also was `the
meaning generally attributed to similar phraseology instate workman's compensation acts' in existence before

or shortly after the enactment of the LHWCA in 1927.
See Atlantic Coast Shipping Co. v. Golubiewski, 9
F. Supp. 315, 317 (D. Md. 1934)."The majority's nice effort to distinguish this prior

case law serves only to highlight the numerous and varied factual situations in which the federal courts have
withstood temptation and have strictly adhered to this
interpretation. In McCormick Steamship Co. v. United
States Employees' Compensation Commission, 64 F. 2d
84 (9th Cir. 1933), for example, the Court refused to
allow the modification of a compensation order under
Section 22 where the employee's earnings were diminished as a result of deteriorating economic conditions.
Id., at 85. Conversely, the fact that an employee received higher wages because of better economic conditions in the 1940's was held not to constitute a `change
in conditions' so as to allow a reduction in the employee's
compensation award. Burley Welding Works v. Lawson, 141 F. 2d 964, 966 (5th Cir. 1944). The courts have
refused to find a `change in conditions' where the employee was imprisoned in a penitentiary for life, Atlantic
Coast Shipping Co. v. Golubiewski, 9 F. Supp. at 316-19,
or where the employee was committed to an insane asylum. Bay Ridge Operating Co. v. Lowe, 14 F. Supp. 280,
280-82 (S. D. N. Y. 1936).

"In every one of these cases, decided soon after the
effective date of the Act, the respective courts explicitly
stated and held that the term `change in conditions' in
Section 22 refers to the physical condition of the em515us1$72i 08-25-98 19:20:20 PAGES OPINPGT

303Cite as: 515 U. S. 291 (1995)
Stevens, J., dissenting
ployee receiving compensation. In a more recent case,General Dynamics, Inc. v. Director, Office of Workers'

Compensation Programs, 673 F. 2d 23 (1st Cir. 1982),the court reiterated this interpretation: `[c]ourts uniformly have held a "change in conditions" means achange in the employee's

physical condition, not otherconditions.' Id., at 25[, n. 6] (citing Burley Welding

Works, Inc. v. Lawson, 141 F. 2d at 966)."Despite fifty years, and more, of precedent, the majority has overturned this established construction ofthe term `change in conditions' and has revised it to have
it apply to changes in economic conditions occurring dur-ing the term of compensation. Such a departure from
settled prior case law is not warranted absent any indi-cation from the Congress that such a change in the statute is what is desired by the lawmakers. Congress, itshould not be necessary to add, indicates its desires by
adopting legislation.. . . . .

"Fifty years is a long time. And perhaps it can beargued that the Board's, and the courts', and the Congress' erstwhile interpretation of the phrase was inhu-mane, or unenlightened, or an anachronism, or something else even more disparaging. But it cannot beargued, I submit, that the prior interpretation was
not and is not the law." Id., at 1235-1236 (footnotesomitted).

For those reasons, I would affirm the judgment of theCourt of Appeals. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.

Syllabus

JOHNSON et al. v. JONES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe seventh circuit

No. 94-455. Argued April 18, 1995--Decided June 12, 1995
Respondent Jones brought this "constitutional tort" action under 42

U. S. C. $ 1983 against five named policemen, claiming that they used
excessive force when they arrested him and that they beat him at the
police station. As government officials, the officers were entitled to
assert a qualified immunity defense. Three of them (the petitioners
here) moved for summary judgment arguing that, whatever evidence
Jones might have about the other two officers, he could point to no evidence that these three had beaten him or had been present during beatings. Holding that there was sufficient circumstantial evidence supporting Jones' theory of the case, the District Court denied the motion.
Petitioners sought an immediate appeal, arguing that the denial was
wrong because the evidence in the pretrial record was not sufficient to
show a "genuine" issue of fact for trial, Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56(c). The
Seventh Circuit held that it lacked appellate jurisdiction over this contention and dismissed the appeal.

Held: A defendant, entitled to invoke a qualified immunity defense, may

not appeal a district court's summary judgment order insofar as that
order determines whether or not the pretrial record sets forth a "genuine" issue of fact for trial. Pp. 309-320.

(a) Three background principles guide the Court. First, 28 U. S. C.

$ 1291 grants appellate courts jurisdiction to hear appeals only from district courts' "final decisions." Second, under Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U. S. 541, and subsequent decisions, a so-called
"collateral order" amounts to an immediately appealable "final decisio[n]" under $ 1291, even though the district court may have entered it
long before the case has ended, if the order (1) conclusively determines
the disputed question, (2) resolves an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action, and (3) will be effectively unreviewable on appeal from the final judgment. Third, in Mitchell v. Forsyth,
472 U. S. 511, 528, this Court held that a district court's order denying
a defendant's summary judgment motion was an immediately appealable
"collateral order" (i. e., a "final decision") under Cohen, where (1) the
defendant was a public official asserting a qualified immunity defense,

Syllabus
and (2) the issue appealed concerned, not which facts the parties might
be able to prove, but, rather, whether or not certain given facts show a
violation of "clearly established" law. Pp. 309-312.

(b) Orders of the kind here at issue are not appealable for three reasons. First, considered purely as precedent, Mitchell itself does not
support appealability because the underlying dispute therein involved
the application of "clearly established" law to a given (for appellate purposes undisputed) set of facts, and the Court explicitly limited its holding to appeals challenging, not a district court's determination about
what factual issues are "genuine," but the purely legal issue what law
was "clearly established." Second, although Cohen's conceptual theory
of appealability finds a "final" district court decision in part because the
immediately appealable decision involves issues significantly different
from those that underlie the plaintiff's basic case, it will often prove
difficult to find any such "separate" question where a defendant simply
wants to appeal a district court's determination that the evidence is
sufficient to permit a particular finding of fact after trial. Finally, the
competing considerations underlying questions of finality--the inconvenience and costs of piecemeal review, the danger of denying justice
by delay, the comparative expertise of trial and appellate courts, and
the wise use of appellate resources--argue against extending Mitchell
to encompass orders of the kind at issue and in favor of limiting interlocutory appeals of "qualified immunity" matters to cases presenting more
abstract issues of law. Pp. 313-318.

(c) Neither of petitioners' arguments as to why the Court's effort to
separate reviewable from unreviewable summary judgment determinations will prove unworkable--that the parties can easily manipulate the
Court's holding and that appellate courts will have great difficulty in
accomplishing such separation--presents a problem serious enough to
require a different conclusion. Pp. 318-319.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case concerns government officials--entitled to asserta qualified immunity defense in a "constitutional tort" action--who seek an immediate appeal of a district court orderdenying their motions for summary judgment. The order in
question resolved a fact-related dispute about the pretrialrecord, namely, whether or not the evidence in the pretrial
record was sufficient to show a genuine issue of fact for trial.We hold that the defendants cannot immediately appeal this
kind of fact-related district court determination. And, weaffirm the similar holding of the Court of Appeals for the
Seventh Circuit. I

The plaintiff in this case, Houston Jones, is a diabetic.Police officers found him on the street while he was having
an insulin seizure. The officers thought he was drunk, theyarrested him, and they took him to the police station.
Jones later found himself in a hospital, with several brokenribs. Subsequently, Jones brought this "constitutional tort"
action against five named policemen. Rev. Stat. $ 1979, asamended, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983. Jones claimed that these policemen used excessive force when they arrested him and thatthey beat him at the station.

Three of the officers (the petitioners here) moved for sum-mary judgment arguing that, whatever evidence Jones might
have about the other two officers, he could point to no evi-dence that these three had beaten him or had been present
while others did so. Jones responded by pointing to hisdeposition, in which he swore that officers (though he did not
name them) had used excessive force when arresting himand, later, in the booking room at the station house. He also
pointed to the three officers' own depositions, in which they

Opinion of the Court
admitted they were present at the arrest and in or near the
booking room when Jones was there.

The District Court denied the officers' summary judgment
motion. The court wrote that Seventh Circuit precedent indicated potential liability if the three officers "stood by and
allowed others to beat the plaintiff." App. to Pet. for Cert.
7a. And, the court held that there was "sufficient circumstantial evidence supporting [Jones'] theory of the case."
Id., at 8a.

The three officers immediately appealed the District
Court's denial of their summary judgment motion. They argued, in relevant part, that the denial was wrong because
the record contained "not a scintilla of evidence . . . that one
or more" of them had "ever struck, punched or kicked the
plaintiff, or ever observed anyone doing so." Brief for Appellants in No. 93-3777 (CA7), p. 10. But, the Seventh Circuit refused to consider this argument--namely, that the District Court had improperly rejected their contention that the
record lacked sufficient evidence even to raise a "genuine"
(i. e., triable) issue of fact. The Seventh Circuit held that it
"lack[ed] appellate jurisdiction over th[is] contention," i. e.,
of the "evidence insufficiency" contention that "we didn't do
it." 26 F. 3d 727, 728 (1994). It consequently dismissed
their appeal.

Courts of Appeals hold different views about the immediate appealability of such pretrial "evidence insufficiency"
claims made by public official defendants who assert qualified
immunity defenses. Compare, e. g., Kaminsky v. Rosenblum, 929 F. 2d 922, 926 (CA2 1991) (saying that no appellate
jurisdiction exists); Giuffre v. Bissell, 31 F. 3d 1241, 1247
(CA3 1994) (same); Boulos v. Wilson, 834 F. 2d 504, 509 (CA5
1987) (same); Elliott v. Thomas, 937 F. 2d 338, 341-342 (CA7
1991) (same), cert. denied, 502 U. S. 1074, 1121 (1992);
Crawford-El v. Britton, 951 F. 2d 1314, 1317 (CADC 1991)

1988) (saying that appellate jurisdiction does exist); Turnerv. Dammon, 848 F. 2d 440, 444 (CA4 1988) (same); Kelly v.

Bender, 23 F. 3d 1328, 1330 (CA8 1994) (same); Burgess v.Pierce County, 918 F. 2d 104, 106, and n. 3 (CA9 1990) (per
curiam) (same); Austin v. Hamilton, 945 F. 2d 1155, 1157,1162-1163 (CA10 1991) (same). We therefore granted certiorari. 513 U. S. 1071 (1995).

II

A

Three background principles guide our effort to decide thisissue. First, the relevant statute grants appellate courts

jurisdiction to hear appeals only from "final decisions" ofdistrict courts. 28 U. S. C. $ 1291. Given this statute, interlocutory appeals--appeals before the end of district courtproceedings--are the exception, not the rule. The statute
recognizes that rules that permit too many interlocutory ap-peals can cause harm. An interlocutory appeal can make it
more difficult for trial judges to do their basic job--supervis-ing trial proceedings. It can threaten those proceedings
with delay, adding costs and diminishing coherence. It alsorisks additional, and unnecessary, appellate court work
either when it presents appellate courts with less developedrecords or when it brings them appeals that, had the trial
simply proceeded, would have turned out to be unnecessary.See

Richardson-Merrell Inc. v. Koller, 472 U. S. 424, 430(1985); Flanagan v. United States, 465 U. S. 259, 263-264

(1984); Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v. Risjord, 449 U. S. 368,374 (1981).

Of course, sometimes interlocutory appellate review hasimportant countervailing benefits. In certain cases, it may
avoid injustice by quickly correcting a trial court's error. Itcan simplify, or more appropriately direct, the future course
of litigation. And, it can thereby reduce the burdens offuture proceedings, perhaps freeing a party from those

310 JOHNSON v. JONES

Opinion of the Court
burdens entirely. Congress consequently has authorized,through other statutory provisions, immediate appeals (or

has empowered courts to authorize immediate appeals) incertain classes of cases--classes in which these countervailing benefits may well predominate. None of these special
"immediate appeal" statutes, however, is applicable here.See 28 U. S. C. $ 1292 (immediate appeal of,

e. g., orders
granting or denying injunctions; authority to "certify" cer-tain important legal questions); Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 54(b)

(authorizing district courts to "direct the entry of a finaljudgment as to one or more but fewer than all of the claims
or parties"); 28 U. S. C. $$ 1292(e), 2072(c) (1988 ed., Supp. V)(authorizing this Court to promulgate rules designating
certain kinds of orders as immediately appealable); cf. 28
U. S. C. $ 1651 (authorizing federal courts to "issue all writsnecessary or appropriate," including writs of mandamus).

Second, in Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337U. S. 541 (1949), this Court held that certain so-called collateral orders amount to "final decisions," immediately appeal-able under the here-relevant statute, 28 U. S. C. $ 1291, even
though the district court may have entered those orders be-fore (perhaps long before) the case has ended. These special
"collateral orders" were those that fell within

"that small class which finally determine claims of right
separable from, and collateral to, rights asserted in theaction, too important to be denied review and too independent of the cause itself to require that appellate consideration be deferred until the whole case is adjudi-cated."

Cohen, supra, at 546.

More recently, this Court has restated Cohen as requiring
that the order " `[1] conclusively determine the disputed
question, [2] resolve an important issue completely separate
from the merits of the action, and [3] be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.' " Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority v. Metcalf & Eddy, Inc., 506 U. S.

311Cite as: 515 U. S. 304 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
139, 144 (1993) (brackets in original) (quoting Coopers &
Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U. S. 463, 468 (1978)).

In determining which "collateral orders" amount to "finaldecisions," these requirements help qualify for immediate

appeal classes of orders in which the considerations that
favor immediate appeals seem comparatively strong andthose that disfavor such appeals seem comparatively weak.

The requirement that the issue underlying the order be " `ef-fectively unreviewable' " later on, for example, means that
failure to review immediately may well cause significantharm. See 15A C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal
Practice and Procedure $ 3911, pp. 334-335 (1992) (hereinafter Wright & Miller). The requirement that the district
court's order "conclusively determine" the question means
that appellate review is likely needed to avoid that harm.
Id., at 333. The requirement that the matter be separate
from the merits of the action itself means that review now
is less likely to force the appellate court to consider approximately the same (or a very similar) matter more than once,
and also seems less likely to delay trial court proceedings
(for, if the matter is truly collateral, those proceedings might
continue while the appeal is pending). Id., at 333-334.

Third, in Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U. S. 511 (1985), this
Court held that a district court's order denying a defendant's
motion for summary judgment was an immediately appealable "collateral order" (i. e., a "final decision") under Cohen,
where (1) the defendant was a public official asserting a defense of "qualified immunity," and (2) the issue appealed concerned, not which facts the parties might be able to prove,
but, rather, whether or not certain given facts showed a violation of "clearly established" law. 472 U. S., at 528; see
Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800, 818 (1982) (holding that
public officials are entitled to a "qualified immunity" from
"liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not
violate clearly established . . . rights of which a reasonable
person would have known"). Applying Cohen's criteria, the

312 JOHNSON v. JONES

Opinion of the Court
Mitchell Court held that this kind of summary judgmentorder was, in a sense, "effectively unreviewable," for review

after trial would come too late to vindicate one importantpurpose of "qualified immunity"--namely, protecting public
officials, not simply from liability, but also from standingtrial.

Mitchell, supra, at 525-527. For related reasons, theCourt found that the order was conclusive, i. e., it "conclusively" settled the question of the defendant's immunity fromsuit. 472 U. S., at 527.

The Court in Mitchell found more difficult the "separabil-ity" question, i. e., whether or not the "qualified immunity"
issue was "completely separate from the merits of the ac-tion,"

supra, at 310. The Court concluded that:

"it follows from the recognition that qualified immunityis in part an entitlement not to be forced to litigate the

consequences of official conduct that a claim of immunityis

conceptually distinct from the merits of the plaintiff 'sclaim that his rights have been violated." Mitchell,

supra, at 527-528 (emphasis added).
And, the Court said that this "conceptual distinctness" madethe immediately appealable issue "separate" from the merits

of the plaintiff 's claim, in part because an

"appellate court reviewing the denial of the defendant'sclaim of immunity need not consider the correctness of

the plaintiff 's version of the facts, nor even determinewhether the plaintiff 's allegations actually state a claim.
All it need determine is a question of law: whether thelegal norms allegedly violated by the defendant were
clearly established at the time of the challenged actionsor, in cases where the district court has denied summary
judgment for the defendant on the ground that evenunder the defendant's version of the facts the defendant's conduct violated clearly established law, whetherthe law clearly proscribed the actions the defendant
claims he took." Id., at 528 (footnote omitted).

Opinion of the Court

B
We now consider the appealability of a portion of a districtcourt's summary judgment order that, though entered in a

"qualified immunity" case, determines only a question of "ev-idence sufficiency,"

i. e., which facts a party may, or may not,be able to prove at trial. This kind of order, we conclude,

is not appealable. That is, the District Court's determina-tion that the summary judgment record in this case raised a
genuine issue of fact concerning petitioners' involvement inthe alleged beating of respondent was not a "final decision"
within the meaning of the relevant statute. We so decideessentially for three reasons.

First, consider Mitchell itself, purely as precedent. Thedispute underlying the

Mitchell appeal involved the applica-tion of "clearly established" law to a given (for appellate purposes undisputed) set of facts. And, the Court, in its opin-ion, explicitly limited its holding to appeals challenging, not
a district court's determination about what factual issues are"genuine," Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56(c), but the purely legal
issue what law was "clearly established." The opinion, forexample, referred specifically to a district court's "denial of
a claim of qualified immunity, to the extent that it turns on
an issue of law." 472 U. S., at 530 (emphasis added). It"emphasize[d] . . . that the appealable issue is a purely legal

one: whether the facts alleged (by the plaintiff, or, in somecases, the defendant) support a claim of violation of clearly
established law." Id., at 528, n. 9. It distinguished prece-dent not permitting interlocutory appeals on the ground that

"a qualified immunity ruling . . . is . . . a legal issue that canbe decided with reference only to undisputed facts and in
isolation from the remaining issues of the case." Id., at 530,n. 10. And, it explained its separability holding by saying
that "[a]n appellate court reviewing the denial of the defend-ant's claim of immunity need not consider the correctness of
the plaintiff 's version of the facts." Id., at 528. Althoughthere is some language in the opinion that sounds as if it

515us1$73q 08-11-98 20:39:31 PAGES OPINPGT
314 JOHNSON v. JONES

Opinion of the Court
might imply the contrary, it does not do so when readin context. See,

e. g., id., at 526 (referring to defendant's
entitlement to summary judgment, not to appealability, bysaying that "defendant is entitled to summary judgment if

discovery fails to uncover evidence sufficient to create a genuine issue").Second, consider, in the context of an "evidence sufficiency" claim, Cohen's conceptual theory of appealability--the theory that brings immediate appealability within the
scope of the jurisdictional statute's "final decision" require-ment. That theory finds a "final" district court decision in
part because the immediately appealable decision involves
issues significantly different from those that underlie the
plaintiff 's basic case. As we have just pointed out, Mitchell
rested upon the view that "a claim of immunity is conceptually distinct from the merits of the plaintiff 's claim." 472
U. S., at 527. It held that this was so because, although
sometimes practically intertwined with the merits, a claim of
immunity nonetheless raises a question that is significantly
different from the questions underlying plaintiff 's claim on
the merits (i. e., in the absence of qualified immunity). Id.,
at 528.

Where, however, a defendant simply wants to appeal a district court's determination that the evidence is sufficient to
permit a particular finding of fact after trial, it will often
prove difficult to find any such "separate" question--one that
is significantly different from the fact-related legal issues
that likely underlie the plaintiff 's claim on the merits. See
Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U. S. 242, 248 (1986)
(district court's task, in deciding whether there is a "genuine" issue of fact, is to determine "if the evidence is such that
a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving
party"); see also Elliott v. Thomas, 937 F. 2d, at 341
("[W]hether the defendants did the deeds alleged . . . is precisely the question for trial") (emphasis in original), cert. denied, 502 U. S. 1074, 1121 (1992); Wright v. South Arkansas

315Cite as: 515 U. S. 304 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
Regional Health Center, Inc., 800 F. 2d 199, 203 (CA8 1986)(saying that this question "is . . . less clearly separable from

the merits" than the question in Mitchell); see also Brieffor United States 18 ("In one sense, a ruling regarding the
sufficiency of the evidence is closely intertwined with the
merits").It has been suggested that

Mitchell implicitly recognized
that "the need to protect officials against the burdens offurther pretrial proceedings and trial" justifies a relaxation

of the separability requirement. 15A Wright & Miller$ 3914.10, at 656; see

id., $ 3911, at 344-345; id., $ 3911.2, at
387; see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 20 ("[W]here the right not to
be tried is at stake, [closer] association with the merits is
tolerated") (argument of the United States). Assuming that
to be so, and despite a similar interest in avoiding trial in
the kind of case here at issue, we can find no separability.
To take what petitioners call a small step beyond Mitchell,
Brief for Petitioners 18, would more than relax the separability requirement--it would in many cases simply abandon it.

Finally, consider the competing considerations that underlie questions of finality. See supra, at 309-310. We of
course decide appealability for categories of orders rather
than individual orders. See Digital Equipment Corp. v.

Desktop Direct, Inc., 511 U. S. 863, 868 (1994). Thus, we do
not now in each individual case engage in ad hoc balancing
to decide issues of appealability. See generally P. Bator, D.
Meltzer, P. Mishkin, & D. Shapiro, Hart and Wechsler's The
Federal Courts and The Federal System 1810 (3d ed. 1988).
But, that does not mean that, in delineating appealable categories, we should not look to "the competing considerations
underlying all questions of finality--`the inconvenience and
costs of piecemeal review on the one hand and the danger of
denying justice by delay on the other.' " Eisen v. Carlisle &
Jacquelin, 417 U. S. 156, 171 (1974) (quoting Dickinson v.
Petroleum Conversion Corp., 338 U. S. 507, 511 (1950)).
And, those considerations, which we discussed above in Part

515us1$73q 08-11-98 20:39:31 PAGES OPINPGT
316 JOHNSON v. JONES

Opinion of the Court
II-A, argue against extending Mitchell to encompass ordersof the kind before us.

For one thing, the issue here at stake--the existence, ornonexistence, of a triable issue of fact--is the kind of issue
that trial judges, not appellate judges, confront almost daily.
Institutionally speaking, appellate judges enjoy no compara-tive expertise in such matters. Cf.

Pierce v. Underwood,
487 U. S. 552, 560-561 (1988); id., at 584 (White, J., concurringin part and dissenting in part) (noting that the "special expertise and experience of appellate courts" lies in "assessingthe relative force of . . . applications of legal norms") (internal quotation marks omitted). And, to that extent, interlocutory appeals are less likely to bring important errorcorrecting benefits here than where purely legal matters are
at issue, as in Mitchell. Cf. Richardson-Merrell, 472 U. S.,
at 434 (stating that the fact that "[m]ost pretrial orders [of
the kind there at issue] are ultimately affirmed by appellate
courts" militated against immediate appealability).

For another thing, questions about whether or not a record
demonstrates a "genuine" issue of fact for trial, if appealable,
can consume inordinate amounts of appellate time. Many
constitutional tort cases, unlike the simple "we didn't do it"
case before us, involve factual controversies about, for example, intent--controversies that, before trial, may seem nebulous. To resolve those controversies--to determine whether
there is or is not a triable issue of fact about such a matter--
may require reading a vast pretrial record, with numerous
conflicting affidavits, depositions, and other discovery materials. This fact means, compared with Mitchell, greater
delay.

For a third thing, the close connection between this kind
of issue and the factual matter that will likely surface at trial
means that the appellate court, in the many instances in
which it upholds a district court's decision denying summary
judgment, may well be faced with approximately the same
factual issue again, after trial, with just enough change

317Cite as: 515 U. S. 304 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
(brought about by the trial testimony) to require it, once
again, to canvass the record. That is to say, an interlocutory
appeal concerning this kind of issue in a sense makes unwise
use of appellate courts' time, by forcing them to decide in
the context of a less developed record, an issue very similar
to one they may well decide anyway later, on a record that
will permit a better decision. See 15A Wright & Miller

$ 3914.10, at 664 ("[I]f [immunity appeals] could be limited to
. . . issues of law . . . there would be less risk that the court
of appeals would need to waste time in duplicating investigations of the same facts on successive appeals").

The upshot is that, compared with Mitchell, considerations
of delay, comparative expertise of trial and appellate courts,
and wise use of appellate resources argue in favor of limiting
interlocutory appeals of "qualified immunity" matters to
cases presenting more abstract issues of law. Considering
these "competing considerations," we are persuaded that
"[i]mmunity appeals . . . interfere less with the final judgment rule if they [are] limited to cases presenting neat abstract issues of law." 15A Wright & Miller $ 3914.10, at 664;
cf. Puerto Rico Aqueduct, 506 U. S., at 147 (noting the argument for a distinction between fact-based and law-based appeals, but seeing no "basis for drawing" it with respect to
the particular kind of order at hand); 15A Wright & Miller

We recognize that, whether a district court's denial of summary judgment amounts to (a) a determination about preexisting "clearly established" law, or (b) a determination
about "genuine" issues of fact for trial, it still forces public
officials to trial. See Brief for Petitioners 11-16. And, to
that extent, it threatens to undercut the very policy (protecting public officials from lawsuits) that (the Mitchell Court
held) militates in favor of immediate appeals. Nonetheless,
the countervailing considerations that we have mentioned
(precedent, fidelity to statute, and underlying policies) are

Opinion of the Court
too strong to permit the extension of Mitchell to encompassappeals from orders of the sort before us.

C
We mention one final point. Petitioners argue that oureffort to separate reviewable from unreviewable summary

judgment determinations will prove unworkable. First,they say that the parties can easily manipulate our holding.
A defendant seeking to create a reviewable summary judg-ment order might do so simply by adding a reviewable claim
to a motion that otherwise would create an unreviewableorder. "[H]ere, for example," they say, "petitioners could
have contended that the law was unclear on how much forcemay be exerted against suspects who resist arrest." Brief
for Petitioners 29, n. 11.We do not think this is a serious problem. We concede
that, if the District Court in this case had determined thatbeating respondent violated clearly established law, petitioners could have sought review of that determination. But, itdoes not automatically follow that the Court of Appeals
would also have reviewed the here more important determi-nation that there was a genuine issue of fact as to whether
petitioners participated in (or were present at) a beating.Even assuming, for the sake of argument, that it may sometimes be appropriate to exercise "pendent appellate jurisdic-tion" over such a matter, but cf.

Swint v. Chambers CountyComm'n, 514 U. S. 35, 50-51 (1995), it seems unlikely that

courts of appeals would do so in a case where the appealableissue appears simply a means to lead the court to review the
underlying factual matter, see, e. g., Natale v. Ridgefield, 927F. 2d 101, 104 (CA2 1991) (saying exercise of pendent appellate jurisdiction is proper only in "exceptional circum-stances");

United States ex rel. Valders Stone & Marble, Inc.v. C-Way Constr. Co., 909 F. 2d 259, 262 (CA7 1990) (saying

exercise of such jurisdiction is proper only where there are" `compelling reasons' ").

319Cite as: 515 U. S. 304 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
Second, petitioners add, if appellate courts try to separatean appealed order's reviewable determination (that a given

set of facts violates clearly established law) from its unre-viewable determination (that an issue of fact is "genuine"),
they will have great difficulty doing so. District judges maysimply deny summary judgment motions without indicating
their reasons for doing so. How, in such a case, will thecourt of appeals know what set of facts to assume when it
answers the purely legal question about "clearly estab-lished" law?

This problem is more serious, but not serious enough tolead us to a different conclusion. When faced with an argument that the district court mistakenly identified clearly es-tablished law, the court of appeals can simply take, as given,
the facts that the district court assumed when it denied sum-mary judgment for that (purely legal) reason. Knowing
that this is "extremely helpful to a reviewing court," Ander-son, 477 U. S., at 250, n. 6, district courts presumably will
often state those facts. But, if they do not, we concede thata court of appeals may have to undertake a cumbersome review of the record to determine what facts the district court,in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, likely
assumed. Regardless, this circumstance does not make acritical difference to our result, for a rule that occasionally
requires a detailed evidence-based review of the record isstill, from a practical point of view, more manageable than
the rule that petitioners urge us to adopt. Petitioners' ap-proach would make that task, not the exception, but the rule.
We note, too, that our holding here has been the law inseveral Circuits for some time. See supra, at 308-309.
Yet, petitioners have not pointed to concrete examples of theunmanageability they fear.

III
For these reasons, we hold that a defendant, entitled toinvoke a qualified immunity defense, may not appeal a dis515us1$73q 08-11-98 20:39:31 PAGES OPINPGT

trict court's summary judgment order insofar as that orderdetermines whether or not the pretrial record sets forth a

COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE v.SCHLEIER

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fifth circuit

No. 94-500. Argued March 27, 1995--Decided June 14, 1995
On his 1986 federal income tax return, Erich Schleier (hereinafter respondent) included as gross income the backpay portion, but not the
liquidated damages portion, of an award that he received in settlement
of a claim under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967
(ADEA). After the Commissioner issued a deficiency notice, asserting
that the liquidated damages should have been included as income, respondent initiated Tax Court proceedings, contesting that ruling and
seeking a refund for the tax he had paid on his backpay. The Tax Court
agreed with respondent that the entire settlement constituted "damages
received . . . on account of personal injuries or sickness" within the
meaning of $ 104(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code and was therefore
excludable from gross income. The Court of Appeals affirmed.

Held: Recovery under the ADEA is not excludable from gross income. A

taxpayer must meet two independent requirements before a recovery
may be excluded under $ 104(a)(2): The underlying cause of action giving
rise to the recovery must be "based upon tort or tort type rights," and
the damages must have been received "on account of personal injuries
or sickness." Respondent has failed to satisfy either requirement.
Pp. 327-337.

(a) No part of respondent's settlement is excludable under $ 104(a)(2)'s
plain language. Recovery for back wages does not satisfy the critical
requirement of being "on account of" any personal injury, and no personal injury affected the amount of back wages recovered. In addition,
this Court explicitly held in Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston, 469
U. S. 111, 125, that Congress intended the ADEA's liquidated damages
to be punitive in nature; thus, they serve no compensatory function
and cannot be described as being "on account of personal injuries."
Pp. 327-332.

(b) There is also no basis for excluding respondent's recovery from
gross income under the Commissioner's regulation interpreting

$ 104(a)(2). Even if respondent were correct that this action is based
on "tort or tort type rights" within 26 CFR $ 1.104-1(c)'s meaning, this
requirement is not a substitute for the statutory requirement that the
amount be received "on account of personal injuries or sickness"; it is
an additional requirement. Pp. 333-334.

324 COMMISSIONER v. SCHLEIER

Opinion of the Court
(c) Nor is respondent's recovery based upon "tort or tort type rights"
as that term was construed in United States v. Burke, 504 U. S. 229,
where this Court rejected the argument that a taxpayer's backpay settlement under the pre-1991 Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964
should be excluded from gross income. Two elements that distinguish
the ADEA from the pre-1991 Title VII--namely, the ADEA rights to a
jury trial and liquidated damages--are insufficient to bring the ADEA
within Burke's conception of a "tort or tort type righ[t]," for the statute
lacks the primary characteristic of such an action: the availability of
compensatory damages. Moreover, satisfaction of Burke's "tort or tort
type" inquiry does not eliminate the need to satisfy the other requirement for excludability discussed herein. Pp. 334-336.

Opinion of the Court
gross income the amount received in settlement of a claim
for backpay and liquidated damages under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA).

I
Erich Schleier (respondent) 1 is a former employee of
United Airlines, Inc. (United). Pursuant to established policy, United fired respondent when he reached the age of 60.
Respondent then filed a complaint in Federal District Court
alleging that his termination violated the ADEA.

The ADEA "broadly prohibits arbitrary discrimination in
the workplace based on age." Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U. S.
575, 577 (1978); Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston, 469
U. S. 111, 120 (1985); see also McKennon v. Nashville Banner Publishing Co., 513 U. S. 352, 357 (1995). Subject to
certain defenses, see 29 U. S. C. $ 623(f ) (1988 ed. and Supp.
V), $$ 4 and 12 of the ADEA make it unlawful for an employer, inter alia, to discharge any individual between the
ages of 40 and 70 "because of such individual's age." 29
U. S. C. $$ 623(a)(1), 631(a). The ADEA incorporates many
of the enforcement and remedial mechanisms of the Fair
Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA). Like the FLSA, the
ADEA provides for "such legal or equitable relief as may be
appropriate to effectuate the purposes of this chapter." 29
U. S. C. $ 626(b). That relief may include "without limitation
judgments compelling employment, reinstatement or promotion." Ibid. More importantly for respondent's purposes,

the ADEA incorporates FLSA provisions that permit the
recovery "of wages lost and an additional equal amount as
liquidated damages." $ 216(b). See generally McKennon,
513 U. S., at 357.

1 Helen Schleier is also a respondent because she and her husband Erich
filed a joint return.

515us1$75I 08-13-98 12:36:57 PAGES OPINPGT
326 COMMISSIONER v. SCHLEIER

Opinion of the Court
Despite these broad remedial mechanisms, there are two
important constraints on courts' remedial power under the
ADEA. First, unlike the FLSA, the ADEA specifically provides that "liquidated damages shall be payable only in cases
of willful violations of this chapter." 29 U. S. C. $ 626(b); see
Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston, 469 U. S., at 125.
Second, the Courts of Appeals have unanimously held, and
respondent does not contest, that the ADEA does not permit
a separate recovery of compensatory damages for pain and
suffering or emotional distress.2

Respondent's ADEA complaint was consolidated with a
class action brought by other former United employees challenging United's policy. The ADEA claims were tried before a jury, which determined that United had committed a
willful violation of the ADEA. The District Court entered
judgment for the plaintiffs, but that judgment was reversed
on appeal. See Monroe v. United Air Lines, Inc., 736 F. 2d
394 (CA7 1984). The parties then entered into a settlement,
pursuant to which respondent received $145,629. Half of respondent's award was attributed to "backpay" and half to
"liquidated damages." United did not withhold any payroll
or income taxes from the portion of the settlement attributed
to liquidated damages.

Opinion of the Court
When respondent filed his 1986 federal income tax return,he included as gross income the backpay portion of the settlement, but excluded the portion attributed to liquidateddamages. The Commissioner issued a deficiency notice, asserting that respondent should have included the liquidateddamages as gross income. Respondent then initiated proceedings in the Tax Court, claiming that he had properlyexcluded the liquidated damages. Respondent also sought
a refund for the tax he had paid on the backpay portion ofthe settlement. The Tax Court agreed with respondent that
the entire settlement constituted "damages received . . . onaccount of personal injuries or sickness" within the meaning
of $ 104(a)(2) of the Tax Code and was therefore excludablefrom gross income. Relying on a prior Circuit decision that
had in turn relied on our decision in United States v. Burke,504 U. S. 229 (1992), the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed. Judgt. order reported at 26 F. 3d 1119 (1994).Because the Courts of Appeals have reached inconsistent
conclusions as to the taxability of ADEA recoveries in gen-eral and of the United settlement in particular, compare
Downey v. Commissioner, 33 F. 3d 836 (CA7 1994) (Unitedsettlement award is taxable), with

Schmitz v. Commissioner,34 F. 3d 790 (CA9 1994) (United settlement award is excludable), we granted certiorari, 513 U. S. 998 (1994). Our con-sideration of the plain language of $ 104(a), the text of the
regulation implementing $ 104(a)(2), and our reasoning in
Burke convince us that a recovery under the ADEA is notexcludable from gross income.

Section 61(a) of the Internal Revenue Code provides abroad definition of "gross income": "Except as otherwise provided in this subtitle, gross income means all income fromwhatever source derived." 26 U. S. C. $ 61(a). We have repeatedly emphasized the "sweeping scope" of this sectionand its statutory predecessors. Commissioner v. Glenshaw

331, 334 (1940). We have also emphasized the corollary to$ 61(a)'s broad construction, namely, the "default rule of statutory interpretation that exclusions from income must benarrowly construed."

United States v. Burke, 504 U. S., at248 (
Souter, J., concurring in judgment); see United Statesv.
Centennial Savings Bank FSB, 499 U. S. 573, 583-584(1991); Commissioner v. Jacobson, 336 U. S. 28, 49 (1949);

United States v. Burke, 504 U. S., at 244 (Scalia, J., concur-ring in judgment).

Respondent recognizes $ 61(a)'s "sweeping" definition andconcedes that his settlement constitutes gross income unless
it is expressly excepted by another provision in the TaxCode. Respondent claims, however, that his settlement
proceeds are excluded from $ 61(a)'s reach by 26 U. S. C.$ 104(a).

3 Section 104(a) provides an exclusion for five cate3 At the time of respondent's return, $ 104(a) provided in relevant part:
"Compensation for injuries or sickness
"(a) In general.--Except in the case of amounts attributable to (and not
in excess of) deductions allowed under section 213 (relating to medical,
etc., expenses) for any prior taxable year, gross income does not include--

"(1) amounts received under workmen's compensation acts as compensation for personal injuries or sickness;

"(2) the amount of any damages received (whether by suit or agreement
and whether as lump sums or as periodic payments) on account of personal
injuries or sickness;

"(3) amounts received through accident or health insurance for personal
injuries or sickness (other than amounts received by an employee, to the
extent such amounts (A) are attributable to contributions by the employer
which were not includible in the gross income of the employee, or (B) are
paid by the employer);

"(4) amounts received as a pension, annuity, or similar allowance for
personal injuries or sickness resulting from active service in the armed
forces of any country or in the Coast and Geodetic Survey or the Public
Health Service, or as a disability annuity payable under the provisions of
section 808 of the Foreign Service Act of 1980; and

"(5) amounts received by an individual as disability income attributable
to injuries incurred as a direct result of a violent attack which the Secre515us1$75I 08-13-98 12:36:58 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
gories of "compensation for personal injuries or sickness."Respondent argues that his settlement award falls within

the second of those categories, which excludes from grossincome "the amount of any damages received . . . on account
of personal injuries or sickness." $ 104(a)(2).

In our view, the plain language of the statute underminesrespondent's contention. Consideration of a typical recovery in a personal injury case illustrates the usual meaning of"on account of personal injuries." Assume that a taxpayer
is in an automobile accident, is injured, and as a result ofthat injury suffers (a) medical expenses, (b) lost wages, and
(c) pain, suffering, and emotional distress that cannot bemeasured with precision. If the taxpayer settles a resulting
lawsuit for $30,000 (and if the taxpayer has not previously
deducted her medical expenses, see $ 104(a)), the entire$30,000 would be excludable under $ 104(a)(2). The medical

expenses for injuries arising out of the accident clearly constitute damages received "on account of personal injuries."
Similarly, the portion of the settlement intended to compensate for pain and suffering constitutes damages "on account
of personal injury." 4 Finally, the recovery for lost wages is
also excludable as being "on account of personal injuries," as
long as the lost wages resulted from time in which the taxpayer was out of work as a result of her injuries. See, e. g.,

tary of State determines to be a terrorist attack and which occurred while
such individual was an employee of the United States engaged in the performance of his official duties outside the United States." 26 U. S. C. $ 104
(1988 ed. and Supp. V).

In 1989, $ 104(a) was amended, adding, inter alia, the following provision: "Paragraph (2) shall not apply to any punitive damages in connection
with a case not involving physical injury or physical sickness." Ibid.

4 Though the text of $ 104(a)(2) might be considered ambiguous on this

point, it is by now clear that $ 104(a)(2) encompasses recoveries based on
intangible as well as tangible harms. See United States v. Burke, 504
U. S. 229, 235, n. 6 (1992); id., at 244, and n. 3 (Scalia, J., concurring in
judgment) (acknowledging that " `personal injuries or sickness' " includes
nonphysical injuries).

515us1$75I 08-13-98 12:36:58 PAGES OPINPGT
330 COMMISSIONER v. SCHLEIER

Opinion of the Court
Threlkeld v. Commissioner, 87 T. C. 1294, 1300 (1986) (hypothetical surgeon who loses finger through tortious conduct
may exclude any recovery for lost wages because "[t]his injury . . . will also undoubtedly cause special damages including loss of future income"), aff 'd, 848 F. 2d 81 (CA6 1988).
The critical point this hypothetical illustrates is that each
element of the settlement is recoverable not simply because
the taxpayer received a tort settlement, but rather because
each element of the settlement satisfies the requirement set
forth in $ 104(a)(2) (and in all of the other subsections of

$ 104(a)) that the damages were received "on account of
personal injuries or sickness."

In contrast, no part of respondent's ADEA settlement is
excludable under the plain language of $ 104(a)(2). Respondent's recovery of back wages, though at first glance
comparable to our hypothetical accident victim's recovery of
lost wages, does not fall within $ 104(a)(2)'s exclusion because
it does not satisfy the critical requirement of being "on account of personal injury or sickness." Whether one treats
respondent's attaining the age of 60 or his being laid off on
account of his age as the proximate cause of respondent's loss
of income, neither the birthday nor the discharge can fairly
be described as a "personal injury" or "sickness." Moreover, though respondent's unlawful termination may have
caused some psychological or "personal" injury comparable
to the intangible pain and suffering caused by an automobile
accident, it is clear that no part of respondent's recovery of
back wages is attributable to that injury. Thus, in our automobile hypothetical, the accident causes a personal injury
which in turn causes a loss of wages. In age discrimination,
the discrimination causes both personal injury and loss of
wages, but neither is linked to the other. The amount of
back wages recovered is completely independent of the existence or extent of any personal injury. In short, $ 104(a)(2)
does not permit the exclusion of respondent's back wages

331Cite as: 515 U. S. 323 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
because the recovery of back wages was not "on account of "
any personal injury and because no personal injury affected
the amount of back wages recovered.

Respondent suggests, nonetheless, that the liquidated
damages portion of his settlement fits comfortably within the
plain language of $ 104(a)(2)'s exclusion. He cites our observation in Overnight Motor Transp. Co. v. Missel, 316 U. S.
572 (1942), that liquidated damages under the FLSA "are
compensation, not a penalty or punishment," and that such
damages might compensate for "damages too obscure and
difficult of proof for estimate." Id., at 584-585; see also
Brooklyn Savings Bank v. O'Neil, 324 U. S. 697, 707 (1945).
He argues that Congress must be presumed to have known
of our interpretation of liquidated damages when it incorporated FLSA's liquidated damages provision into the ADEA,
and that Congress must therefore have intended that liquidated damages under the ADEA serve, at least in part, to
compensate plaintiffs for personal injuries that are difficult
to quantify.

We agree with respondent that if Congress had intended
the ADEA's liquidated damages to compensate plaintiffs for
personal injuries, those damages might well come within

$ 104(a)(2)'s exclusion. There are, however, two weaknesses
in respondent's argument. First, even if we assume that
Congress was aware of the Court's observation in Overnight
Motor that the liquidated damages authorized by the FLSA
might provide compensation for some "obscure" injuries, it
does not necessarily follow that Congress would have understood that observation as referring to injuries that were personal rather than economic. Second, and more importantly,
we have previously rejected respondent's argument: We
have already concluded that the liquidated damages provisions of the ADEA were a significant departure from those
in the FLSA, see Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U. S., at 581; Trans
World Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston, 469 U. S., at 126, and we

332 COMMISSIONER v. SCHLEIER

Opinion of the Court
explicitly held in Thurston: "Congress intended for liqui-dated damages to be punitive in nature." Id., at 125.

5

Our holding in Thurston disposes of respondent's argu-ment and requires the conclusion that liquidated damages

under the ADEA, like back wages under the ADEA, are notreceived "on account of personal injury or sickness."

6

5 We find it noteworthy that the Court in Thurston was presented with
many of the arguments offered by respondent today. For example, to
counter the argument that "the ADEA liquidated damages provision is
punitive," the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) argued that "the legislative history of the liquidated damages provision in
the ADEA--as in the FLSA--shows that such damages are designed to
provide full compensation to the employee, rather than primarily to punish
the employer." Brief for EEOC in Transworld Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston,
O. T. 1984, Nos. 83-997 and 83-1325, p. 36. The EEOC continued: "Thus,
Congress focused on the need to be fair to the employee, and to provide
him full compensation for nonpecuniary damages not readily calculable,
including emotional injuries such as humiliation and loss of self respect."
Id., at 36-37. See also id., at 37 (relying on Overnight Motor Transp.
Co. v. Missel, 316 U. S. 572 (1942)). Against this background, the Court's

statement that "Congress intended for liquidated damages to be punitive
in nature" can only be taken as a rejection of the argument that those
damages are also (or are exclusively) compensatory.

We recognize that the House Conference Report accompanying the 1978
Amendments to the ADEA contains language that supports respondent.
See H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 95-950 (1978). However, this evidence was before the Court in Thurston, see Brief for EEOC, at 37, and the Court did
not find it persuasive. We see no reason to reach a different result now.

Moreover, there is much force to the Court's conclusion in Thurston
that the ADEA's liquidated damages provisions are punitive. Under our
decision in Thurston, liquidated damages are only available under the
ADEA if "the employer . . . knew or showed reckless disregard for the
matter of whether its conduct was prohibited by the ADEA." 469 U. S.,
at 126 (internal quotation marks omitted). If liquidated damages were
designed to compensate ADEA victims, we see no reason why the employer's knowledge of the unlawfulness of his conduct should be the determinative factor in the award of liquidated damages.

6 We find odd the dissent's suggestion, post, at 341-342, that our holding

today assumes that the intangible harms of discrimination do not constitute
personal injuries. We of course have no doubt that the intangible harms of
discrimination can constitute personal injury, and that compensation for

Opinion of the Court

III
Respondent seeks to circumvent the plain language of$ 104(a)(2) by relying on the Commissioner's regulation interpreting that section. Section 1.104-1(c) of the TreasuryRegulations, 26 CFR $ 1.104-1(c) (1994), provides:

"Section 104(a)(2) [of the Internal Revenue Code] ex-cludes from gross income the amount of any damages
received (whether by suit or agreement) on account ofpersonal injuries or sickness. The term `damages received (whether by suit or agreement)' means an amountreceived (other than workmen's compensation) through
prosecution of a legal suit or action based upon tort ortort type rights, or through a settlement agreement
entered into in lieu of such prosecution."
Respondent contends that an action to recover damages fora violation of the ADEA is "based upon tort or tort type

rights" as those terms are used in that regulation, and thathis settlement is thus excludable under the plain language of
the regulation.Even if we accept respondent's characterization of the
action, but see infra, at 336, there is no basis for excluding theproceeds of his settlement from his gross income. The regulatory requirement that the amount be received in a tort typeaction is not a substitute for the statutory requirement that
the amount be received "on account of personal injuries orsickness"; it is an additional requirement. Indeed, the statutory requirement is repeated in the regulation. As the Com-missioner argues in her reply brief, an exclusion from gross
income is authorized by the regulation "only when it both (i)was received through prosecution or settlement of an `action
based upon tort or tort type rights'. . . and (ii) was received
such harms may be excludable under $ 104(a)(2). However, to acknowledge
that discrimination may cause intangible harms is not to say that the ADEA
compensates for such harms, or that any of the damages received were on
account of those harms.

`on account of personal injuries or sickness.' " Reply Brieffor Petitioner 2.

7 We need not decide whether the Commissioner would have authority to dispense entirely withthe statutory requirement, because she disclaims any intent to do so, and the text of the regulation does not belieher disclaimer. Thus, respondent's reliance on the text of

the regulation is unpersuasive.

IV
Respondent also suggests that our decision in UnitedStates v. Burke, 504 U. S. 229 (1992), compels the conclusion

that his settlement award is excludable. In Burke, we re-jected the taxpayer's argument that the payment received
in settlement of her backpay claim under the pre-1991 ver-sion of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was excludable from her gross income. Our decision rested on the con-clusion that such a claim was not based upon "tort or tort
type rights" within the meaning of the regulation quoted
above. For two independent reasons, we think Burke pro-vides no foundation for respondent's argument.

First, respondent's ADEA recovery is not based upon"tort or tort type rights" as that term was construed in
Burke. In Burke, we examined the remedial scheme estab-lished by the pre-1991 version of Title VII. Noting that
"Title VII does not allow awards for compensatory or puni-tive damages," and that "instead, it limits available remedies
to backpay, injunctions, and other equitable relief," we con7 We recognize that the Commissioner has arguably in the past treated
the regulation as though its second sentence superseded the first sentence.
See, e. g., United States v. Burke, 504 U. S., at 242, n. 1 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment). In this case, however, the Commissioner unambiguously contends that the regulation is not intended to eliminate the "on
account of" requirement from the statutory language. In view of the
Commissioner's differing interpretations of her own regulation, we do not
accord her present litigating position any special deference. We do agree,
however, that she reads the regulation correctly in this case.

Opinion of the Court
cluded that Title VII was not tortlike because it addressed" `legal injuries of an economic character.' " 504 U. S., at

238, 239.Respondent points to two elements of the ADEA that he
argues distinguish it from the remedial scheme at issue in
Burke: First, the ADEA provides for jury trial, see 29U. S. C. $ 626(b);

Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U. S., at 585; but cf.
Lehman v. Nakshian, 453 U. S. 156 (1981); and second, theADEA allows for liquidated damages. We do not believe

that these features of the ADEA are sufficient to bring itwithin

Burke's conception of a "tort type righ[t]." It is true,
as respondent notes, that we emphasized in Burke the lack
of a right to a jury trial and the absence of any provision for
punitive damages as factors distinguishing the pre-1991 Title
VII action from traditional tort litigation, 504 U. S., at 238-
240. We did not, however, indicate that the presence of
either or both of those factors would be sufficient to bring a
statutory claim within the coverage of the regulation.

In our view, respondent's argument gives insufficient attention to what the Burke Court recognized as the primary
characteristic of an "action based upon . . . tort type rights":
the availability of compensatory remedies. Indeed, we
noted that "one of the hallmarks of traditional tort liability
is the availability of a broad range of damages to compensate
the plaintiff `fairly for injuries caused by the violation of his
legal rights.' " Id., at 235. We continued: "Although these
damages often are described in compensatory terms . . . , in
many cases they are larger than the amount necessary to
reimburse actual monetary loss sustained or even anticipated
by the plaintiff, and thus redress intangible elements of injury that are deemed important, even though not pecuniary
in [their] immediate consequence[s]." Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). Against this background, we found
critical that the pre-1991 version of Title VII provided no
compensation "for any of the other traditional harms associated with personal injury, such as pain and suffering, emo515us1$75I 08-13-98 12:36:58 PAGES OPINPGT
336 COMMISSIONER v. SCHLEIER

Opinion of the Court
tional distress, harm to reputation, or other consequentialdamages."

Id., at 239.
Like the pre-1991 version of Title VII, the ADEA providesno compensation "for any of the other traditional harms associated with personal injury." Monetary remedies under the
ADEA are limited to back wages, which are clearly of an"economic character," and liquidated damages, which we

have already noted serve no compensatory function. Thus,though this is a closer case than

Burke, we conclude that a
recovery under the ADEA is not one that is "based upontort or tort type rights."

Second, and more importantly, the holding of Burke is nar-rower than respondent suggests. In

Burke, following the
framework established in the Internal Revenue Service regulations, we noted that $ 104(a)(2) requires a determinationwhether the underlying action is "based upon tort or tort

type rights." Id., at 234. In so doing, however, we did not
hold that the inquiry into "tort or tort type rights" constituted the beginning and end of the analysis. In particular,
though Burke relied on Title VII's failure to qualify as an
action based upon tort type rights, we did not intend to eliminate the basic requirement found in both the statute and
the regulation that only amounts received "on account of
personal injuries or sickness" come within $ 104(a)(2)'s exclusion. Thus, though satisfaction of Burke's "tort or tort
type" inquiry is a necessary condition for excludability
under $ 104(a)(2), it is not a sufficient condition.8

In sum, the plain language of $ 104(a)(2), the text of the
applicable regulation, and our decision in Burke establish

8 We recognize that a recent Revenue Ruling from the IRS seems to
rely on the same reading of Burke urged by respondent. See Rev. Rul.
93-88, 1993-2 Cum. Bull. 61. Though this Revenue Ruling is not before
us, we note that "the Service's interpretive rulings do not have the force
and effect of regulations," Davis v. United States, 495 U. S. 472, 484 (1990),
and they may not be used to overturn the plain language of a statute.
See, e. g., Bartels v. Birmingham, 332 U. S. 126, 132 (1947).

two independent requirements that a taxpayer must meetbefore a recovery may be excluded under $ 104(a)(2). First,

the taxpayer must demonstrate that the underlying cause ofaction giving rise to the recovery is "based upon tort or tort
type rights"; and second, the taxpayer must show that thedamages were received "on account of personal injuries or
sickness." For the reasons discussed above, we believe thatrespondent has failed to satisfy either requirement, and thus
no part of his settlement is excludable under $ 104(a)(2).The judgment is reversed.

It is so ordered.
Justice Scalia concurs in the judgment.
Justice O'Connor, with whom Justice Thomas joins,and with whom

Justice Souter joins with respect to PartII, dissenting.

Age discrimination inflicts a personal injury. Even underthe principles set forth in

United States v. Burke, 504 U. S.229 (1992), the damages received from a claim of such discrimination under the Age Discrimination in EmploymentAct of 1967 (ADEA) are received "on account of " that
personal injury and therefore excludable from taxable in-come under 26 U. S. C. $ 104(a)(2). Unless the Court reads

$ 104(a)(2) to permit exclusion only of damages received fortangible injuries (

i. e., physical and mental injuries)--a read-ing rejected by eight Members of the Court in Burke and

contradicted by an agency's reasonable interpretation of thestatute it administers--the inescapable conclusion is that
ADEA damages awards, are excludable.

I
It is not disputed that the damages received by respond-ents constitute gross income under 26 U. S. C. $ 61(a) unless

excluded elsewhere; the question is whether such damagesfall within $ 104(a)(2), which excludes from taxable income

338 COMMISSIONER v. SCHLEIER

O'Connor, J., dissenting
"the amount of any damages received (whether by suit oragreement and whether as lump sums or periodic payments)

on account of personal injuries or sickness . . . ." What con-stitutes "damages received on account of personal injuries"
is not obvious from the text or history of the statute, and
since 1960 Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regulations havedefined the phrase with reference to traditional tort principles: "The term `damages received (whether by suit or agree-ment)' means an amount received . . . through prosecution of
a legal suit or action based upon tort or tort type rights,or through a settlement agreement entered into in lieu of
such prosecution." 25 Fed. Reg. 11490 (1960); 26 CFR$ 1.104-1(c) (1994).

At one point in time, determining whether damages received from a lawsuit were excludable under $ 104(a)(2) andthe applicable regulation was a fairly straightforward task.

In Threlkeld v. Commissioner, 87 T. C. 1294, 1299 (1986),aff 'd, 848 F. 2d 81 (CA6 1988), the Tax Court, in a 15-to-1
decision, set forth the test as follows:

"Section 104(a)(2) excludes from income amounts received as damages on account of personal injuries.Therefore, whether the damages received are paid on

account of `personal injuries' should be the beginningand the end of the inquiry. To determine whether the
injury complained of is personal, we must look to the ori-gin and character of the claim . . . , and not to the consequences that result from the injury." 87 T. C., at 1299.
Thus, under Threlkeld, damages from a lawsuit were excludable under $ 104(a)(2) so long as they were received "on
account of any invasion of the rights that an individual is
granted by virtue of being a person in the sight of the law."
Id., at 1308.

Under this standard, ADEA damages surely are excludable. "[D]iscrimination in the workplace causes personal
injury cognizable for purposes of $ 104(a)(2), . . . and there

can be little doubt about this point." Burke, supra, at 249(

O'Connor, J., dissenting). We have recognized that "racial
discrimination . . . is a fundamental injury to the individualrights of a person."

Goodman v. Lukens Steel Co., 482 U. S.
656, 661 (1987). Such offense to the rights and dignity of
the individual attaches regardless of whether the discrimina-tion is based on race, sex, age, or other suspect characteristics. See, e. g., Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U. S. 228,265 (1989) (

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment) ("[W]hatever the final outcome of a decisional process, the inclusionof race or sex as a consideration within it harms both society

and the individual"); EEOC v. Wyoming, 460 U. S. 226, 231
(1983) (Age discrimination "inflict[s] on individual workers
the economic and psychological injury accompanying the loss
of the opportunity to engage in productive and satisfying
occupations"). Thus, prior to 1992, courts generally relied
on Threlkeld to hold that damages awarded under the ADEA
were excludable from income because they were received on
account of personal injuries. See, e. g., Pistillo v. Commissioner, 912 F. 2d 145 (CA6 1990); Rickel v. Commissioner,
900 F. 2d 655 (CA3 1990); Redfield v. Insurance Co. of North
America, 940 F. 2d 542 (CA9 1991).

Things changed, however, with United States v. Burke,
supra. In that case, the Court of Appeals, relying on
Threlkeld, held that race discrimination violative of Title
VII infringes upon a victim's personal rights and thus that
damages received therefrom are properly excludable under

$ 104(a)(2). Agreeing that discrimination violates personal
rights, this Court nevertheless reversed because the statutory remedies do not "recompense a Title VII plaintiff for
any of the other traditional harms associated with personal
injury, such as pain and suffering, emotional distress, harm
to reputation, or other consequential damages (e. g., a ruined
credit rating)." 504 U. S., at 239.

I dissented from the Court's decision in Burke because
"the remedies available to Title VII plaintiffs do not fix the

O'Connor, J., dissenting
character of the right they seek to enforce," id., at 249, andI remain of that view today. Dean Prosser presciently observed years ago that "[t]he relation between the remediesin contract and tort presents a very confusing field, still in
process of development, in which few courts have made any
attempt to chart a path." W. Prosser, Law of Torts 635 (3ded. 1964) (footnote omitted). Three decades later, and despite the Court's attempt to chart a path in Burke (or per-haps because of it), whether a remedy sounds in tort often
depends on arbitrary characterizations. Compare Schmitzv.

Commissioner, 34 F. 3d 790, 794 (CA9 1994) (ADEA liquidated damages are tortlike because they "compensate victims for damages which are too obscure and difficult to
prove"), with Downey v. Commissioner, 33 F. 3d 836, 840
(CA7 1994) (ADEA liquidated damages, "as the name implies, compensate a party for those difficult to prove losses
that often arise from a delay in the performance of obligations--as a type of contract remedy").

The Court today sidesteps these difficulties by laying
down a new per se rule: An illegal discharge based on age
cannot "fairly be described as a `personal injury' or `sickness.' " Ante, at 330. To justify this conclusion, the Court
offers a hypothetical car crash, the injuries from which cause
the taxpayer to miss work. She would be able, in such circumstances, to exclude the recovered lost wages because
they would constitute damages received " `on account of
personal injuries.' " Ante, at 329. By contrast, in the
Court's view, ADEA damages are not excludable because
they are not " `on account of ' any personal injury and because
no personal injury affected the amount of back wages recovered." Ante, at 331.

This reasoning assumes the wrong answer to the fundamental question of this case: What is a personal injury?
Eight Justices in Burke agreed that discrimination inflicts
a personal injury under $ 104(a)(2). See 504 U. S., at 239-
240; id., at 247 (Souter, J., concurring in judgment); id., at

O'Connor, J., dissenting
249 (O'Connor, J., dissenting). Only Justice Scalia dis-agreed, arguing instead that the phrase "personal injuries"

under $ 104(a)(2) "is necessarily limited to injuries to physi-cal or mental health,"

id., at 244; in his view, employment
discrimination, without more, does not inflict a personal injury because it is only a legal injury that causes economicdeprivation,

ibid. Whatever the merits of this view, it was
rejected by the Court in Burke and wisely not advanced bythe Commissioner in this case, see Brief for Petitioner 10,

25, n. 15.Although the Court professes agreement with the view
that "personal injury" within the meaning of $ 104(a)(2) comprehends both tangible and intangible harms, ante, at 329,
n. 4, the Court's analysis contradicts this fundamental premise. The Court's hypothetical contrast between wages lost
due to a car crash and wages lost due to illegal discrimination
would be significant only if one presumes that there is a relevant difference for purposes of $ 104(a)(2) between the car
crash and the illegal discrimination. But such a difference
exists only if one reads "personal injuries," as Justice
Scalia did in Burke, to include only tangible injuries.
Those physical and mental injuries, of course, differ from the
economic and stigmatic harms that discrimination inflicts
upon its victims, but it is a difference without relevance
under $ 104(a)(2)--at least in the view of eight Justices in
Burke, and the view that the Court professes to adopt today,
ante, at 329, n. 4. The injuries from discrimination that the
ADEA redresses--like the harm to reputation and loss of
business caused by a dignitary tortlike defamation, see
Burke, 504 U. S., at 234-235; id., at 247 (Souter, J., concurring in judgment)--may not always manifest themselves in
physical symptoms, but they are no less personal, see supra,
at 339, and thus no less worthy of excludability under

$ 104(a)(2). The Court states: "Whether one treats respondent's attaining the age of 60 or his being laid off on account of
his age as the proximate cause of respondent's loss of income,

342 COMMISSIONER v. SCHLEIER

O'Connor, J., dissenting
neither the birthday nor the discharge can fairly be de-scribed as a `personal injury' or `sickness.' " Ante, at 330.

This assertion, the key to the Court's analysis, is not recon-cilable with the Court's recognition that the intangible
harms of illegal discrimination constitute "personal injuries"under $ 104(a)(2).

The Court argues that although "the intangible harms ofdiscrimination can constitute personal injury" within the
meaning of $ 104(a)(2), "to acknowledge that discriminationmay cause intangible harms is not to say . . . that any of the
damages received were on account of those harms." Ante,at 333, n. 6. The logic of this argument is rather hard to
follow. If the harms caused by discrimination constitutepersonal injury, then amounts received as damages for such
discrimination are received "on account of personal injuries"and should be excludable under $ 104(a)(2).

II
Even overlooking this fundamental defect in the Court'sanalysis, ADEA damages should be excludable from taxable

income under our precedents. The Court in Burke deferredto the applicable IRS regulation, 26 CFR $ 1.104-1(c) (1991),
and stated that "discrimination could constitute a `personalinjury' for purposes of $ 104(a)(2) if the relevant cause of action evidenced a tort-like conception of injury and remedy."504 U. S., at 239. The Court held that a suit based on Title
VII was not based upon "tort or tort type rights," 26 CFR$ 1.104-1(c) (1991), however, because Title VII does not entitle "victims of race-based employment discrimination to ob-tain a jury trial at which `both equitable and legal relief,
including compensatory and, under certain circumstances,punitive damages' may be awarded." 504 U. S., at 240 (quoting Johnson v. Railway Express Agency, Inc., 421 U. S. 454,460 (1975)).

Unlike Title VII, the ADEA expressly provides that anyperson aggrieved may bring a civil action and "shall be enti515us1$75J 08-13-98 12:36:58 PAGES OPINPGT

343Cite as: 515 U. S. 323 (1995)
O'Connor, J., dissenting
tled to a trial by jury of any issue of fact in any . . . actionfor recovery of amounts owing as a result of a violation of

this chapter," 29 U. S. C. $ 626(c)(2) (emphasis added). Moreimportant, the ADEA does not limit relief to back wages,
but instead authorizes courts to grant the panoply of "such
legal or equitable relief as will effectuate the purposes" ofthe Act, 29 U. S. C. $ 626(c)(1) (emphasis added), and it expressly provides for liquidated damages in addition to backwages, 29 U. S. C. $ 626(b). The Court emphasizes that liquidated damages under the ADEA are punitive in nature, ante,at 331-332, but it is an emphasis without relevance. Punitive damages are traditionally available only in tort. See
3 D. Dobbs, Law of Remedies 118 (2d ed. 1993) ("The rule
against punitive damages prevails even if the breach [of contract] is wilful or malicious, as long as the breach does not
amount to an independent tort"). Thus, whether the liquidated damages available under the ADEA are characterized
as compensatory, or as a form of punitive damages, it is clear
that the remedies available under the ADEA go beyond Title
VII's limited focus on " `legal injuries of an economic character,' " Burke, supra, at 239 (quoting Albemarle Paper Co v.
Moody, 422 U. S. 405, 418 (1975)). Plaintiffs claiming age
discrimination, then, are not limited to the "circumscribed
remedies available under Title VII," Burke, 504 U. S., at 240,
but instead may sue under the ADEA, which appears to be
one of the "other federal antidiscrimination statutes offering
. . . broad remedies" distinguished by Burke, see id., at 241.

These distinctions qualify an ADEA suit as a "tort type"
action under Burke, and should entitle a prevailing plaintiff
to exclude damages recovered therefrom from taxable income under $ 104(a)(2) and the applicable IRS regulation, 26
CFR $ 1.104-1(c) (1994). The Court seeks to avoid this conclusion by asserting that our decision in Burke and the IRS
regulation that it interpreted do not conclusively determine
the scope of $ 104(a)(2). Both, according to the Court, ante,
at 336, impose a necessary condition that the suit be tort

O'Connor, J., dissenting
or tort like, but neither states that this showing is suffi-cient for excludability under $ 104(a)(2). This contention is

untenable.The Court's decision in

Burke makes clear that it was deciding conclusively what $ 104(a)(2) permits to be excluded.
After quoting the language of $ 104(a)(2), the Court intro-duced its analysis with the following: "Neither the text nor

the legislative history of $ 104(a)(2) offers any explanationof the term `personal injuries.' Since 1960, however, IRS
regulations formally have linked identification of a personalinjury for purposes of $ 104(a)(2) to traditional tort principles." 504 U. S., at 234. The Court then quoted language
from the IRS regulation, 26 CFR $ 1.104-1(c) (1991), which
identified recovery from a suit " `based on tort or tort type
rights' " as the hallmark of excludability under $ 104(a)(2).
Every Member of the Court so understood the opinion--that
the scope of $ 104(a)(2) is defined in terms of traditional tort
principles. See 504 U. S., at 246-247 (Souter, J., concurring
in judgment); id., at 249 (O'Connor, J., dissenting). Even
Justice Scalia, who disagreed with the Court that "personal injury or sickness" included nonphysical injuries, see
id., at 243-244 (opinion concurring in judgment), agreed that
the IRS regulation is "descriptive of the ambit of $ 104(a)(2)
as a whole," id., at 242, n. 1.

For 35 years the IRS has consistently interpreted its regulation, 26 CFR $ 1.104-1(c), as conclusively establishing the
requirements of $ 104(a)(2). See Rev. Rul. 85-98, 1985-2
Cum. Bull. 51. This was the interpretation the Commissioner pressed upon us in Burke, see Brief for United States
in United States v. Burke, O. T. 1991, No. 91-42, pp. 22-23;
formally affirmed after Burke, see Rev. Rul. 93-88, 1993-2
Cum. Bull. 61; presented to the courts below, see Brief for

the Commissioner expressed a view at odds with 35 years of

administrative rulings, agency practice, and representationsto the courts--a sentence that the Court expands into its

holding today.The Court states that it does not accord the Commissioner's reply brief any special deference in light of the "differing
interpretations of her own regulation," ante, at 334, n. 7.But ignoring the Commissioner's off-hand assertion in this

case does not wipe the slate clean. There still remain 35years of formal interpretations upon which taxpayers have
relied and of agency positions upon which courts, includingthis one, have based their decisions. Unless the Court is
willing to declare these positions to be unreasonable, they
cannot be ignored. See Lyng v. Payne, 476 U. S. 926, 939
(1986). The Court asserts that " `the Service's interpretive
rulings do not have the force and effect of regulations,' "
ante, at 336, n. 8 (quoting Davis v. United States, 495 U. S.
472, 484 (1990)). That is true; it also says nothing about the
deference courts must give to such reasonable interpretations, and a fuller exposition of our precedent indicates that
the level of deference is substantial. Davis states: "Although the Service's interpretive rulings do not have the
force and effect of regulations, we give an agency's interpretations and practices considerable weight where they involve
the contemporaneous construction of a statute and where
they have been in long use." Ibid. (citations omitted).

The Court states that the Commissioner "reads the regulation correctly in this case." Ante, at 334, n. 7. Even if
true, that statement says nothing about whether her interpretation for the past 35 years is reasonable. Both may be
reasonable; such is the nature of ambiguity. In any event, I
do not agree that the Commissioner's reply brief correctly
reads the regulation to impose a necessary, but not sufficient,
condition for excludability under $ 104(a)(2). Although the
regulation purports to interpret the term "damages received
(whether by suit or agreement)," that term is unambiguous;
it plainly includes all kinds of damages--inflicted on property

O'Connor, J., dissenting
or person, based on contract or tort, received by suit oragreement. Read in context, the regulation seeks to define

the overall ambit of $ 104(a)(2)--specifically the concept of"personal injuries," the ambiguity of which gives rise to controversies over the scope of the exclusion under $ 104(a)(2).The regulation is subtitled, "Damages received on account of
personal injuries or sickness," and its first sentence reads:"Section 104(a)(2) excludes from gross income the amount
of any damages received (whether by suit or agreement) onaccount of personal injuries or sickness." 26 CFR $ 1.104-
1(c) (1994). In light of the expansive scope of these state-ments and the futility of any attempt to define only "damages
received," the regulation is more sensibly read as definingthe entire scope of $ 104(a)(2).

Finally, the Court states that agency rules and regulations"may not be used to overturn the plain language of a statute." Ante, at 336, n. 8. But the language of the statute isanything but plain. As the Court noted in Burke, "[n]either
the text nor the legislative history of $ 104(a)(2) offers anyexplanation of the term `personal injuries.' " 504 U. S., at
234. That is why the IRS promulgated its regulation in1960 linking the slippery concept of personal injury to traditional tort principles. The Court today stops short of de-claring this regulation unreasonable; it merely asserts that
the regulation's requirement of a tort or tort like injury isin addition to, not in place of, the statutory requirement that
the damages be received "on account of personal injuries orsickness." But, as noted above, it is not clear where besides
the definition of personal injury there is room in the statutefor the agency to graft on this additional requirement. It is
surely more reasonable to read the regulation as definingan ambiguous statutory phrase, rather than as imposing a
superfluous precondition without any statutory basis.For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.

347OCTOBER TERM, 1994
Syllabus

CHANDRIS, INC., et al. v. LATSIS
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe second circuit

No. 94-325. Argued February 21, 1995--Decided June 14, 1995
Respondent Latsis' duties as a superintendent engineer for petitioner

Chandris, Inc., required him to take voyages on Chandris' ships. He
lost substantial vision in one eye after a condition that he developed
while on one of those voyages went untreated by a ship's doctor. Following his recuperation, he sailed to Germany on the S. S. Galileo and
stayed with the ship while it was in drydock for refurbishment. Subsequently, he sued Chandris for damages for his eye injury under the
Jones Act, which provides a negligence cause of action for "any seaman"
injured "in the course of his employment." The District Court instructed the jury that Latsis was a "seaman" if he was permanently
assigned to, or performed a substantial part of his work on, a vessel,
but that the time Latsis spent with the Galileo while it was in drydock
could not be considered because the vessel was then out of navigation.
The jury returned a verdict for Chandris based solely on Latsis' seaman
status. The Court of Appeals vacated the judgment, finding that the
jury instruction improperly framed the issue primarily in terms of Latsis' temporal relationship to the vessel. It held that the "employmentrelated connection to a vessel in navigation" required for seaman status
under the Jones Act, McDermott Int'l, Inc. v. Wilander, 498 U. S. 337,
355, exists where an individual contributes to a vessel's function or the
accomplishment of its mission; the contribution is limited to a particular
vessel or identifiable group of vessels; the contribution is substantial in
terms of its duration or nature; and the course of the individual's employment regularly exposes him to the hazards of the sea. It also found
that the District Court erred in instructing the jury that the Galileo's
drydock time could not count in the substantial connection equation.

Held:

1. The "employment-related connection to a vessel in navigation" necessary for seaman status comprises two basic elements: The worker's
duties must contribute to the function of the vessel or to the accomplishment of its mission, id., at 355, and the worker must have a connection
to a vessel in navigation (or an identifiable group of vessels) that is
substantial in both its duration and its nature. Pp. 354-372.

(a) The Jones Act provides heightened legal protections to seamen
because of their exposure to the perils of the sea, but does not define

515us1$76z 08-25-98 19:21:31 PAGES OPINPGT
348 CHANDRIS, INC. v. LATSIS

Syllabus
the term "seaman." However, the Court's Jones Act cases establish the
basic principles that the term does not include land-based workers, 498
U. S., at 348, and that seaman status depends "not on the place where
the injury is inflicted . . . but on the nature of the seaman's service, his
status as a member of the vessel, and his relationship . . . to the vessel
and its operation in navigable waters," Swanson v. Marra Brothers,
Inc., 328 U. S. 1, 4. Thus, land-based maritime workers do not become
seamen when they happen to be working aboard a vessel, and seamen
do not lose Jones Act coverage when their service to a vessel takes them
ashore. Latsis' proposed "voyage test"--under which any maritime
worker assigned to a vessel for the duration of a voyage, whose duties
contribute to the vessel's mission, would be a seaman for injuries incurred
during that voyage--conflicts with this status-based inquiry. Desper
v. Starved Rock Ferry Co., 342 U. S. 187, 190, and Grimes v. Raymond
Concrete Pile Co., 356 U. S. 252, 255, distinguished. Pp. 354-364.

(b) Beyond the basic themes outlined here, the Court's cases have
been silent as to the precise relationship a maritime worker must bear
to a vessel in order to come within the Jones Act's ambit, leaving the
lower federal courts the task of developing appropriate criteria to distinguish "ship's company" from land-based maritime workers. Those
courts generally require at least a significant connection to a vessel in
navigation (or to an identifiable fleet of vessels) for a maritime worker
to qualify as a seaman under the Jones Act. Pp. 364-368.

(c) The test for seaman status adopted here has two essential requirements. The first is a broad threshold requirement that makes all
maritime employees who do the ship's work eligible for seaman status.
Wilander, supra, at 355. The second requirement determines which of
these eligible maritime employees have the required employmentrelated connection to a vessel in navigation to make them in fact entitled
to Jones Act benefits. This requirement gives full effect to the remedial scheme created by Congress and separates sea-based maritime employees entitled to Jones Act protection from land-based workers whose
employment does not regularly expose them to the perils of the sea.
Who is a "member of a crew" is a mixed question of law and fact. A
jury should be able to consider all relevant circumstances bearing on
the two requirements. The duration of a worker's connection to a vessel and the nature of the worker's activities, taken together, determine
whether he is a seaman, because the ultimate inquiry is whether the
worker is part of the vessel's crew or simply a land-based employee who
happens to be working on the vessel at a given time. Although seaman
status is not merely a temporal concept, it includes a temporal element.
A worker who spends only a small fraction of his working time aboard
a vessel is fundamentally land-based and therefore not a crew member

Opinion of the Court
regardless of his duties. An appropriate rule of thumb is that a worker
who spends less than about 30 percent of his time in the service of a
vessel in navigation should not qualify as a seaman. This figure is only
a guideline that allows a court to take the question from the jury when
a worker has a clearly inadequate temporal connection to the vessel.
On the other hand, the seaman status inquiry should not be limited
exclusively to an examination of the overall course of a worker's service
with a particular employer, since his seaman status may change with
his basic assignment. Pp. 368-372.

2. The District Court's drydock instruction was erroneous. Whether
a vessel is in navigation is a fact-intensive question that can be removed
from the jury's consideration only where the facts and the law will reasonably support one conclusion. Based upon the record here, the trial
court failed adequately to justify its decision to remove that question
from the jury. Moreover, the court's charge to the jury swept too
broadly in prohibiting the jury from considering the time Latsis spent
with the vessel while in drydock for any purpose. Pp. 372-376.

350 CHANDRIS, INC. v. LATSIS

Opinion of the Court
Wilander, 498 U. S. 337, 355 (1991), is necessary for a mari-time worker to qualify as a seaman under the Jones Act, 46

U. S. C. App. $ 688(a). In Wilander, we addressed thetype of activities that a seaman must perform and held that,
under the Jones Act, a seaman's job need not be limitedto transportation-related functions that directly aid in the
vessel's navigation. We now determine what relationshipa worker must have to the vessel, regardless of the specific
tasks the worker undertakes, in order to obtain seamanstatus.

I
In May 1989, respondent Antonios Latsis was employedby petitioner Chandris, Inc., as a salaried superintendent

engineer. Latsis was responsible for maintaining and up-dating the electronic and communications equipment on
Chandris' fleet of vessels, which consisted of six passengercruise ships. Each ship in the Chandris fleet carried between 12 and 14 engineers who were assigned permanentlyto that vessel. Latsis, on the other hand, was one of two
supervising engineers based at Chandris' Miami office; hisduties ran to the entire fleet and included not only overseeing
the vessels' engineering departments, which required him totake a number of voyages, but also planning and directing
ship maintenance from the shore. Latsis claimed at trialthat he spent 72 percent of his time at sea, App. 58; his immediate supervisor testified that the appropriate figure wascloser to 10 percent, id., at 180.

On May 14, 1989, Latsis sailed for Bermuda aboard theS. S. Galileo to plan for an upcoming renovation of the ship,
which was one of the older vessels in the Chandris fleet.Latsis developed a problem with his right eye on the day of
departure, and he saw the ship's doctor as the Galileo leftport. The doctor diagnosed a suspected detached retina but
failed to follow standard medical procedure, which wouldhave been to direct Latsis to see an ophthalmologist on an
emergency basis. Instead, the ship's doctor recommended

351Cite as: 515 U. S. 347 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
that Latsis relax until he could see an eye specialist whenthe Galileo arrived in Bermuda two days later. No attempt

was made to transport Latsis ashore for prompt medical careby means of a pilot vessel or helicopter during the 11 hours
it took the ship to reach the open sea from Baltimore, andLatsis received no further medical care until after the ship
arrived in Bermuda. In Bermuda, a doctor diagnosed adetached retina and recommended immediate hospitalization
and surgery. Although the operation was a partial success,Latsis lost 75 percent of his vision in his right eye.

Following his recuperation, which lasted approximately sixweeks, Latsis resumed his duties with Chandris. On September 30, 1989, he sailed with the Galileo to Bremerhaven,Germany, where the vessel was placed in drydock for a 6-
month refurbishment. After the conversion, the companyrenamed the vessel the S. S. Meridian. Latsis, who had
been with the ship the entire time it was in drydock inBremerhaven, sailed back to the United States on board the
Meridian and continued to work for Chandris until Novem-ber 1990, when his employment was terminated for reasons
that are not clear from the record.In October 1991, Latsis filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York seekingcompensatory damages under the Jones Act, 46 U. S. C. App.

$ 688, for the negligence of the ship's doctor that resulted inthe significant loss of sight in Latsis' right eye. The Jones
Act provides, in pertinent part, that "[a]ny seaman who shallsuffer personal injury in the course of his employment may,
at his election, maintain an action for damages at law, withthe right of trial by jury . . . ." The District Court instructed the jury that it could conclude that Latsis was aseaman within the meaning of the statute if it found as
follows:

"[T]he plaintiff was either permanently assigned to thevessel or performed a substantial part of his work on the

vessel. In determining whether Mr. Latsis performed a

Opinion of the Court
substantial part of his work on the vessel, you may notconsider the period of time the Galileo was in drydock

in Germany, because during that time period she wasout of navigation. You may, however, consider the time
spent sailing to and from Germany for the conversion.Also, on this first element of being a seaman, seamen do
not include land-based workers." App. 210.
The parties stipulated to the District Court's second require-ment for Jones Act coverage--that Latsis' duties contributed

to the accomplishment of the missions of the Chandris ves-sels. Id., at 211. Latsis did not object to the seaman status
jury instructions in their entirety, but only contested thatportion of the charge which explicitly took from the jury's
consideration the period of time that the Galileo was in dry-dock. The jury returned a verdict in favor of Chandris
solely on the issue of Latsis' status as a seaman under theJones Act.

Id., at 213.Respondent appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which vacated the judgment and remanded thecase for a new trial. 20 F. 3d 45 (1994). The court emphasized that its longstanding test for seaman status under theJones Act required " `a more or less permanent connection
with the ship,' " Salgado v. M. J. Rudolph Corp., 514 F. 2d750, 755 (CA2 1975), a connection that need not be limited to
time spent on the vessel but could also be established by thenature of the work performed. The court thought that the
alternate formulation employed by the District Court (per-manent assignment to the vessel or performance of a substantial part of his work on the vessel), which was derivedfrom

Offshore Co. v. Robison, 266 F. 2d 769, 779 (CA5 1959),improperly framed the issue for the jury primarily, if not

solely, in terms of Latsis' temporal relationship to the vessel.With that understanding of what the language of the

Robi-son test implied, the court concluded that the District

Court's seaman status jury instructions constituted plainerror under established Circuit precedent. The court then

353Cite as: 515 U. S. 347 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
took this case as an opportunity to clarify its seaman statusrequirements, directing the District Court that the jury

should be instructed on remand as follows:

"[T]he test of seaman status under the Jones Act is anemployment-related connection to a vessel in navigation.

The test will be met where a jury finds that (1) the plain-tiff contributed to the function of, or helped accomplish
the mission of, a vessel; (2) the plaintiff 's contributionwas limited to a particular vessel or identifiable group
of vessels; (3) the plaintiff 's contribution was substantialin terms of its (a) duration or (b) nature; and (4) the
course of the plaintiff 's employment regularly exposedthe plaintiff to the hazards of the sea." 20 F. 3d, at 57.

Elsewhere on the same page, however, the court phrased thethird prong as requiring a substantial connection in terms of
both duration and nature. Finally, the Court of Appealsheld that the District Court erred in instructing the jury
that the time Latsis spent with the ship while it was in dry-dock could not count in the substantial connection equation.
Id., at 55-56. Judge Kearse dissented, arguing that the dry-dock instruction was not erroneous and that the remainder
of the charge did not constitute plain error. Id., at 58.We granted certiorari, 513 U. S. 945 (1994), to resolve the
continuing conflict among the Courts of Appeals regardingthe appropriate requirements for seaman status under the
Jones Act.*

Opinion of the Court

II
The Jones Act provides a cause of action in negligence for
"any seaman" injured "in the course of his employment." 46
U. S. C. App. $ 688(a). Under general maritime law prevailing prior to the statute's enactment, seamen were entitled
to "maintenance and cure" from their employer for injuries
incurred "in the service of the ship" and to recover damages
from the vessel's owner for "injuries received by seamen in
consequence of the unseaworthiness of the ship," but they
were "not allowed to recover an indemnity for the negligence
of the master, or any member of the crew." The Osceola,
189 U. S. 158, 175 (1903); see also Cortes v. Baltimore Insular
Line, Inc., 287 U. S. 367, 370-371 (1932). Congress enacted
the Jones Act in 1920 to remove the bar to suit for negligence
articulated in The Osceola, thereby completing the trilogy of
heightened legal protections (unavailable to other maritime
workers) that seamen receive because of their exposure to
the "perils of the sea." See G. Gilmore & C. Black, Law of
Admiralty $ 6-21, pp. 328-329 (2d ed. 1975); Robertson, A
New Approach to Determining Seaman Status, 64 Texas L.
Rev. 79 (1985) (hereinafter Robertson). Justice Story identified this animating purpose behind the legal regime governing maritime injuries when he observed that seamen "are
emphatically the wards of the admiralty" because they "are
by the peculiarity of their lives liable to sudden sickness from

fairly included therein, will be considered by the Court," see, e. g.,
Berkemer v. McCarty, 468 U. S. 420, 443, n. 38 (1984), and our Rule 24.1(a)
provides that a merits brief should not "raise additional questions or
change the substance of the questions already presented" in the petition.
See also Izumi Seimitsu Kogyo Kabushiki Kaisha v. U. S. Philips Corp.,
510 U. S. 27, 31-32 (1993); Taylor v. Freeland & Kronz, 503 U. S. 638,
645-646 (1992). Because petitioners did not raise the issue in the petition
for certiorari, we will not consider any argument they may have under
Rule 51 concerning the effect of respondent's failure to object to the seaman status jury instructions in their entirety.

change of climate, exposure to perils, and exhausting labour."
Harden v. Gordon, 11 F. Cas. 480, 485, 483 (No. 6,047) (CC
Me. 1823). Similarly, we stated in Wilander that "[t]raditional seamen's remedies . . . have been `universally recognized as . . . growing out of the status of the seaman and
his peculiar relationship to the vessel, and as a feature of
the maritime law compensating or offsetting the special hazards and disadvantages to which they who go down to sea in
ships are subjected.' " 498 U. S., at 354 (quoting Seas Shipping Co. v. Sieracki, 328 U. S. 85, 104 (1946) (Stone, C. J.,
dissenting)).

The Jones Act, however, does not define the term "seaman" and therefore leaves to the courts the determination of
exactly which maritime workers are entitled to admiralty's
special protection. Early on, we concluded that Congress
intended the term to have its established meaning under the
general maritime law at the time the Jones Act was enacted.
See Warner v. Goltra, 293 U. S. 155, 159 (1934). In Warner,
we stated that "a seaman is a mariner of any degree, one
who lives his life upon the sea." Id., at 157. Similarly, in

Norton v. Warner Co., 321 U. S. 565, 572 (1944), we suggested
that " `every one is entitled to the privilege of a seaman who,
like seamen, at all times contributes to the labors about the
operation and welfare of the ship when she is upon a voyage' " (quoting The Buena Ventura, 243 F. 797, 799 (SDNY
1916)).

Congress provided some content for the Jones Act requirement in 1927 when it enacted the Longshore and Harbor
Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA), which provides
scheduled compensation (and the exclusive remedy) for injury to a broad range of land-based maritime workers but
which also explicitly excludes from its coverage "a master or
member of a crew of any vessel." 44 Stat. (part 2) 1424, as
amended, 33 U. S. C. $ 902(3)(G). As the Court has stated
on several occasions, the Jones Act and the LHWCA are mu515us1$76J 08-25-98 19:21:31 PAGES OPINPGT
356 CHANDRIS, INC. v. LATSIS

Opinion of the Court
tually exclusive compensation regimes: " `master or member
of a crew' is a refinement of the term `seaman' in the Jones
Act; it excludes from LHWCA coverage those properly
covered under the Jones Act." Wilander, 498 U. S., at 347.
Indeed, "it is odd but true that the key requirement for
Jones Act coverage now appears in another statute." Ibid.
Injured workers who fall under neither category may still
recover under an applicable state workers' compensation
scheme or, in admiralty, under general maritime tort principles (which are admittedly less generous than the Jones Act's
protections). See Cheavens, Terminal Workers' Injury and
Death Claims, 64 Tulane L. Rev. 361, 364-365 (1989).

Despite the LHWCA language, drawing the distinction between those maritime workers who should qualify as seamen
and those who should not has proved to be a difficult task
and the source of much litigation--particularly because "the
myriad circumstances in which men go upon the water confront courts not with discrete classes of maritime employees,
but rather with a spectrum ranging from the blue-water seaman to the land-based longshoreman." Brown v. ITT Rayonier, Inc., 497 F. 2d 234, 236 (CA5 1974). The federal
courts have struggled over the years to articulate generally
applicable criteria to distinguish among the many varieties
of maritime workers, often developing detailed multipronged
tests for seaman status. Since the 1950's, this Court largely
has left definition of the Jones Act's scope to the lower
courts. Unfortunately, as a result, "[t]he perils of the sea,
which mariners suffer and shipowners insure against, have
met their match in the perils of judicial review." Gilmore &
Black, supra, $ 6-1, at 272. Or, as one court paraphrased
Diderot in reference to this body of law: " `We have made a
labyrinth and got lost in it. We must find our way out.' "
Johnson v. John F. Beasley Constr. Co., 742 F. 2d 1054, 1060
(CA7 1984), cert. denied, 469 U. S. 1211 (1985); see 9 Oeuvres

Opinion of the Court

A
In Wilander, decided in 1991, the Court attempted for thefirst time in 33 years to clarify the definition of a "seaman"

under the Jones Act. Jon Wilander was injured while as-signed as a foreman supervising the sandblasting and painting of various fixtures and piping on oil drilling platforms inthe Persian Gulf. His employer claimed that he could not
qualify as a seaman because he did not aid in the navigationfunction of the vessels on which he served. Emphasizing
that the question presented was narrow, we consideredwhether the term "seaman" is limited to only those maritime
workers who aid in a vessel's navigation.After surveying the history of an "aid in navigation" requirement under both the Jones Act and general maritimelaw, we concluded that "all those with that `peculiar relationship to the vessel' are covered under the Jones Act, regard-less of the particular job they perform," 498 U. S., at 354,
and that "the better rule is to define `master or member ofa crew' under the LHWCA, and therefore `seaman' under the
Jones Act, solely in terms of the employee's connection to avessel in navigation,"

ibid. Thus, we held that, although"[i]t is not necessary that a seaman aid in navigation or contribute to the transportation of the vessel, . . . a seaman mustbe doing the ship's work."

Id., at 355. We explained that"[t]he key to seaman status is employment-related connection to a vessel in navigation," and that, although "[w]e arenot called upon here to define this connection in all details,
. . . we believe the requirement that an employee's dutiesmust `contribut[e] to the function of the vessel or to the
accomplishment of its mission' captures well an important
requirement of seaman status." Ibid.Beyond dispensing with the "aid to navigation" requirement, however, Wilander did not consider the requisite con-nection to a vessel in any detail and therefore failed to end
the prevailing confusion regarding seaman status.

B
Respondent urges us to find our way out of the Jones Act"labyrinth" by focusing on the seemingly activity-based

policy underlying the statute (the protection of those whoare exposed to the perils of the sea), and to conclude that
anyone working on board a vessel for the duration of a "voy-age" in furtherance of the vessel's mission has the necessary
employment-related connection to qualify as a seaman.Brief for Respondent 12-17. Such an approach, however,
would run counter to our prior decisions and our understand-ing of the remedial scheme Congress has established for injured maritime workers. A brief survey of the Jones Act'stortured history makes clear that we must reject the initial
appeal of such a "voyage" test and undertake the more diffi-cult task of developing a status-based standard that, although it determines Jones Act coverage without regard tothe precise activity in which the worker is engaged at the
time of the injury, nevertheless best furthers the Jones Act'sremedial goals.

Our Jones Act cases establish several basic principles re-garding the definition of a seaman. First, "[w]hether under
the Jones Act or general maritime law, seamen do not includeland-based workers."

Wilander, supra, at 348; see also All-britton, Seaman Status in

Wilander's Wake, 68 Tulane L.Rev. 373, 387 (1994). Our early Jones Act decisions had not

recognized this fundamental distinction. In InternationalStevedoring Co. v. Haverty, 272 U. S. 50 (1926), we held that
a longshoreman injured while stowing cargo, and whileaboard but not employed by a vessel at dock in navigable
waters, was a seaman covered by the Jones Act. Recogniz-ing that "for most purposes, as the word is commonly used,
stevedores are not `seamen,' " the Court nevertheless con-cluded that "[w]e cannot believe that Congress willingly
would have allowed the protection to men engaged upon thesame maritime duties to vary with the accident of their being
employed by a stevedore rather than by the ship." Id., at

Opinion of the Court
52. Because stevedores are engaged in "a maritime serviceformerly rendered by the ship's crew,"

ibid. (citing Atlantic
Transport Co. of W. Va. v. Imbrovek, 234 U. S. 52, 62 (1914)),we concluded, they should receive the Jones Act's protections. See also Uravic v. F. Jarka Co., 282 U. S. 234, 238
(1931); Jamison v. Encarnacion, 281 U. S. 635, 639 (1930).In 1946, the Court belatedly recognized that Congress had

acted, in passing the LHWCA in 1927, to undercut theCourt's reasoning in the

Haverty line of cases and to emphasize that land-based maritime workers should not be entitledto the seamen's traditional remedies. Our decision in

Swanson v. Marra Brothers, Inc., 328 U. S. 1, 7 (1946), acknowledged that Congress had expressed its intention to "confine
the benefits of the Jones Act to the members of the crew of
a vessel plying in navigable waters and to substitute for the
right of recovery recognized by the Haverty case only such
rights to compensation as are given by [the LHWCA]." See
also South Chicago Coal & Dock Co. v. Bassett, 309 U. S.
251, 257 (1940). Through the LHWCA, therefore, Congress
"explicitly den[ied] a right of recovery under the Jones Act
to maritime workers not members of a crew who are injured
on board a vessel." Swanson, supra, at 6. And this recognition process culminated in Wilander with the Court's
statement that, "[w]ith the passage of the LHWCA, Congress established a clear distinction between land-based and
sea-based maritime workers. The latter, who owe their allegiance to a vessel and not solely to a land-based employer,
are seamen." 498 U. S., at 347.

In addition to recognizing a fundamental distinction between land-based and sea-based maritime employees, our
cases also emphasize that Jones Act coverage, like the jurisdiction of admiralty over causes of action for maintenance
and cure for injuries received in the course of a seaman's
employment, depends "not on the place where the injury is
inflicted . . . but on the nature of the seaman's service, his
status as a member of the vessel, and his relationship as

Opinion of the Court
such to the vessel and its operation in navigable waters."
Swanson, supra, at 4. Thus, maritime workers who obtain
seaman status do not lose that protection automatically whenon shore and may recover under the Jones Act whenever

they are injured in the service of a vessel, regardless of
whether the injury occurs on or off the ship. In O'Donnellv.

Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co., 318 U. S. 36 (1943), the
Court held a shipowner liable for injuries caused to a seamanby a fellow crew member while the former was on shore

repairing a conduit that was a part of the vessel and thatwas used for discharging the ship's cargo. We explained:
"The right of recovery in the Jones Act is given to the seaman as such, and, as in the case of maintenance and cure, the
admiralty jurisdiction over the suit depends not on the place
where the injury is inflicted but on the nature of the service
and its relationship to the operation of the vessel plying in
navigable waters." Id., at 42-43. Similarly, the Court in
Swanson emphasized that the LHWCA "leaves unaffected
the rights of members of the crew of a vessel to recover
under the Jones Act when injured while pursuing their maritime employment whether on board . . . or on shore." 328
U. S., at 7-8. See also Braen v. Pfeifer Oil Transp. Co., 361
U. S. 129, 131-132 (1959).

Our LHWCA cases also recognize the converse: Landbased maritime workers injured while on a vessel in navigation remain covered by the LHWCA, which expressly provides compensation for injuries to certain workers engaged
in "maritime employment" that are incurred "upon the
navigable waters of the United States," 33 U. S. C. $ 903(a).
Thus, in Director, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs v. Perini North River Associates, 459 U. S. 297 (1983),
we held that a worker injured while "working on a barge in
actual navigable waters" of the Hudson River, id., at 300,
n. 4, could be compensated under the LHWCA, id., at 324.
See also Parker v. Motor Boat Sales, Inc., 314 U. S. 244, 244-
245 (1941) (upholding LHWCA coverage for a worker testing

Opinion of the Court
outboard motors who "was drowned when a motor boat inwhich he was riding capsized"). These decisions, which reflect our longstanding view of the LHWCA's scope, indicatethat a maritime worker does not become a "member of a
crew" as soon as a vessel leaves the dock.

It is therefore well settled after decades of judicial inter-pretation that the Jones Act inquiry is fundamentally status

based: Land-based maritime workers do not become seamenbecause they happen to be working on board a vessel when
they are injured, and seamen do not lose Jones Act protec-tion when the course of their service to a vessel takes them
ashore. In spite of this background, respondent and Justice Stevens suggest that any maritime worker who is assigned to a vessel for the duration of a voyage--and whose
duties contribute to the vessel's mission--should be classified
as a seaman for purposes of injuries incurred during that
voyage. See Brief for Respondent 14; post, at 377 (opinion
concurring in judgment). Under such a "voyage test,"
which relies principally upon this Court's statements that
the Jones Act was designed to protect maritime workers who
are exposed to the "special hazards" and "particular perils"
characteristic of work on vessels at sea, see, e. g., Wilander,
supra, at 354, the worker's activities at the time of the injury
would be controlling.

The difficulty with respondent's argument, as the foregoing discussion makes clear, is that the LHWCA repudiated
the Haverty line of cases and established that a worker is no
longer considered to be a seaman simply because he is doing
a seaman's work at the time of the injury. Seaman status
is not coextensive with seamen's risks. See, e. g., Easley v.
Southern Shipbuilding Corp., 965 F. 2d 1, 4-5 (CA5 1992),
cert. denied, 506 U. S. 1050 (1993); Robertson 93 (following
"the overwhelming weight of authority in taking it as given
that seaman status cannot be established by any worker who
fails to demonstrate that a significant portion of his work
was done aboard a vessel" and acknowledging that "[s]ome

workers who unmistakably confront the perils of the sea,often in extreme form, are thereby left out of the seamen's

protections" (footnote omitted)). A "voyage test" wouldconflict with our prior understanding of the Jones Act as fundamentally status based, granting the negligence cause of
action to those maritime workers who form the ship's com-pany.

Swanson, supra, at 4-5; O'Donnell, supra, at 42-43.
Desper v. Starved Rock Ferry Co., 342 U. S. 187, 190 (1952),is not to the contrary. Although some language in that case

does suggest that whether an individual is a seaman dependsupon "the activity in which he was engaged at the time of
injury," the context of that discussion reveals that "activity"
referred to the worker's employment as a laborer on a vessel
undergoing seasonal repairs while out of navigation, and not
to his precise task at the time of injury. Similarly, despite
Justice Harlan's suggestion in dissent that the Court's decision in Grimes v. Raymond Concrete Pile Co., 356 U. S. 252
(1958), necessarily construed the word seaman "to mean
nothing more than a person injured while working at sea,"
id., at 255, our short per curiam opinion in that case does
not indicate that we adopted so expansive a reading of the
statutory term. Citing our prior cases which emphasized
that the question of seaman status is normally for the factfinder to decide, see, e. g., Senko v. LaCrosse Dredging Corp.,
352 U. S. 370, 371-372 (1957); Bassett, 309 U. S., at 257-258,
we reversed the judgment of the Court of Appeals and held
simply that the jury could have inferred from the facts presented that the petitioner was a member of a crew in light
of his overall service to the company (as the District Court
had concluded in ruling on a motion for a directed verdict at
the close of petitioner's case). Grimes, supra, at 253. That
neither Desper nor Grimes altered our established course in
favor of a voyage test is confirmed by reference to our later
decision in Braen, supra, at 131, in which we repeated that
"[t]he injured party must of course have `status as a member
of the vessel' for it is seamen, not others who may work on

Opinion of the Court
the vessel (Swanson v. Marra Bros., 328 U. S. 1, 4), to whomCongress extended the protection of the Jones Act."

We believe it is important to avoid " `engrafting upon thestatutory classification of a "seaman" a judicial gloss so protean, elusive, or arbitrary as to permit a worker to walk into
and out of coverage in the course of his regular duties.' "
Barrett v. Chevron, U. S. A., Inc., 781 F. 2d 1067, 1075 (CA5
1986) (en banc) (quoting Longmire v. Sea Drilling Corp.,610 F. 2d 1342, 1347, n. 6 (CA5 1980)). In evaluating the

employment-related connection of a maritime worker to avessel in navigation, courts should not employ "a `snapshot'
test for seaman status, inspecting only the situation as it
exists at the instant of injury; a more enduring relationship
is contemplated in the jurisprudence." Easley, supra, at 5.
Thus, a worker may not oscillate back and forth between
Jones Act coverage and other remedies depending on the
activity in which the worker was engaged while injured.
Reeves v. Mobile Dredging & Pumping Co., 26 F. 3d 1247,
1256 (CA3 1994). Unlike Justice Stevens, see post, at 383,
we do not believe that any maritime worker on a ship at sea
as part of his employment is automatically a member of the
crew of the vessel within the meaning of the statutory terms.
Our rejection of the voyage test is also consistent with the
interests of employers and maritime workers alike in being
able to predict who will be covered by the Jones Act (and,
perhaps more importantly for purposes of the employers'
workers' compensation obligations, who will be covered by
the LHWCA) before a particular workday begins.

To say that our cases have recognized a distinction between land-based and sea-based maritime workers that precludes application of a voyage test for seaman status, however, is not to say that a maritime employee must work only
on board a vessel to qualify as a seaman under the Jones Act.
In Southwest Marine, Inc. v. Gizoni, 502 U. S. 81 (1991), decided only a few months after Wilander, we concluded that
a worker's status as a ship repairman, one of the enumerated

515us1$76J 08-25-98 19:21:31 PAGES OPINPGT
364 CHANDRIS, INC. v. LATSIS

Opinion of the Court
occupations encompassed within the term "employee" underthe LHWCA, 33 U. S. C. $ 902(3), did not necessarily restrict

the worker to a remedy under that statute. We explainedthat, "[w]hile in some cases a ship repairman may lack the
requisite connection to a vessel in navigation to qualify forseaman status, . . . not all ship repairmen lack the requisite
connection as a matter of law. This is so because `[i]t is notthe employee's particular job that is determinative, but the
employee's connection to a vessel.' " Gizoni, supra, at 89(quoting

Wilander, 498 U. S., at 354) (footnote omitted).Thus, we concluded, the Jones Act remedy may be available

to maritime workers who are employed by a shipyard andwho spend a portion of their time working on shore but
spend the rest of their time at sea.Beyond these basic themes, which are sufficient to foreclose respondent's principal argument, our cases are largelysilent as to the precise relationship a maritime worker must
bear to a vessel in order to come within the Jones Act'sambit. We have, until now, left to the lower federal courts
the task of developing appropriate criteria to distinguish the"ship's company" from those members of the maritime community whose employment is essentially land based.

C
The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit was apparentlythe first to develop a generally applicable test for seaman

status. In Carumbo v. Cape Cod S. S. Co., 123 F. 2d 991(1941), the court retained the preSwanson view that "theword `seaman' under the Jones Act [did] not mean the same

thing as `member of a crew' under the [LHWCA]," 123 F. 2d,at 994. It concluded that "one who does any sort of work
aboard a ship in navigation is a `seaman' within the meaningof the Jones Act."

Id., at 995. To the phrase "member ofa crew," on the other hand, the court gave a more restrictive

meaning. The court adopted three elements to define thephrase that had been used at various times in prior cases,

515us1$76J 08-25-98 19:21:31 PAGES OPINPGT

365Cite as: 515 U. S. 347 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
holding that "[t]he requirements that the ship be in naviga-tion; that there be a more or less permanent connection with

the ship; and that the worker be aboard primarily to aid innavigation appear to us to be the essential and decisive elements of the definition of a `member of a crew.' " Ibid. Cf.
Senko, supra, at 375 (Harlan, J., dissenting) ("According topast decisions, to be a `member of a crew' an individual must

have some connection, more or less permanent, with a shipand a ship's company"). Once it became clear that the
phrase "master or member of a crew" from the LHWCA iscoextensive with the term "seaman" in the Jones Act, courts
accepted the Carumbo formulation of master or member of
a crew in the Jones Act context. See Boyd v. Ford Motor
Co., 948 F. 2d 283 (CA6 1991); Estate of Wenzel v. Seaward
Marine Services, Inc., 709 F. 2d 1326, 1327 (CA9 1983); Whittington v. Sewer Constr. Co., 541 F. 2d 427, 436 (CA4 1976);
Griffith v. Wheeling Pittsburgh Steel Corp., 521 F. 2d 31,
36 (CA3 1975), cert. denied, 423 U. S. 1054 (1976); McKie v.
Diamond Marine Co., 204 F. 2d 132, 136 (CA5 1953). The
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit initially was among
the jurisdictions to adopt the Carumbo formulation as the
basis of its seaman status inquiry, see Salgado v. M. J. Rudolph Corp., 514 F. 2d, at 755, but that court took the instant
case as an opportunity to modify the traditional test somewhat (replacing the "more or less permanent connection"
prong with a requirement that the connection be "substantial
in terms of its (a) duration and (b) nature"), 20 F. 3d, at 57.

The second major body of seaman status law developed
in the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which has a
substantial Jones Act caseload, in the wake of Offshore Co.
v. Robison, 266 F. 2d 769 (CA5 1959). At the time of his
injury, Robison was an oil worker permanently assigned to
a drilling rig mounted on a barge in the Gulf of Mexico. In
sustaining the jury's award of damages to Robison under the
Jones Act, the court abandoned the aid in navigation requirement of the traditional test and held as follows:

366 CHANDRIS, INC. v. LATSIS

Opinion of the Court
"[T]here is an evidentiary basis for a Jones Act case togo to the jury: (1) if there is evidence that the injured

workman was assigned permanently to a vessel . . . orperformed a substantial part of his work on the vessel;
and (2) if the capacity in which he was employed or theduties which he performed contributed to the function
of the vessel or to the accomplishment of its mission, orto the operation or welfare of the vessel in terms of its
maintenance during its movement or during anchoragefor its future trips."

Id., at 779 (footnote omitted).

Soon after Robison, the Fifth Circuit modified the test toallow seaman status for those workers who had the requisite

connection with an "identifiable fleet" of vessels, a finitegroup of vessels under common ownership or control.

Bran-iff v. Jackson Avenue-Gretna Ferry, Inc., 280 F. 2d 523, 528

(1960). See also Barrett, 781 F. 2d, at 1074; Bertrand v. International Mooring & Marine, Inc., 700 F. 2d 240 (CA51983), cert. denied, 464 U. S. 1069 (1984). The modified Robison formulation, which replaced the Carumbo version as thedefinitive test for seaman status in the Fifth Circuit, has
been highly influential in other courts as well. See Robert-son 95; Miller v. Patton-Tully Transp. Co., 851 F. 2d 202, 204
(CA8 1988); Caruso v. Sterling Yacht & Shipbuilders, Inc.,828 F. 2d 14, 15 (CA11 1987);

Bennett v. Perini Corp., 510F. 2d 114, 115 (CA1 1975).

While the Carumbo and Robison approaches may notseem all that different at first glance, subsequent developments in the Fifth Circuit's Jones Act jurisprudence added astrictly temporal gloss to the Jones Act inquiry. Under Barrett v. Chevron, U. S. A., Inc., supra, if an employee's regularduties require him to divide his time between vessel and
land, his status as a crew member is determined "in the con-text of his entire employment" with his current employer.
Id., at 1075. See also Allbritton, 68 Tulane L. Rev., at 386;
Longmire, 610 F. 2d, at 1347 (explaining that a worker's sea-man status "should be addressed with reference to the na515us1$76J 08-25-98 19:21:31 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
ture and location of his occupation taken as a whole"). In
Barrett, the court noted that the worker "performed seventy
to eighty percent of his work on platforms and no more thantwenty to thirty percent of his work on vessels" and then

concluded that, "[b]ecause he did not perform a substantial
portion of his work aboard a vessel or fleet of vessels, hefailed to establish that he was a member of the crew of a

vessel." 781 F. 2d, at 1076. Since Barrett, the Fifth Circuitconsistently has analyzed the problem in terms of the percentage of work performed on vessels for the employer inquestion--and has declined to find seaman status where the
employee spent less than 30 percent of his time aboard ship.
See, e. g., Palmer v. Fayard Moving & Transp. Corp., 930
F. 2d 437, 439 (1991); Lormand v. Superior Oil Co., 845
F. 2d 536, 541 (1987), cert. denied, 484 U. S. 1031 (1988);
cf. Leonard v. Dixie Well Service & Supply, Inc., 828 F. 2d
291, 295 (1987); Pickle v. International Oilfield Divers,
Inc., 791 F. 2d 1237, 1240 (1986), cert. denied, 479 U. S. 1059
(1987).

Although some Courts of Appeals have varied the applicable tests to some degree, see, e. g., Johnson v. John F.
Beasley Constr. Co., 742 F. 2d, at 1062-1063, the traditional
Carumbo seaman status formulation and the subsequent
Robison modification are universally recognized, and one or
the other is applied in every Federal Circuit to have considered the issue. See Bull, Seaman Status Revisited: A Practical Guide To Status Determination, 6 U. S. F. Mar. L. J. 547,
562-572 (1994) (collecting cases). The federal courts generally require at least a significant connection to a vessel in
navigation (or to an identifiable fleet of vessels) for a maritime worker to qualify as a seaman under the Jones Act.
Although the traditional test requires a "more or less permanent connection" and the Robison formulation calls for
"substantial" work aboard a vessel, "this general requirement varies little, if at all, from one jurisdiction to another,"
Bull, supra, at 587, and "[t]he courts have repeatedly held

515us1$76J 08-25-98 19:21:31 PAGES OPINPGT
368 CHANDRIS, INC. v. LATSIS

Opinion of the Court
that the relationship creating seaman status must be sub-stantial in point of time and work, and not merely sporadic,"

id., at 587-588. D

From this background emerge the essential contours of the"employment-related connection to a vessel in navigation,"
Wilander, 498 U. S., at 355, required for an employee to qual-ify as a seaman under the Jones Act. We have said that, in
giving effect to the term "seaman," our concern must be "todefine the meaning for the purpose of a particular statute"
and that its use in the Jones Act "must be read in the lightof the mischief to be corrected and the end to be attained."
Warner, 293 U. S., at 158. Giving effect to those guidingprinciples, we think that the essential requirements for seaman status are twofold. First, as we emphasized in Wilander, "an employee's duties must `contribut[e] to the func-tion of the vessel or to the accomplishment of its mission.' "

498 U. S., at 355 (quoting Robison, 266 F. 2d, at 779). TheJones Act's protections, like the other admiralty protections
for seamen, only extend to those maritime employees who dothe ship's work. But this threshold requirement is very
broad: "All who work at sea in the service of a ship" are
eligible for seaman status. 498 U. S., at 354.Second, and most important for our purposes here, a seaman must have a connection to a vessel in navigation (or toan identifiable group of such vessels) that is substantial in
terms of both its duration and its nature. The fundamentalpurpose of this substantial connection requirement is to give
full effect to the remedial scheme created by Congress andto separate the sea-based maritime employees who are entitled to Jones Act protection from those land-based workerswho have only a transitory or sporadic connection to a vessel
in navigation, and therefore whose employment does not reg-ularly expose them to the perils of the sea. See 1B A. Jenner, Benedict on Admiralty $ 11a, pp. 2-10.1 to 2-11 (7th ed.1994) ("If it can be shown that the employee performed a

515us1$76J 08-25-98 19:21:31 PAGES OPINPGT

369Cite as: 515 U. S. 347 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
significant part of his work on board the vessel on whichhe was injured, with at least some degree of regularity and

continuity, the test for seaman status will be satisfied" (foot-note omitted)). This requirement therefore determines
which maritime employees in Wilander's broad category of
persons eligible for seaman status because they are "doingthe ship's work," 498 U. S., at 355, are in fact entitled to the

benefits conferred upon seamen by the Jones Act becausethey have the requisite employment-related connection to a
vessel in navigation.It is important to recall that the question of who is a
"member of a crew," and therefore who is a "seaman," is a
mixed question of law and fact. Because statutory terms
are at issue, their interpretation is a question of law and it
is the court's duty to define the appropriate standard. Wilander, 498 U. S., at 356. On the other hand, "[i]f reasonable
persons, applying the proper legal standard, could differ as
to whether the employee was a `member of a crew,' it is a
question for the jury." Ibid. See also Senko, 352 U. S., at
374 (explaining that "the determination of whether an injured person was a `member of a crew' is to be left to the
finder of fact" and that "a jury's decision is final if it has
a reasonable basis"). The jury should be permitted, when
determining whether a maritime employee has the requisite
employment-related connection to a vessel in navigation to
qualify as a member of the vessel's crew, to consider all relevant circumstances bearing on the two elements outlined
above.

In defining the prerequisites for Jones Act coverage, we
think it preferable to focus upon the essence of what it means
to be a seaman and to eschew the temptation to create detailed tests to effectuate the congressional purpose, tests
that tend to become ends in and of themselves. The principal formulations employed by the Courts of Appeals--"more
or less permanent assignment" or "connection to a vessel
that is substantial in terms of its duration and nature"--are

515us1$76J 08-25-98 19:21:31 PAGES OPINPGT
370 CHANDRIS, INC. v. LATSIS

Opinion of the Court
simply different ways of getting at the same basic point: TheJones Act remedy is reserved for sea-based maritime employees whose work regularly exposes them to "the specialhazards and disadvantages to which they who go down to
sea in ships are subjected." Sieracki, 328 U. S., at 104
(Stone, C. J., dissenting). Indeed, it is difficult to discernmajor substantive differences in the language of the two

phrases. In our view, "the total circumstances of an individ-ual's employment must be weighed to determine whether he
had a sufficient relation to the navigation of vessels and theperils attendant thereon."

Wallace v. Oceaneering Int'l,
727 F. 2d 427, 432 (CA5 1984). The duration of a worker's
connection to a vessel and the nature of the worker's activities, taken together, determine whether a maritime employee is a seaman because the ultimate inquiry is whether
the worker in question is a member of the vessel's crew or
simply a land-based employee who happens to be working on
the vessel at a given time.

Although we adopt the centerpiece of the formulation used
by the Court of Appeals in this case--that a seaman must
have a connection with a vessel in navigation that is substantial in both duration and nature--we should point out how
our understanding of the import of that language may be
different in some respects from that of the court below. The
Court of Appeals suggested that its test for seaman status
"does not unequivocally require a Jones Act seaman to be
substantially connected to a vessel" in terms of time if the
worker performs important work on board on a steady, although not necessarily on a temporally significant, basis.
20 F. 3d, at 53. Perhaps giving effect to this intuition, or
perhaps reacting to the temporal gloss placed on the Robison
language by later Fifth Circuit decisions, the court phrased
its standard at one point as requiring a jury to find that a
Jones Act plaintiff 's contribution to the function of the vessel
was substantial in terms of its duration or nature. 20 F. 3d,

Opinion of the Court
as opposed to "duration and nature") the Court of Appealsintended to adopt for the substantial connection requirement--or indeed whether the court saw a significant differ-ence between the two. Nevertheless, we think it is important that a seaman's connection to a vessel in fact be
substantial in both respects.We agree with the Court of Appeals that seaman status

is not merely a temporal concept, but we also believe thatit necessarily includes a temporal element. A maritime
worker who spends only a small fraction of his working timeon board a vessel is fundamentally land based and therefore
not a member of the vessel's crew, regardless of what his
duties are. Naturally, substantiality in this context is determined by reference to the period covered by the Jones Act
plaintiff 's maritime employment, rather than by some absolute measure. Generally, the Fifth Circuit seems to have
identified an appropriate rule of thumb for the ordinary case:
A worker who spends less than about 30 percent of his time
in the service of a vessel in navigation should not qualify as
a seaman under the Jones Act. This figure of course serves
as no more than a guideline established by years of experience, and departure from it will certainly be justified in appropriate cases. As we have said, "[t]he inquiry into seaman
status is of necessity fact specific; it will depend on the nature of the vessel and the employee's precise relation to it."
Wilander, 498 U. S., at 356. Nevertheless, we believe that
courts, employers, and maritime workers can all benefit from
reference to these general principles. And where undisputed facts reveal that a maritime worker has a clearly inadequate temporal connection to vessels in navigation, the
court may take the question from the jury by granting
summary judgment or a directed verdict. See, e. g., Palmer,
930 F. 2d, at 439.

On the other hand, we see no reason to limit the seaman
status inquiry, as petitioners contend, exclusively to an examination of the overall course of a worker's service with a

particular employer. Brief for Petitioners 14-15. When amaritime worker's basic assignment changes, his seaman status may change as well. See Barrett, 781 F. 2d, at 1077(Rubin, J., dissenting) ("An assignment to work as a crew
member, like the voyage of a vessel, may be brief, and the
Robison test is applicable in deciding the worker's statusduring any such employment"); Longmire, 610 F. 2d, at 1347,

n. 6. For example, we can imagine situations in which some-one who had worked for years in an employer's shoreside
headquarters is then reassigned to a ship in a classic sea-man's job that involves a regular and continuous, rather than
intermittent, commitment of the worker's labor to the func-tion of a vessel. Such a person should not be denied seaman
status if injured shortly after the reassignment, just assomeone actually transferred to a desk job in the company's
office and injured in the hallway should not be entitled toclaim seaman status on the basis of prior service at sea. If
a maritime employee receives a new work assignment inwhich his essential duties are changed, he is entitled to have
the assessment of the substantiality of his vessel-relatedwork made on the basis of his activities in his new position.
See Cheavens, 64 Tulane L. Rev., at 389-390. Thus, nothingin our opinion forecloses Jones Act coverage, in appropriate
cases, for Justice Stevens' paradigmatic maritime workerinjured while reassigned to "a lengthy voyage on the high
seas," post, at 386. While our approach maintains thestatus-based inquiry this Court's earlier cases contemplate,
we recognize that seaman status also should not be someimmutable characteristic that maritime workers who spend
only a portion of their time at sea can never attain.

III
One final issue remains for our determination: whether theDistrict Court erred in instructing the jurors that, "[i]n determining whether Mr. Latsis performed a substantial partof his work on the vessel, [they could] not consider the period

Opinion of the Court
of time the Galileo was in drydock in Germany, because dur-ing that time period she was out of navigation." We agree

with the Court of Appeals that it did.The foregoing discussion establishes that, to qualify as a
seaman under the Jones Act, a maritime employee must have
a substantial employment-related connection to a vessel in
navigation. See Wilander, supra, at 354-355. Of course,
any time Latsis spent with the Galileo while the ship wasout of navigation could not count as time spent at sea for

purposes of that inquiry, and it would have been appropriatefor the District Court to make this clear to the jury. Yet
the underlying inquiry whether a vessel is or is not "in navigation" for Jones Act purposes is a fact-intensive question
that is normally for the jury and not the court to decide.
See Butler v. Whiteman, 356 U. S. 271 (1958) (per curiam);
2 M. Norris, Law of Seamen $ 30.13, p. 363 (4th ed. 1985)
("Whether the vessel is in navigation presents a question of
fact to be determined by the trier of the facts. When the
case is tried to a jury the fact question should be left to their
consideration if sufficient evidence has been presented to
provide the basis for jury consideration"). Removing the
issue from the jury's consideration is only appropriate where
the facts and the law will reasonably support only one conclusion, Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U. S. 242, 250-
251 (1986), and the colloquy between the court and counsel
does not indicate that the District Court made any such findings before overruling respondent's objection to the drydock
instruction. See Tr. 432. Based upon the record before us,
we think the court failed adequately to justify its decision to
remove the question whether the Galileo was "in navigation" while in Bremerhaven from the jury.

Under our precedent and the law prevailing in the Circuits, it is generally accepted that "a vessel does not cease
to be a vessel when she is not voyaging, but is at anchor,
berthed, or at dockside," DiGiovanni v. Traylor Bros., Inc.,

827 (1992), even when the vessel is undergoing repairs. See
Butler, supra, at 271; Senko, 352 U. S., at 373; Norris, supra,
at 364 ("[A] vessel is in navigation . . . when it returns froma voyage and is taken to a drydock or shipyard to undergo

repairs in preparation to making another trip, and likewise
a vessel is in navigation, although moored to a dock, if itremains in readiness for another voyage" (footnotes omitted)). At some point, however, repairs become sufficientlysignificant that the vessel can no longer be considered in navigation. In West v. United States, 361 U. S. 118 (1959), weheld that a shoreside worker was not entitled to recover for
unseaworthiness because the vessel on which he was injured
was undergoing an overhaul for the purpose of making her
seaworthy and therefore had been withdrawn from navigation. We explained that, in such cases, "the focus should be
upon the status of the ship, the pattern of the repairs, and
the extensive nature of the work contracted to be done."
Id., at 122. See also United N. Y. and N. J. Sandy Hook Pilots Assn. v. Halecki, 358 U. S. 613 (1959); Desper, 342 U. S.,
at 191. The general rule among the Courts of Appeals is
that vessels undergoing repairs or spending a relatively
short period of time in drydock are still considered to be "in
navigation" whereas ships being transformed through
"major" overhauls or renovations are not. See Bull, 6 U. S.
F. Mar. L. J., at 582-584 (collecting cases).

Obviously, while the distinction at issue here is one of degree, the prevailing view is that "major renovations can take
a ship out of navigation, even though its use before and after
the work will be the same." McKinley v. All Alaskan Seafoods, Inc., 980 F. 2d 567, 570 (CA9 1992). Our review of the
record in this case uncovered relatively little evidence bearing on the Galileo's status during the repairs, and even less
discussion of the question by the District Court. On the one
hand, the work on the Chandris vessel took only about six
months, which seems to be a relatively short period of time
for important repairs on oceangoing vessels. Cf. id., at 571

Wixom v. Boland Marine & Manufacturing Co., 614 F. 2d 956 (CA5 1980) (similar3-year project); see also

Senko, supra, at 373 (noting that
"[e]ven a transoceanic liner may be confined to berth for
lengthy periods, and while there the ship is kept in repairby its `crew' "--and that "[t]here can be no doubt that a member of its crew would be covered by the Jones Act duringthis period, even though the ship was never in transit during
his employment"). On the other hand, Latsis' own descrip-tion of the work performed suggests that the modifications
to the vessel were actually quite significant, including the
removal of the ship's bottom plates and propellers, the addition of bow thrusters, overhaul of the main engines, reconstruction of the boilers, and renovations of the cabins and
other passenger areas of the ship. See App. 93-94. On
these facts, which are similar to those in McKinley, it is possible that Chandris could be entitled to partial summary
judgment or a directed verdict concerning whether the Galileo remained in navigation while in drydock; the record, however, contains no stipulations or findings by the District
Court to justify its conclusion that the modifications to the
Galileo were sufficiently extensive to remove the vessel from
navigation as a matter of law. On that basis, we agree with
the Court of Appeals that the District Court's drydock instruction was erroneous.

Even if the District Court had been justified in directing
a verdict on the question whether the Galileo remained in
navigation while in Bremerhaven, we think that the court's
charge to the jury swept too broadly. Instead of simply noting the appropriate legal conclusion and instructing the jury
not to consider the time Latsis spent with the vessel in drydock as time spent with a vessel in navigation, the District
Court appears to have prohibited the jury from considering
Latsis' stay in Bremerhaven for any purpose. In our view,
Latsis' activities while the vessel was in drydock are at least

Opinion of the Court
marginally relevant to the underlying inquiry (whether Lat-sis was a seaman and not a land-based maritime employee).

Naturally, the jury would be free to draw several inferencesfrom Latsis' work during the conversion, not all of which
would be in his favor. But the choice among such permissi-ble inferences should have been left to the jury, and we think
the District Court's broadly worded instruction improperlydeprived the jury of that opportunity by forbidding the consideration of Latsis' time in Bremerhaven at all.

IV
Under the Jones Act, "[i]f reasonable persons, applying theproper legal standard, could differ as to whether the employee was a `member of a crew,' it is a question for the jury."Wilander, 498 U. S., at 356. On the facts of this case, given
that essential points are in dispute, reasonable factfinderscould disagree as to whether Latsis was a seaman. Because
the question whether the Galileo remained "in navigation"while in drydock should have been submitted to the jury, and
because the decision on that issue might affect the outcomeof the ultimate seaman status inquiry, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals remanding the case to the Dis-trict Court for a new trial.

On remand, the District Court should charge the jury in amanner consistent with our holding that the "employmentrelated connection to a vessel in navigation" necessary toqualify as a seaman under the Jones Act, id., at 355, comprises two basic elements: The worker's duties must contrib-ute to the function of the vessel or to the accomplishment of
its mission, and the worker must have a connection to a ves-sel in navigation (or an identifiable group of vessels) that is
substantial in terms of both its duration and its nature. Asto the latter point, the court should emphasize that the Jones
Act was intended to protect sea-based maritime workers,who owe their allegiance to a vessel, and not land-based employees, who do not. By instructing juries in Jones Act

cases accordingly, courts can give proper effect to the reme-dial scheme Congress has created for injured maritime

workers. It is so ordered.

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Thomas and
Justice Breyer join, concurring in the judgment.

The majority has reached the odd conclusion that a mari-time engineer, injured aboard ship on the high seas while

performing his duties as an employee of the ship, might notbe a "seaman" within the meaning of the Jones Act. This
decision is unprecedented. It ignores the critical distinctionbetween work performed aboard ship during a voyage--
when the members of the crew encounter "the perils of thesea"--and maritime work performed on a vessel moored to
a dock in a safe harbor. In my judgment, an employee of theship who is injured at sea in the course of his employment is
always a "seaman." I would leave more ambiguous, shore-bound cases for another day. Accordingly, though I concur
in the Court's disposition of this case, returning it to theDistrict Court for a new trial, I disagree with the standard
this Court directs the trial court to apply on remand.

I
The Jones Act,1 46 U. S. C. App. $ 688, provides, in part,"[a]ny seaman who shall suffer personal injury in the course

of his employment may, at his election, maintain an actionfor damages at law." In this case, it is undisputed that respondent, Antonios Latsis, was injured in the course of hisemployment. When the injury occurred, he was on board
the steamship Galileo, a vessel in navigation in the AtlanticOcean. He was therefore exposed to the perils of the sea;
indeed, as the Court of Appeals correctly noted, "his injury

was the result of such a peril." 2 Respondent was not amere passenger; he was performing duties for his employer

that contributed to the ship's mission. In common parlance,then, he was a member of the crew of the Galileo. I think
these facts are sufficient to establish that respondent was, asa matter of law, a "seaman" within the meaning of the Jones
Act at the time of his injury. Although the character of Lat-sis' responsibilities before the voyage began and after it
ended would be relevant in determining his status if he hadbeen injured while the ship was in port, they have no bearing
on his status as a member of the Galileo's crew during the
voyage.

This conclusion follows, first, from the language of theJones Act and of the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA), 33 U. S. C. $ 901 et seq. The lat-ter, a federal workers' compensation scheme for shore-based
maritime workers, exempts any "master or member of acrew of any vessel," 33 U. S. C. $ 902(3)(G)--a formulation
that, we have held, is coextensive with the term "seaman" inthe Jones Act.

McDermott Int'l, Inc. v. Wilander, 498 U. S.
337, 347 (1991). In ordinary parlance, an employee of a ship
at sea who is on that ship as part of his employment and whocontributes to the ship's mission is both a "seaman" and a

"member of [the] crew of [the] vessel." Indeed, I am notsure how these words can reasonably be read to exclude such
an employee. Surely none of the statutory language sug-gests that the individual must be a member of the ship's crew
for longer than a single voyage.My conclusion also comports with the clear purpose of the
Jones Act and of the other maritime law remedies tradition2 "Latsis's employment did expose him to the perils of the sea--in fact,
his injury was the result of such a peril in the sense that while on board
a seaman is very much reliant upon and in the care of the ship's physician.
If that physician is unqualified or engages in medical malpractice, it is just
as much a peril to the mariner on board as the killer wave, the gale or
hurricane, or other dangers of the calling." 20 F. 3d 45, 55 (CA2 1994).

ally afforded to seamen: 3 to protect maritime workers fromexposure to the perils of the sea. In Wilander, 498 U. S.,

at 354, we endorsed Chief Justice Stone's explanation of theadmiralty law's favored treatment of seamen. Chief Justice
Stone wrote:

"The liability of the vessel or owner for maintenance
and cure, regardless of their negligence, was establishedlong before our modern conception of contract. But it,

like the liability to indemnify the seaman for injuries
resulting from unseaworthiness, has been universallyrecognized as an obligation growing out of the status of

the seaman and his peculiar relationship to the vessel,and as a feature of the maritime law compensating or
offsetting the special hazards and disadvantages towhich they who go down to sea in ships are subjected.
They are exposed to the perils of the sea and all therisks of unseaworthiness, with little opportunity to
avoid those dangers or to discover and protect themselves from them or to prove who is responsible for theunseaworthiness causing the injury.

"For these reasons the seaman has been given a spe-cial status in the maritime law as the ward of the admiralty, entitled to special protection of the law not ex-tended to land employees. Justice Story said in

Reed v.
Canfield, Fed. Cas. No. 11,641, 1 Sumn. 195, 199: `Sea-men are in some sort co-adventurers upon the voyage;

and lose their wages upon casualties, which do not affect
artisans at home. They share the fate of the ship incases of shipwreck and capture. They are liable to different rules of discipline and sufferings from landsmen.The policy of the maritime law, for great, and wise, and
benevolent purposes, has built up peculiar rights, privi3 These remedies are maintenance and cure and recovery for unseaworthiness. See G. Gilmore & C. Black, Law of Admiralty, ch. VI (2d ed.

Sieracki, 328 U. S. 85, 104-105 (1946) (dissenting opin-ion) (citations omitted).

This exposure to the perils of the sea is what separates sea-men from longshoremen, who are subject to entirely different, and usually less advantageous, remedies for injuries suf-fered in the course of their employment. Chief Justice
Stone continued:

"It is for these reasons that throughout the long his-tory of the maritime law the right to maintenance and

cure, and later the right to indemnity for injuries attrib-utable to unseaworthiness, have been confined to seamen. Longshoremen and harbor workers are in a classvery different from seamen, and one not calling for the
creation of extraordinary obligations of the vessel or itsowner in their favor, more than other classes of essentially land workers. Unlike members of the crew of avessel they do not go to sea; they are not subject to the
rigid discipline of the sea; they are not prevented by lawor ship's discipline from leaving the vessel on which they
may be employed; they have the same recourse as landworkers to avoid the hazards to which they are exposed,
to ascertain the cause of their injury and to prove it incourt."

Id., at 105.

In some cases, workers who labor on ships close to shoremay face sufficient exposure to the perils of the sea to merit

seaman status. The determination of seaman status will de-pend on the particular facts of the case. See, e. g., Desper
v. Starved Rock Ferry Co., 342 U. S. 187 (1952); 4 Senko v.

4 In Desper, we held that a workman on a moored barge was not a "seaman" at the time of his death even though "he was a probable navigator
in the near future." 342 U. S., at 191. We noted that "[t]he many cases
turning upon the question whether an individual was a `seaman' demon515us1$76I 08-25-98 19:21:32 PAGES OPINPGT

LaCrosse Dredging Corp., 352 U. S. 370 (1957); Grimes v.
Raymond Concrete Pile Co., 356 U. S. 252 (1958); Butler v.
Whiteman, 356 U. S. 271 (1958). When the extent and consequence of the employee's exposure to the seaman's hazards
is facially unclear, a test like the majority's may be appropriate. But no ambiguity exists when an employee is injured on the high seas. Unquestionably, that employee faces
the perils associated with the voyage. Incontrovertibly,
that employee is a "master or member of a crew of any vessel," within the meaning of the LHWCA, and hence a "seaman" under the Jones Act. Whatever treatment Congress
intended for employees working in proximity to the shoreline, certainly it intended to extend Jones Act protection to
the captain and crew of a ship on the high seas.

This conclusion is consistent with every Jones Act case
that this Court has decided. Justice Cardozo's opinion for
the Court in Warner v. Goltra, 293 U. S. 155 (1934), set a
course that we have consistently followed. Explaining our
holding that the master of a tugboat is a "seaman," he explained that "[i]t is enough that what he does affects `the
operation and welfare of the ship when she is upon a voyage.' " Id., at 157.5 Indeed, apart from the argument that
a seaman must assist in performing the transportation function of the vessel--an argument finally put to rest in McDermott Int'l, Inc. v. Wilander, 498 U. S. 337 (1991)--I am not
aware of a single Jones Act case decided by this Court, other

strate that the matter depends largely on the facts of the particular case
and the activity in which he was engaged at the time of injury. . . .
[T]here was no vessel engaged in navigation at the time of the decedent's
death." Id., at 190-191.

5 The quotation is from a pre-Jones Act case, The Buena Ventura, 243

F. 797, 799 (SDNY 1916). Earlier in his opinion, Justice Cardozo had
noted: "In the enforcement of the statute a policy of liberal construction
announced at the beginning has been steadily maintained." Warner, 293

than Warner,6 in which anyone even argued that an employeewho was aboard the ship contributing to the ship's mission

while the vessel was in navigation on the high seas was nota seaman. In light of the purposes of the Jones Act, that
position is simply too farfetched. As a leading admiraltytreatise has recognized, "[i]t seems never to have been questioned that any member of a ship's company who actuallygoes to sea, no matter what his (or her) duties may be, is a
seaman." G. Gilmore & C. Black, Law of Admiralty $ 6-21,p. 331 (2d ed. 1975).

Surely nothing in Wilander contradicts this basic proposi-tion. In that opinion, we made several references to the importance of work performed on a voyage. Thus, we quotedfrom leading 19th-century treatises on admiralty: " `The term
mariner includes all persons employed on board ships andvessels during the voyage to assist in their navigation and
preservation, or to promote the purposes of the voyage. . . .[A]t all times and in all countries, all the persons who have
been necessarily or properly employed in a vessel as co-laborers to the great purpose of the voyage, have, by the law,
been clothed with the legal rights of mariners.' " 498 U. S.,at 344-345 (emphasis deleted), quoting E. Benedict, American Admiralty $$ 278, 241, pp. 158, 133-134 (1850). "An 1883treatise declared: `All persons employed on a vessel to assist
in the main purpose of the voyage are mariners, and includedunder the name of seamen.' M. Cohen, Admiralty 239."
498 U. S., at 346. Summarizing our conclusion, we wrote:

"We believe the better rule is to define `master ormember of a crew' under the LHWCA, and therefore

`seaman' under the Jones Act, solely in terms of the em6 Even in Warner, no one contested the basic proposition that an employee of a ship at sea is a "seaman." Instead, the issue in that case was
whether the term "seaman" extended to the captain of such a ship, or
whether it referred only to lower level employees. The Court, applying
the "liberal construction" that Congress intended, held that the master
was a "seaman."

ployee's connection to a vessel in navigation. This rulebest explains our case law and is consistent with the

pre-Jones Act interpretation of `seaman' and Congress'land-based/sea-based distinction. All who work at sea
in the service of a ship face those particular perils towhich the protection of maritime law, statutory as well
as decisional, is directed." Id., at 354.
Our opinion in Wilander is thus entirely consistent withmy view that while a vessel is at sea every member of its

crew is a seaman within the meaning of the Jones Act.

II
Despite the language, history, and purpose of the JonesAct, the Court today holds that seaman status may require

more than a single ocean voyage. The Court's opinion thusobscures, if it does not ignore, the distinction between the
perils of the sea and the risks faced by maritime workerswhen a ship is moored to a dock. The test that the Court
formulates may be appropriate for the resolution of cases inthe latter category. The Court fails, however, to explain
why the member of the crew of a vessel at sea is not alwaysa seaman.

Respondent's argument, that "any worker who is assignedto a vessel for the duration of a voyage and whose duties
contribute to the vessel's mission must be classified as a sea-man respecting injuries incurred on that voyage," Brief for
Respondent 14, is not inconsistent with the Court's view,
ante, at 359-361, that an employee must occupy a certainstatus in order to qualify as a seaman. It merely recognizes

that all members of a ship's crew have that status while thevessel is at sea. In contrast, when the ship is in a harbor,
further inquiry may be necessary to separate land-basedfrom sea-based maritime employees. The Court is therefore
simply wrong when it states that a " `voyage test' wouldconflict with our prior understanding of the Jones Act as
fundamentally status based, granting the negligence cause

of action to those maritime workers who form the ship'scompany,"

ante, at 362. The "ship's company" is readily
identifiable when the ship is at sea; the fact that it may beless so when the ship is in port is not an acceptable reason

for refusing to rely on the voyage test in a case like this one.

The Court is also quite wrong to suggest that our priorcases "indicate that a maritime worker does not become a

`member of a crew' as soon as a vessel leaves the dock," ante,at 361. In neither of the two cases on which it relies to
support this conclusion did the injured workman even claimthe status of a seaman. In

Director, Office of Workers'
Compensation Programs v. Perini North River Associates,
459 U. S. 297 (1983), we held that an employee of a firm that
was building the foundation of a sewage treatment plant,
which extended over the Hudson River adjacent to Manhattan, was covered by the LHWCA because he was injured
while working on a barge in navigable waters. The Court
of Appeals had denied coverage on the ground that this
worker was not engaged in maritime employment. Thus,
Perini had nothing to do with any possible overlap between
the Jones Act and the LHWCA; this Court's reversal merely
found a sufficient maritime connection to support LHWCA
coverage of an admittedly shore-based worker.

The other case that the Court cites, Parker v. Motor Boat
Sales, Inc., 314 U. S. 244 (1941), involved a janitor who had
drowned while riding in a motorboat on the James River
near Richmond. The Court of Appeals had held that his
widow was not entitled to compensation under the LHWCA
on the alternative grounds (1) that the janitor was not acting
in the course of his employment when the boat capsized, and
(2) that the LHWCA did not apply because Virginia law
could provide compensation. See id., at 245. As in Perini,
our opinion reversing that decision did not discuss the Jones

7 it is not at all clear

that the Court, if asked to do so, would not have found thatthe janitor was a Jones Act seaman as well as an LHWCAcovered employee. Accordingly, the cases cited by the ma-jority lend no support to its holding that the member of a
crew of a ship at sea is not always a seaman.The Court's only other justification for refusing to apply a
voyage test is its purported concern about a worker whomight "walk into and out of coverage in the course of his
regular duties." Ante, at 363 (internal quotation marks omitted). Because the only way that a seaman could walk out of
Jones Act coverage during a voyage would be to quit his joband become a passenger (or possibly jump overboard), I take

the majority's argument to mean that a single voyage is nota long enough time to establish seaman status.

8 I simply do

not understand this argument. Surely a voyage is sufficient
time to establish an employment-related, status-based connection to a vessel in navigation that exposes the employeeto the perils of the sea. The majority cannot explain why

an employee who signs on for a single journey is any less a"seaman" or "member of a crew" if he intends to become an
insurance agent after the voyage than if he intends to remainwith the ship. What is important is the employee's status
at the time of the injury, not his status a day, a month, or ayear beforehand or afterward.

Apparently, the majority's real concern about walking in
and out of coverage is that an employer will be unable topredict which of his employees will be covered by the Jones

Act, and which by the LHWCA, on any given day. I think

7 During this period, the Court incorrectly treated stevedores working
on moored vessels as seamen covered by the Jones Act under the preLHWCA ruling in International Stevedoring Co. v. Haverty, 272 U. S. 50
(1926). See Wilander, 498 U. S., at 348-349.

8 Or at least, it is not necessarily a long enough time. It depends on

the facts. See ante, at 371-372.

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
it is a novel construction of the Jones Act to read it as ascheme to protect employers.

9 But even if Congress had

shared the Court's concern, this case does not implicate it inthe least. We are talking here about a lengthy voyage on

the high seas. The employer controls who goes on that voy-age; he knows, more or less, when that voyage will begin
and when it will end. And, but for the majority's decisiontoday, he would know that while the ship is at sea, all his
employees thereon would be covered by the Jones Act andnot by the LHWCA. Thus, no one is walking out of Jones
Act coverage and into LHWCA coverage (or vice versa)
without the employer's knowledge and control. Once again,
the majority's concern--and its method of determining sea-man status--is properly directed at injuries occurring while

the ship is at port.As a matter of history, this concern with oscillating back
and forth between different types of compensation systemsrecalls a very different and far more serious problem: the
difficulty of defining who is a "maritime employee" (a classof workers that includes both seamen and longshoremen) and
who is not. Over the powerful dissent of Justice Holmes, in
Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, 244 U. S. 205 (1917), theCourt held that the constitutional grant of admiralty and

maritime jurisdiction to the federal courts prevented theState of New York from applying its workmen's compensation statute to a longshoreman who was injured on a gangplank about 10 feet seaward of Pier 49 in New York City.
Jensen was a shore-based worker who had walked out ofthe coverage of the state law into an unprotected federal
area--the area seaward of the shoreline. In enacting the

9 The Jones Act was passed to overturn the harsh rule of The Osceola,
189 U. S. 158 (1903), which disallowed any recovery by a seaman for negligence of the master or any member of the crew of his ship under general maritime law. McDermott Int'l, Inc. v. Wilander, 498 U. S. 337, 342
(1991). The aim of the statute, then, was to expand the remedies available to employees, not to aid their employers.

LHWCA, Congress in 1927 responded to Jensen and itsprogeny by extending federal protection to shore-based

workers injured while temporarily on navigable waters.The statute excluded Jones Act seamen, on the one hand, and
shore-based workers while they were on the landward side
of the Jensen line, on the other. As we have explained onmore than one occasion, then, the LHWCA was originally a

"gap-filling" measure intended to create coverage for thoseworkers for whom, after

Jensen, States could not provide
compensation. See, e. g., Norton v. Warner Co., 321 U. S.565, 570 (1944);

Davis v. Department of Labor and Industries of Wash., 317 U. S. 249, 252-253 (1942); see also S. Rep.No. 973, 69th Cong., 1st Sess., 16 (1926).

10

Thus, the majority's concern about employees "walking inand out of coverage" evokes images of a real problem engendered by Jensen--the problem of employees changing theirlegal status, sometimes many times a day, merely by walking
from one place to another in the course of their employment.
That problem is not implicated in this case. At the time of
his injury Latsis was employed, with the full knowledge of
his employer, on a ship at sea. He could not walk out of
coverage until the voyage was over. At the end of the voyage, if Latsis had taken on other duties, wholly or partly on
land, and had been injured while so engaged, then the major10 Whereas the LHWCA as enacted in 1927 responded to the problem of
employees who walked out of state coverage every time they boarded a
ship, the 1972 amendment to that Act responded to the opposite concern--
longshoremen who walked out of federal coverage every time they left the
ship. Because state compensation schemes were sometimes less generous
than the LHWCA, Congress expanded the federal coverage to encompass
injuries occurring on piers and adjacent land used for loading and unloading ships. See H. R. Rep. No. 92-1441, pp. 10-11 (1972). Because the
class of workers protected by the LHWCA continued to be composed entirely of shore-based workers, the 1972 amendment appropriately preserved the exclusion of Jones Act seamen. It did not alter the original
1927 Act's constructive definition of "seaman" as "master or member of a
crew of any vessel."

ity's concern might have substance. But in this case, themajority's concern--and its test for seaman status--is completely misplaced. III

In my opinion every member of the crew of a vessel isentitled to the protection of the Jones Act during a voyage
on the high seas, even if he was not a part of the crew beforethe ship left port, and even if he abandoned the ship the
moment it arrived at its destination. This view is consistentwith every Jones Act case this Court has ever decided, and
it is faithful to the statutory purpose to provide special pro-tection to those who must encounter the perils of the sea
while earning their livelihood. Whether a sailor voluntarilysigns on for a single voyage, as Jim Hawkins did,

11 or, like

Billy Budd, is impressed into duty against his will,12 he issurely a seaman when his ship sails, whatever fate might

await him at the end of the voyage.

389OCTOBER TERM, 1994
Syllabus

WITTE v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fifth circuit

No. 94-6187. Argued April 17, 1995--Decided June 14, 1995
After petitioner Witte pleaded guilty to a federal marijuana charge, a

presentence report calculated the base offense level under the United
States Sentencing Guidelines by aggregating the total quantity of drugs
involved not only in Witte's offense of conviction but also in uncharged
criminal conduct in which he had engaged with several co-conspirators.
The resulting sentencing range was higher than it would have been if
only the drugs involved in his conviction had been considered, but it still
fell within the scope of the legislatively authorized penalty. The District Court accepted the report's aggregation in sentencing Witte, concluding that the other offenses were part of a continuing conspiracy that
should be taken into account under the Guidelines as "relevant conduct,"
United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual $ 1B1.3.
When Witte was subsequently indicted for conspiring and attempting
to import cocaine, he moved to dismiss the charges, arguing that he had
already been punished for the offenses because that cocaine had been
considered as "relevant conduct" at his marijuana sentencing. The
court dismissed the indictment on grounds that punishment for the cocaine offenses would violate the Double Jeopardy Clause's prohibition
against multiple punishments, but the Court of Appeals reversed. Relying on this Court's decision in Williams v. Oklahoma, 358 U. S. 576
(1959), it held that the use of relevant conduct to increase the punishment for a charged offense does not punish the offender for the relevant conduct.

Held: Because consideration of relevant conduct in determining a defendant's sentence within the legislatively authorized punishment range does
not constitute punishment for that conduct within the meaning of the
Double Jeopardy Clause, Witte's prosecution on cocaine charges does
not violate the prohibition against multiple punishments. Pp. 395-406.

(a) This Court's precedents make clear that a defendant in Witte's
situation is only punished, for double jeopardy purposes, for the offense
of conviction. Traditionally, a sentencing judge may conduct a broad
inquiry, largely unlimited either as to the kind of information he may
consider or the source from which it may come. Against this background of sentencing history, the Court, in Williams, supra, specifically
rejected the claim that double jeopardy principles bar a later prosecu515us1$77z 08-11-98 21:55:34 PAGES OPINPGT
390 WITTE v. UNITED STATES

Syllabus
tion or punishment for criminal activity where that activity has been
considered at sentencing for a separate crime. Williams governs this
case, for it makes no difference in this context whether the enhancement
occurred in the first or second proceeding. Here, as in Williams, the
uncharged criminal conduct was used to enhance Witte's sentence
within the range authorized by statute. Pp. 395-400.

(b) Other decisions of this Court reinforce the conclusion reached
here. In repeatedly upholding recidivism statutes, the Court has rejected double jeopardy challenges because enhanced punishment imposed for a later offense is viewed as a stiffened penalty for the latest
crime, which is considered to be an aggravated offense because it is a
repetitive one. See, e. g., Gryger v. Burke, 334 U. S. 728, 732. In addition, by authorizing the consideration of offender-specific information at
sentencing without the procedural protections attendant at a criminal
trial, the Court's cases necessarily imply that such consideration does
not result in "punishment" for such conduct. See, e. g., McMillan v.
Pennsylvania, 477 U. S. 79. Pp. 400-401.

(c) Contrary to Witte's suggestion, the Guidelines do not somehow
change the constitutional analysis. A defendant has not been "punished" any more for double jeopardy purposes when relevant conduct is
included in the calculation of his offense level under the Guidelines than
when a pre-Guidelines court, in its discretion, took similar uncharged
conduct into account. In each case, the defendant is still being punished, for double jeopardy purposes, only for the offense of conviction.
Pp. 401-404.

(d) The Guidelines include significant safeguards to protect Witte
against having the length of his second sentence multiplied by duplicative consideration of the same criminal conduct already considered as
"relevant conduct" for the marijuana sentence. And he would be able
to vindicate his interests through appropriate appeals should the Guidelines be misapplied in any future sentencing proceeding. Even if the
Sentencing Commission had not formalized sentencing for multiple convictions, district courts retain enough flexibility under the Guidelines to
take into account the fact that conduct underlying the offense at issue
has previously been taken into account in sentencing for another offense. Pp. 404-406.

Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court.#
The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment tothe United States Constitution prohibits successive prosecution or multiple punishment for "the same offence." Thiscase, which involves application of the United States Sentencing Guidelines, asks us to consider whether a court vio-lates that proscription by convicting and sentencing a defendant for a crime when the conduct underlying that offensehas been considered in determining the defendant's sentence
for a previous conviction. I

In June 1990, petitioner Steven Kurt Witte and severalco-conspirators, including Dennis Mason and Tom Pokorny,
arranged with Roger Norman, an undercover agent of theDrug Enforcement Administration, to import large amounts
of marijuana from Mexico and cocaine from Guatemala.Norman had the task of flying the contraband into the United
States, with Witte providing the ground transportation forthe drugs once they had been brought into the country. The
following month, the Mexican marijuana source advised theconspiracy participants that cocaine might be added to the

Opinion of the Court
first shipment if there was room on the plane or if an insuffi-cient quantity of marijuana was available. Norman was informed in August 1990 that the source was prepared to de-liver 4,400 pounds of marijuana. Once Norman learned the
location of the airstrip from which the narcotics would be
transported, federal agents arranged to have the partici-pants in the scheme apprehended in Mexico. Local authorities arrested Mason and four others on August 12 and seized591 kilograms of cocaine at the landing field. While still
undercover, Norman met Witte the following day to explainthat the pilots had been unable to land in Mexico because
police had raided the airstrip. Witte was not taken into custody at that time, and the activities of the conspiracy lapsed
for several months.

Agent Norman next spoke with Witte in January 1991
and asked if Witte would be interested in purchasing 1,000
pounds of marijuana. Witte agreed, promised to obtain a
$50,000 down payment, and indicated that he would transport the marijuana in a horse trailer he had purchased for
the original 1990 transaction and in a motor home owned
by an acquaintance, Sam Kelly. On February 7, Witte, Norman, and Kelly met in Houston, Texas. Norman agreed to
give the drugs to Witte in exchange for the $25,000 in cash
Witte had been able to secure at that time and for a promise
to pay the balance of the down payment in three days. Undercover agents took the motor home and trailer away to load
the marijuana, and Witte escorted Norman to Witte's hotel
room to view the money. The agents returned the vehicles
the next morning loaded with approximately 375 pounds of
marijuana, and they arrested Witte and Kelly when the two
men took possession of the contraband.

In March 1991, a federal grand jury in the Southern
District of Texas indicted Witte and Kelly for conspiring and
attempting to possess marijuana with intent to distribute it,
in violation of 21 U. S. C. $$ 841(a) and 846. The indictment
was limited on its face to conduct occurring on or about

Opinion of the Court
January 25 through February 8, 1991, thus covering only thelater marijuana transaction. On February 21, 1992, Witte

pleaded guilty to the attempted possession count and agreedto cooperate "with the Government by providing truthful
and complete information concerning this and all other
offenses about which [he] might be questioned by agents oflaw enforcement," and by testifying if requested to do so.

App. 14. In exchange, the Government agreed to dismissthe conspiracy count and, if Witte's cooperation amounted
to "substantial assistance," to file a motion for a downwarddeparture under the Sentencing Guidelines. See United
States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual $ 5K1.1
(Nov. 1994) (USSG).

In calculating Witte's base offense level under the Sentencing Guidelines, the presentence report prepared by the
United States Probation Office considered the total quantity
of drugs involved in all of the transactions contemplated by
the conspirators, including the planned 1990 shipments of
both marijuana and cocaine. Under the Sentencing Guidelines, the sentencing range for a particular offense is determined on the basis of all "relevant conduct" in which the
defendant was engaged and not just with regard to the conduct underlying the offense of conviction. USSG $ 1B1.3.
The Sentencing Commission has noted that, "[w]ith respect
to offenses involving contraband (including controlled substances), the defendant is accountable for all quantities of
contraband with which he was directly involved and, in the
case of a jointly undertaken criminal activity, all reasonably
foreseeable quantities of contraband that were within the
scope of the criminal activity that he jointly undertook."
USSG $ 1B1.3, comment., n. 2; see also USSG $ 2D1.1, comment., nn. 6, 12. The presentence report therefore suggested that Witte was accountable for the 1,000 pounds of
marijuana involved in the attempted possession offense to
which he pleaded guilty, 15 tons of marijuana that Witte,
Mason, and Pokorny had planned to import from Mexico in

Opinion of the Court
1990, 500 kilograms of cocaine that the conspirators origi-nally proposed to import from Guatemala, and the 591 kilograms of cocaine seized at the Mexican airstrip in August1990.

At the sentencing hearing, both petitioner and the Government urged the court to hold that the 1990 activities concern-ing importation of cocaine and marijuana were not part of

the same course of conduct as the 1991 marijuana offense towhich Witte had pleaded guilty, and therefore should not be
considered in sentencing for the 1991 offense. The DistrictCourt concluded, however, that because the 1990 importation
offenses were part of the same continuing conspiracy, they
were "relevant conduct" under $ 1B1.3 of the Guidelines and
should be taken into account. The court therefore accepted
the presentence report's aggregation of the quantities of
drugs involved in the 1990 and 1991 episodes, resulting in a
base offense level of 40, with a Guideline range of 292 to 365
months' imprisonment. App. 80-81; see also USSG $ 2D1.1.
From that base offense level, Witte received a two-level increase for his aggravating role in the offense, see USSG

$ 3B1.1, and an offsetting two-level decrease for acceptance
of responsibility, see USSG $ 3E1.1. Finally, the court
granted the Government's $ 5K1.1 motion for downward departure based on Witte's substantial assistance. By virtue
of that departure, the court sentenced Witte to 144 months
in prison, see App. 76, which was 148 months below the minimum sentence of 292 months under the predeparture Guideline range. Witte appealed, but the Court of Appeals dismissed the case when Witte failed to file a brief.

In September 1992, another grand jury in the same district
returned a two-count indictment against Witte and Pokorny
for conspiring and attempting to import cocaine, in violation
of 21 U. S. C. $$ 952(a) and 963. The indictment alleged that,
between August 1989 and August 1990, Witte tried to import
about 1,091 kilograms of cocaine from Central America.
Witte moved to dismiss, arguing that he had already been

Opinion of the Court
punished for the cocaine offenses because the cocaine in-volved in the 1990 transactions had been considered as "relevant conduct" at sentencing for the 1991 marijuana offense.The District Court dismissed the indictment in February
1993 on grounds that punishment for the indicted offenseswould violate the prohibition against multiple punishments
contained in the Double Jeopardy Clause of the FifthAmendment. App. 130-136.

The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed. 25F. 3d 250 (1994). Relying on our decision in

Williams v.Oklahoma, 358 U. S. 576 (1959), the court held that "the use

of relevant conduct to increase the punishment of a chargedoffense does not punish the offender for the relevant conduct." 25 F. 3d, at 258. Thus, although the sentencingcourt took the quantity of cocaine involved in the 1990 importation scheme into account when determining the sentencefor Witte's 1991 marijuana possession offense, the Court of
Appeals concluded that Witte had not been punished for thecocaine offenses in the first prosecution--and that the Double
Jeopardy Clause therefore did not bar the later action. Inreaching this result, the court expressly disagreed with contrary holdings in United States v. Koonce, 945 F. 2d 1145(CA10 1991), cert. denied, 503 U. S. 994 (1992), and United
States v. McCormick, 992 F. 2d 437 (CA2 1993), that when adefendant's actions are included in relevant conduct in determining the punishment under the Sentencing Guidelines forone offense, those actions may not form the basis for a later
indictment without violating double jeopardy. We grantedcertiorari to resolve the conflict among the Circuits, 513 U. S.
1072 (1995), and now affirm.

II
The Double Jeopardy Clause provides: "[N]or shall anyperson be subject for the same offence to be twice put in

jeopardy of life or limb." U. S. Const., Amdt. 5. We haveexplained that "the Clause serves the function of preventing

both successive punishment and successive prosecution,"
United States v. Dixon, 509 U. S. 688, 704 (1993) (citing North
Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U. S. 711 (1969)), and that "the Constitution was designed as much to prevent the criminal from
being twice punished for the same offence as from being
twice tried for it," Ex parte Lange, 18 Wall. 163, 173 (1874).
See also Schiro v. Farley, 510 U. S. 222, 229-230 (1994);
United States v. Halper, 490 U. S. 435, 440, 451, n. 10 (1989).
Significantly, the language of the Double Jeopardy Clause
protects against more than the actual imposition of two punishments for the same offense; by its terms, it protects a
criminal defendant from being twice put in jeopardy for such
punishment. See Price v. Georgia, 398 U. S. 323, 326 (1970).
That is, the Double Jeopardy Clause "prohibits merely punishing twice, or attempting a second time to punish criminally, for the same offense." Helvering v. Mitchell, 303
U. S. 391, 399 (1938) (emphasis added).

Petitioner clearly was neither prosecuted for nor convicted
of the cocaine offenses during the first criminal proceeding.
The offense to which petitioner pleaded guilty and for which
he was sentenced in 1992 was attempted possession of marijuana with intent to distribute it, whereas the crimes
charged in the instant indictment are conspiracy to import
cocaine and attempted importation of the same. Under
Blockburger v. United States, 284 U. S. 299, 304 (1932),
"where the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of
two distinct statutory provisions, the test to be applied to
determine whether there are two offenses or only one, is
whether each provision requires proof of a fact which the
other does not." See also Dixon, supra, at 696 (emphasizing
that the same inquiry generally applies "[i]n both the multiple punishment and multiple prosecution contexts"). Under
the Blockburger test, the indictment in this case did not
charge the same offense to which petitioner formerly had
pleaded guilty.

Opinion of the Court
Petitioner nevertheless argues that, because the conductgiving rise to the cocaine charges

was taken into account
during sentencing for the marijuana conviction, he effec-tively was "punished" for that conduct during the first proceeding. As a result, he contends, the Double Jeopardy
Clause bars the instant prosecution. This claim is ripe atthis stage of the prosecution--although petitioner has not

yet been convicted of the cocaine offenses--because, as wehave said, "courts may not impose more than one punishment
for the same offense and prosecutors ordinarily may not at-tempt to secure that punishment in more than one trial."
Brown v. Ohio, 432 U. S. 161, 165 (1977). See also Ball v.
United States, 470 U. S. 856, 861, 864-865 (1985) (explaining
that, for purposes of the double jeopardy inquiry, punishment
"must be the equivalent of a criminal conviction and not simply the imposition of sentence"); Ex parte Lange, supra, at
173. Thus, if petitioner is correct that the present case constitutes a second attempt to punish him criminally for the
same cocaine offenses, see Helvering, supra, at 399, then the
prosecution may not proceed. We agree with the Court of
Appeals, however, that petitioner's double jeopardy theory--
that consideration of uncharged conduct in arriving at a sentence within the statutorily authorized punishment range
constitutes "punishment" for that conduct--is not supported
by our precedents, which make clear that a defendant in that
situation is punished, for double jeopardy purposes, only for
the offense of which the defendant is convicted.

Traditionally, "[s]entencing courts have not only taken into
consideration a defendant's prior convictions, but have also
considered a defendant's past criminal behavior, even if no
conviction resulted from that behavior." Nichols v. United
States, 511 U. S. 738, 747 (1994). We explained in Williams
v. New York, 337 U. S. 241, 246 (1949), that "both before and
since the American colonies became a nation, courts in this
country and in England practiced a policy under which a sentencing judge could exercise a wide discretion in the sources

398 WITTE v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
and types of evidence used to assist him in determining thekind and extent of punishment to be imposed within limits

fixed by law." That history, combined with a recognition ofthe need for individualized sentencing, led us to conclude
that the Due Process Clause did not require "that courts
throughout the Nation abandon their age-old practice ofseeking information from out-of-court sources to guide their

judgment toward a more enlightened and just sentence."
Id., at 250-251. Thus, "[a]s a general proposition, a sentencing judge `may appropriately conduct an inquiry broad inscope, largely unlimited either as to the kind of information

he may consider, or the source from which it may come.' "
Nichols, supra, at 747 (quoting United States v. Tucker, 404
U. S. 443, 446 (1972)). See also Wisconsin v. Mitchell, 508
U. S. 476, 485 (1993).

Against this background of sentencing history, we specifically have rejected the claim that double jeopardy principles
bar a later prosecution or punishment for criminal activity
where that activity has been considered at sentencing for a
separate crime. Williams v. Oklahoma, 358 U. S., at 576,
arose out of a kidnaping and murder committed by the petitioner while attempting to escape from police after a robbery. Following his arrest, Williams pleaded guilty to murder and was given a life sentence. He was later convicted
of kidnaping, which was then a capital offense in Oklahoma,
and the sentencing court took into account, in assessing the
death penalty, the fact that the kidnaping victim had been
murdered. We rejected Williams' contention that this use
of the conduct that had given rise to the prior conviction
violated double jeopardy. Emphasizing that "the exercise
of a sound discretion in such a case required consideration of
all the circumstances of the crime," we made clear that "one
of the aggravating circumstances involved in this kidnaping

Opinion of the Court
cumstance, along with all the other circumstances involved,in determining the proper sentence to be imposed for the

kidnaping crime." Id., at 585-586. We then disposed of thepetitioner's double jeopardy claim as follows: "[I]n view of
the obvious fact that, under the law of Oklahoma, kidnaping
is a separate crime, entirely distinct from the crime of mur-der, the court's consideration of the murder as a circumstance involved in the kidnaping crime cannot be said to haveresulted in punishing petitioner a second time for the same
offense . . . ." Id., at 586. We thus made clear that use ofevidence of related criminal conduct to enhance a defendant's
sentence for a separate crime within the authorized statutory limits does not constitute punishment for that conduct
within the meaning of the Double Jeopardy Clause.

We find this case to be governed by Williams; it makes no
difference in this context whether the enhancement occurred
in the first or second sentencing proceeding. Here, petitioner pleaded guilty to attempted possession of marijuana
with intent to distribute it, in violation of 21 U. S. C. $$ 841(a)
and 846. The statute provides that the sentence for such a
crime involving 100 kilograms or more of marijuana must
be between 5 and 40 years in prison. $ 841(b)(1)(B). By including the cocaine from the earlier transaction--and not
just the marijuana involved in the offense of conviction--in
the drug quantity calculation, the District Court ended up
with a higher offense level (40), and a higher sentence range
(292 to 365 months), than it would have otherwise under the
applicable Guideline, which specifies different base offense
levels depending on the quantity of drugs involved. USSG

$ 2D1.1. This higher Guideline range, however, still falls
within the scope of the legislatively authorized penalty (5 to
40 years). As in Williams, the uncharged criminal conduct
was used to enhance petitioner's sentence within the range
authorized by statute. If use of the murder to justify the
death sentence for the kidnaping conviction was not "punishment" for the murder in Williams, it is impossible to con515us1$77J 08-11-98 21:55:34 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
clude that taking account of petitioner's plans to import co-caine in fixing the sentence for the marijuana conviction

constituted "punishment" for the cocaine offenses.

Williams, like this case, concerned the double jeopardy
implications of taking the circumstances surrounding a particular course of criminal activity into account in sentencingfor a conviction arising therefrom. Similarly, we have made

clear in other cases, which involved a defendant's backgroundmore generally and not conduct arising out of the same criminal transaction as the offense of which the defendant wasconvicted, that "[e]nhancement statutes, whether in the nature of criminal history provisions such as those contained
in the Sentencing Guidelines, or recidivist statutes which are
common place in state criminal laws, do not change the penalty imposed for the earlier conviction." Nichols, 511 U. S.,
at 747 (approving consideration of a defendant's previous
uncounseled misdemeanor conviction in sentencing him for
a subsequent offense). In repeatedly upholding such recidivism statutes, we have rejected double jeopardy challenges
because the enhanced punishment imposed for the later offense "is not to be viewed as either a new jeopardy or additional penalty for the earlier crimes," but instead as "a stiffened penalty for the latest crime, which is considered to be
an aggravated offense because a repetitive one." Gryger v.
Burke, 334 U. S. 728, 732 (1948). See also Spencer v. Texas,
385 U. S. 554, 560 (1967); Oyler v. Boles, 368 U. S. 448, 451
(1962); Moore v. Missouri, 159 U. S. 673, 677 (1895) (under a
recidivist statute, "the accused is not again punished for the
first offence" because " `the punishment is for the last offence
committed, and it is rendered more severe in consequence of
the situation into which the party had previously brought
himself ' ").

In addition, by authorizing the consideration of offenderspecific information at sentencing without the procedural
protections attendant at a criminal trial, our cases necessarily imply that such consideration does not result in "punish515us1$77J 08-11-98 21:55:34 PAGES OPINPGT

401Cite as: 515 U. S. 389 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
ment" for such conduct. In McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477U. S. 79 (1986), we upheld against a due process challenge

Pennsylvania's Mandatory Minimum Sentencing Act, whichimposed a 5-year minimum sentence for certain enumerated
felonies if the sentencing judge found, by a preponderance of
the evidence, that the defendant "visibly possessed a fire-arm" during the commission of the offense. Significantly,

we emphasized that the statute at issue "neither alters themaximum penalty for the crime committed nor creates a separate offense calling for a separate penalty; it operates solelyto limit the sentencing court's discretion in selecting a penalty within the range already available to it without the special finding of visible possession of a firearm." Id., at 87-88.
That is, the statute "simply took one factor that has always
been considered by sentencing courts to bear on punishment--the instrumentality used in committing a violent felony--and dictated the precise weight to be given that factor
if the instrumentality is a firearm." Id., at 89-90. For this
reason, we approved the lesser standard of proof provided
for in the statute, thereby "reject[ing] the claim that whenever a State links the `severity of punishment' to `the presence or absence of an identified fact' the State must prove
that fact beyond a reasonable doubt." Id., at 84 (quoting
Patterson v. New York, 432 U. S. 197, 214 (1977)). These
decisions reinforce our conclusion that consideration of information about the defendant's character and conduct at
sentencing does not result in "punishment" for any offense
other than the one of which the defendant was convicted.

We are not persuaded by petitioner's suggestion that the
Sentencing Guidelines somehow change the constitutional
analysis. A defendant has not been "punished" any more
for double jeopardy purposes when relevant conduct is included in the calculation of his offense level under the Guidelines than when a pre-Guidelines court, in its discretion, took
similar uncharged conduct into account. Cf. McMillan,
supra, at 92 (perceiving no difference in the due process cal515us1$77J 08-11-98 21:55:34 PAGES OPINPGT
402 WITTE v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
culus depending upon whether consideration of the sentenc-ing factor was discretionary or mandatory). As the Government argues, "[t]he fact that the sentencing process hasbecome more transparent under the Guidelines . . . does not
mean that the defendant is now being `punished' for uncharged relevant conduct as though it were a distinct crimi-nal `offense.' " Brief for United States 23. The relevant

conduct provisions are designed to channel the sentencingdiscretion of the district courts and to make mandatory the
consideration of factors that previously would have been op-tional.

United States v. Wright, 873 F. 2d 437, 441 (CA1
1989) (Breyer, J.) (explaining that, "very roughly speaking,
[relevant conduct] corresponds to those actions and circumstances that courts typically took into account when sentencing prior to the Guidelines' enactment"). See also Burns v.
United States, 501 U. S. 129, 133 (1991); Mistretta v. United
States, 488 U. S. 361, 363-367 (1989). Regardless of whether
particular conduct is taken into account by rule or as an act
of discretion, the defendant is still being punished only for
the offense of conviction.

Justice Stevens disagrees with our conclusion because,
he contends, "[u]nder the Guidelines, . . . an offense that is
included as `relevant conduct' does not relate to the character
of the offender (which is reflected instead by criminal history), but rather measures only the character of the offense."
Post, at 411. The criminal history section of the Guidelines,
however, does not seem to create this bright line distinction;
indeed, the difference between "criminal history" and "relevant conduct" is more temporal than qualitative, with the
former referring simply to a defendant's past criminal conduct (as evidenced by convictions and prison terms), see
USSG $ 4A1.1, and the latter covering activity arising out of
the same course of criminal conduct as the instant offense,
see USSG $ 1B1.3.

To the extent that the Guidelines aggravate punishment
for related conduct outside the elements of the crime on the

515us1$77J 08-11-98 21:55:34 PAGES OPINPGT

403Cite as: 515 U. S. 389 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
theory that such conduct bears on the "character of the of-fense," the offender is still punished only for the fact that the

present offense was carried out in a manner that warrantsincreased punishment, not for a

different offense (which that
related conduct may or may not constitute). But, while relevant conduct thus may relate to the severity of the particu-lar crime, the commission of multiple offenses in the same

course of conduct also necessarily provides important evi-dence that the character of the offender requires special punishment. Similarly, as we have said in the recidivism cases,a crime committed by an offender with a prior conviction "is
considered to be an aggravated offense because a repetitive
one." Gryger, 334 U. S., at 732. Nothing about the labels
given to these categories controls the use to which such
information is put at sentencing. Under the Guidelines,
therefore, as under the traditional sentencing regimes Justice Stevens approves, "it is difficult if not impossible to
determine whether a given offense has affected the judge's
assessment of the character of the offender, the character of
the offense, or both." Post, at 411 (Stevens, J., dissenting).
Even under Justice Stevens' framework, the structure of
the Guidelines should not affect the outcome of this case.

The relevant conduct provisions of the Sentencing Guidelines, like their criminal history counterparts and the recidivism statutes discussed above, are sentencing enhancement
regimes evincing the judgment that a particular offense
should receive a more serious sentence within the authorized
range if it was either accompanied by or preceded by additional criminal activity. Petitioner does not argue that the
range fixed by Congress is so broad, and the enhancing role
played by the relevant conduct so significant, that consideration of that conduct in sentencing has become "a tail which
wags the dog of the substantive offense." McMillan, 477
U. S., at 88; cf. Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U. S. 684, 700 (1975).
We hold that, where the legislature has authorized such a
particular punishment range for a given crime, the resulting

515us1$77J 08-11-98 21:55:34 PAGES OPINPGT
404 WITTE v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
sentence within that range constitutes punishment only forthe offense of conviction for purposes of the double jeopardy

inquiry. Accordingly, the instant prosecution for the cocaineoffenses is not barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause as a
second attempt to punish petitioner for the same crime.

III
At its core, much of petitioner's argument addresses not aclaim that the instant cocaine prosecution violates principles

of double jeopardy, but the more modest contention that heshould not receive a second sentence under the Guidelines
for the cocaine activities that were considered as relevantconduct for the marijuana sentence. As an examination of
the pertinent sections should make clear, however, theGuidelines take into account the potential unfairness with
which petitioner is concerned.Petitioner argues that the Sentencing Guidelines require
that drug offenders be sentenced in a single proceeding forall related offenses, whether charged or uncharged. See
Brief for Petitioner 20-23. Yet while the Guidelines cer-tainly envision that sentences for multiple offenses arising
out of the same criminal activity ordinarily will be imposedtogether, they also explicitly contemplate the possibility of
separate prosecutions involving the same or overlapping"relevant conduct." See USSG $ 5G1.3, comment., n. 2 (addressing cases in which "a defendant is prosecuted in . . . twoor more federal jurisdictions, for the same criminal conduct
or for different criminal transactions that were part of thesame course of conduct"). There are often valid reasons
why related crimes committed by the same defendant arenot prosecuted in the same proceeding, and $ 5G1.3 of the
Guidelines attempts to achieve some coordination of sen-tences imposed in such situations with an eye toward having such punishments approximate the total penalty thatwould have been imposed had the sentences for the different offenses been imposed at the same time (i. e., had all

405Cite as: 515 U. S. 389 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
of the offenses been prosecuted in a single proceeding). SeeUSSG $ 5G1.3, comment., n. 3.

Because the concept of relevant conduct under the Guide-lines is reciprocal, $ 5G1.3 operates to mitigate the possibility
that the fortuity of two separate prosecutions will grossly
increase a defendant's sentence. If a defendant is servingan undischarged term of imprisonment "result[ing] from offense(s) that have been fully taken into account [as relevantconduct] in the determination of the offense level for the instant offense," $ 5G1.3(b) provides that "the sentence for theinstant offense shall be imposed to run concurrently to the
undischarged term of imprisonment." And where $ 5G1.3(b)
does not apply, an accompanying policy statement provides,
"the sentence for the instant offense shall be imposed to run
consecutively to the prior undischarged term of imprisonment to the extent necessary to achieve a reasonable
incremental punishment for the instant offense." USSG

$ 5G1.3(c) (policy statement). Significant safeguards built
into the Sentencing Guidelines therefore protect petitioner
against having the length of his sentence multiplied by duplicative consideration of the same criminal conduct; he would
be able to vindicate his interests through appropriate appeals should the Guidelines be misapplied in any future
sentencing proceeding.

Even if the Sentencing Commission had not formalized
sentencing for multiple convictions in this way, district
courts under the Guidelines retain enough flexibility in appropriate cases to take into account the fact that conduct
underlying the offense at issue has previously been taken
into account in sentencing for another offense. As the Commission has explained, "[u]nder 18 U. S. C. $ 3553(b) the sentencing court may impose a sentence outside the range established by the applicable guideline, if the court finds `that
there exists an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a
kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration
by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines

that should result in a sentence different from that de-scribed.' " USSG $ 5K2.0 (policy statement). This departure power is also available to protect against petitioner'ssecond major practical concern: that a second sentence for
the same relevant conduct may deprive him of the effect ofthe downward departure under $ 5K1.1 of the Guidelines for
substantial assistance to the Government, which reduced hisfirst sentence significantly. Should petitioner be convicted
of the cocaine charges, he will be free to put his argumentconcerning the unusual facts of this case to the sentencing
judge as a basis for discretionary downward departure.

IV
Because consideration of relevant conduct in determininga defendant's sentence within the legislatively authorized

punishment range does not constitute punishment for thatconduct, the instant prosecution does not violate the Double
Jeopardy Clause's prohibition against the imposition of mul-tiple punishments for the same offense. Accordingly, the
judgment of the Court of Appeals is

Affirmed.

Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Thomas joins,concurring in the judgment.

This is one of those areas in which I believe our jurispru-dence is not only wrong but unworkable as well, and so persist in my refusal to give that jurisprudence stare decisiseffect. See

subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy oflife or limb," U. S. Const., Amdt. 5 (emphasis added), which

means twice prosecuted for the same offense. Today's deci-sion shows that departing from the text of the Clause, and
from the constant tradition regarding its meaning, as we didsix years ago in

United States v. Halper, 490 U. S. 435 (1989),requires us either to upset well-established penal practices,

or else to perceive lines that do not really exist. Havingcreated a right against multiple punishments ex nihilo, we
now allow that right to be destroyed by the technique usedon the petitioner here: "We do not punish you twice for the
same offense," says the Government, "but we punish you
twice as much for one offense solely because you also com-mitted another offense, for which other offense we will also

punish you (only once) later on." I see no real difference inthat distinction, and decline to acquiesce in the erroneous
holding that drives us to it.In sum, I adhere to my view that "the Double Jeopardy
Clause prohibits successive prosecution, not successivepunishment."

Scalia, J., dissenting).
Since petitioner was not twice prosecuted for the sameoffense, I concur in the judgment.

Justice Stevens, concurring in part and dissenting in
part.

Petitioner pleaded guilty to attempting to possess with intent to distribute more than 100 kilograms of marijuana. Atpetitioner's sentencing hearing, the District Court heard evidence concerning petitioner's participation in a conspiracy to
import cocaine. Pursuant to its understanding of the UnitedStates Sentencing Guidelines, the District Court considered

the cocaine offenses as "relevant conduct" and increased peti-tioner's sentence accordingly. Petitioner received exactly
the same sentence that he would have received had he beenconvicted of both the marijuana offenses and the cocaine of515us1$77I 08-11-98 21:55:34 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of Stevens, J.
fenses. The Government then sought to prosecute peti-tioner for the cocaine offenses.

The question presented is whether the Double JeopardyClause bars that subsequent prosecution. The Court today
holds that it does not. In my view, the Court's holding isincorrect and unprecedented. More importantly, it weakens
the fundamental protections the Double Jeopardy Clausewas intended to provide.

I
In my view, the double jeopardy violation is plain. Peti-tioner's marijuana conviction, which involved 1,000 pounds

of marijuana, would have resulted in a Guidelines range of78 to 97 months. When petitioner's cocaine offenses were
considered in the sentencing calculus, the new Guidelinesrange was 292 to 365 months. This was the range that the
District Court used as the basis for its sentencing calcula-tions.

1 Thus, the District Court's consideration of the cocaine offenses increased petitioner's sentencing range byover 200 months.

Under these facts, it is hard to see how the Double Jeopardy Clause is not implicated. In my view, quite simply,petitioner was put in jeopardy of punishment for the cocaine

transactions when, as mandated by the Guidelines, he wasin fact punished for those offenses. The Double Jeopardy
Clause should thus preclude any subsequent prosecution forthose cocaine offenses.

II
Despite the intuitive appeal of this approach, the majority
concludes that these facts do not implicate the Double Jeop-ardy Clause. To reach this conclusion, the majority relies

1 After making offsetting adjustments for an aggravating role in the
offense and for acceptance of responsibility, the District Court, pursuant
to United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual $ 5K1.1, departed downward by 148 months and sentenced petitioner to 144 months'
imprisonment.

on our prior decisions that have permitted sentencers to con-sider at sentencing both prior convictions and other offenses

that are related to the offense of conviction. The majority'sreliance on these cases suggests that it has overlooked a distinction that I find critical to the resolution of the double
jeopardy issue at hand."Traditionally, sentencing judges have considered a wide

variety of factors in addition to evidence bearing on guilt indetermining what sentence to impose on a convicted defendant." Wisconsin v. Mitchell, 508 U. S. 476, 485 (1993)."One such important factor" to be considered in the sentencing calculus is "a defendant's prior convictions." Nichols
v. United States, 511 U. S. 738, 747 (1994). Indeed, the
prominent role played by past conduct in most guidelinesbased sentencing regimes and in statutes that punish more
harshly "habitual offenders" reveals the importance of this
factor. As the majority notes, we have repeatedly upheld
the use of such prior convictions against double jeopardy
challenges. See ante, at 400 (citing cases). However, an
understanding of the reason for our rejection of those
challenges makes clear that those cases do not support the
majority's conclusion.

Traditional sentencing practices recognize that a just sentence is determined in part by the character of the offense
and in part by the character of the offender. Within this
framework, the admission of evidence of an offender's past
convictions reflects the longstanding notion that one's prior
record is strong evidence of one's character. A recidivist
should be punished more severely than a first offender because he has failed to mend his ways after a first conviction.
As we noted in Moore v. Missouri, 159 U. S. 673, 677 (1895),
" `the punishment for the second [offense] is increased, because by his persistence in the perpetration of crime, [the
defendant] has evinced a depravity, which merits a greater
punishment, and needs to be restrained by severer penalties
than if it were his first offence.' " See also McDonald v.

515us1$77I 08-11-98 21:55:34 PAGES OPINPGT
410 WITTE v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of Stevens, J.
Massachusetts, 180 U. S. 311, 313 (1901) (commission of a sec-ond crime after conviction for first "show[s] that the man

is an habitual criminal"). Thus, when a sentencing judgereviews an offender's prior convictions at sentencing, the
judge is not punishing that offender a second time for his
past misconduct, but rather is evaluating the nature of hisindividual responsibility for past acts and the likelihood that

he will engage in future misconduct. Recidivist statutes areconsistent with the Double Jeopardy Clause not because of
the formalistic premise that one can only be punished orplaced in jeopardy for the "offense of conviction," but rather
because of the important functional understanding that the
purpose of the prior conviction is to provide valuable evidence as to the offender's character. The majority's reliance
on recidivist statutes is thus unavailing.

When the offenses considered at sentencing are somehow
linked to the offense of conviction, the analysis is different.
Offenses that are linked to the offense of conviction may affect both the character of the offense and the character of
the offender. That is, even if he is not a recidivist, a person
who commits two offenses should also be punished more severely than one who commits only one, in part because the
commission of multiple offenses provides important evidence
that the character of the offender requires special punishment, and in part because the character of the offense is aggravated by the commission of multiple offenses. Insofar as
a sentencer relies on an offense as evidence of character, the
Double Jeopardy Clause is not implicated. However, insofar
as the sentencer relies on the offense as aggravation of the
underlying offense, the Double Jeopardy Clause is necessarily implicated. At that point, the defendant is being punished for having committed the offense at issue, and not for
what the commission of that offense reveals about his character. In such cases, the defendant has been "put in jeopardy"
of punishment for the offense because he has in fact been
punished for that offense.

Opinion of Stevens, J.
Under many sentencing regimes, of course, it is difficultif not impossible to determine whether a given offense has

affected the judge's assessment of the character of theoffender, the character of the offense, or both. However,
under the federal Sentencing Guidelines, the role played by
each item in the sentencing calculus is perfectly clear. TheGuidelines provide for specific sentencing adjustments for

"criminal history" (i. e., character of the offender) and for"relevant conduct" (

i. e., character of the offense). Under
the Guidelines, therefore, an offense that is included as "rele-vant conduct" does not relate to the character of the offender

(which is reflected instead by criminal history), but rather
measures only the character of the offense. Even if all other
mitigating and aggravating circumstances that shed light on
an offender's character have been taken into account, the
judge must sentence the offender for conduct that affects the
seriousness of the offense.

The effect of this regime with respect to drug crimes provides a particularly striking illustration of why this mandatory consideration of relevant conduct implicates the Double
Jeopardy Clause under anything but a formalistic reading of
the Clause. Under the Guidelines, the severity of a drug
offense is measured by the total quantity of drugs under all
offenses that constitute "relevant conduct," regardless of
whether those offenses were charged and proved at the guilt
phase of the trial or instead proved at the sentencing hearing. For example, as I have noted above, petitioner's Guidelines range was determined by adding the quantity of marijuana to the quantity of cocaine (using the conversion
formula set forth in the Guidelines). Petitioner has thus already been sentenced for an actual offense that includes the
cocaine transactions that are the subject of the second indictment. Those transactions played precisely the same role in
fixing his punishment as they would have if they had been
the subject of a formal charge and conviction. The actual
imposition of that punishment must surely demonstrate that

412 WITTE v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of Stevens, J.
petitioner was just as much in jeopardy for the offense as if
he had been previously charged with it.

In sum, traditional sentencing practice does not offend the
Double Jeopardy Clause because (1) past convictions are
used only as evidence of the character of the offender, and
not as evidence of the character of the offense, and (2) in
traditional sentencing regimes, it is impossible to determine
for what purpose the sentencer has relied on the relevant
offenses. In my view, the Court's failure to recognize the
critical distinction between the character of the offender and
the character of the offense, as well as the Court's failure to
recognize the change in sentencing practices caused by the
Guidelines, cause it to overlook an important and obvious
violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause.

III
Once this error in the majority's analysis is recognized, it
becomes apparent that none of the cases on which the majority relies compels today's novel holding. In Williams v. New
York, 337 U. S. 241 (1949), the Court held that the Due Process Clause did not prevent a sentencing judge from considering information contained in a presentence report. The
Court's conclusion in Williams is consistent with my approach. The Williams Court repeatedly emphasized that
the information in the presentence report provided the court
with relevant information about the character of the defendant. For example, the Court noted that "the New York statutes emphasize a prevalent modern philosophy of penology
that the punishment should fit the offender and not merely
the crime." The Court continued: "The belief no longer prevails that every offense in a like legal category calls for an
identical punishment without regard to the past life and habits of a particular offender." Finally, the Court observed
that "[t]oday's philosophy of individualizing sentences makes
sharp distinctions for example between first and repeated

Opinion of Stevens, J.
offenders." Id., at 247-248. Thus, the entire rationale ofthe

Williams opinion focused on the importance of evidence
that reveals the character of the offender. Not a word inJustice Black's opinion even suggests that if evidence adduced at sentencing were used to support a sentence for an
offense more serious than the offense of conviction, the de-fendant would not have been placed in jeopardy for that

more serious offense.2The Court also relies on

McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477
U. S. 79 (1986), suggesting that McMillan "necessarily im-pl[ies]" that consideration of "offender-specific information at

sentencing" does not "result in `punishment for such con-duct.' "

Ante, at 400-401. I believed at the time and continue to believe that McMillan was wrongly decided. How-ever, even accepting the Court's conclusion in

McMillan,
that case does not support the majority's position. In
United States v. Halper, 490 U. S. 435, 448 (1989), and Department of Revenue of Mont. v. Kurth Ranch, 511 U. S.
767, 779-780 (1994), we emphatically rejected the proposition
that punishment under the Double Jeopardy Clause only occurs when a court imposes a sentence for an offense that is
proven beyond a reasonable doubt at a criminal trial.

The case on which the Court places its principal reliance,
Williams v. Oklahoma, 358 U. S. 576 (1959), is not controlling precedent. Williams was decided over 10 years before
the Court held in Benton v. Maryland, 395 U. S. 784 (1969),
that the Double Jeopardy Clause "should apply to the States
through the Fourteenth Amendment." Id., at 794. Thus,
Williams did not even apply the Double Jeopardy Clause

2 The majority's reliance on Nichols v. United States, 511 U. S. 738
(1994), is similarly unavailing. In Nichols, the Court permitted the inclusion of an uncounseled misdemeanor conviction in the calculation of a defendant's criminal history. However, as I have noted above, the inclusion
of an offense in criminal history for sentencing purposes treats that offense as relevant to the character of the offender rather than to the character of the offense.

and instead applied only a "watered-down" version of dueprocess, see Benton, 395 U. S., at 796. Moreover, in Williams, the State's discretionary sentencing scheme was en-tirely dissimilar to the federal Sentencing Guidelines, which
require that "relevant conduct" be punished as if it had beenproved beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court is therefore
free to accept or reject the majority's reasoning in Williams.The precise issue resolved in

Williams is also somewhatdifferent from that presented in today's case. In Williams,

the petitioner committed two offenses, kidnaping and mur-der, arising out of the same incident. Though petitioner was
convicted of capital murder, the judge imposed a sentence oflife imprisonment. There is no reason to believe that the
judge considered the kidnaping offense as relevant conductin sentencing petitioner for the murder. Williams was then
prosecuted for kidnaping. He did not raise a double jeop-ardy objection to the kidnaping prosecution--an objection
that would have been comparable to petitioner's claim in thiscase regarding his cocaine prosecution. After Williams
pleaded guilty to the kidnaping, the court considered the cir-cumstances of the crime, including the murder, and imposed
a death sentence. This Court affirmed. I agree with Jus-tice Douglas' dissent that "petitioner was in substance tried
for murder twice in violation of the guarantee against doublejeopardy." 358 U. S., at 587. In any event, I surely would
not apply the Williams Court's dubious reasoning to a fed-eral sentence imposed under the Guidelines.

3

3 I recognize that the Court in Williams stated that "the court's consideration of the murder as a circumstance involved in the kidnapping crime
cannot be said to have resulted in punishing petitioner a second time for
the same offense." 358 U. S., at 586. As I note in the text, I disagree
with this statement. But even if it were correct, it does not dispose of
petitioner's claim that he is being prosecuted for the cocaine offense a
second time. The statement in Williams is directed only at the use of a
prior conviction in a subsequent sentencing proceeding; it does not address
whether the second prosecution is barred by the fact that the defendant
has already been punished for the offense to be prosecuted.

Opinion of Stevens, J.
Given the absence of precedent requiring the majority's
unjust result, the case should be decided by giving effect to
the text and purpose of the Double Jeopardy Clause. Petitioner received the sentence authorized by law for the offense of attempting to import cocaine. Petitioner is now
being placed in jeopardy of a second punishment for the same
offense. Requiring him to stand trial for that offense is a
manifest violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause.

IV
Though the majority's holding in Parts I and II removes
the Double Jeopardy Clause as a constitutional bar to petitioner's second punishment, the majority does recognize that
the provisions of the Sentencing Guidelines reduce the likelihood of a second punishment as a practical matter. The
Guidelines will generally ensure that the total sentence received in the two proceedings is the same sentence that
would have been received had both offenses been brought in
the same proceeding. Moreover, as the majority notes, the
departure power is available to protect against unwarranted
double punishment, see ante, at 405-406, as well as to prevent any possibility that "a second sentence for the same
relevant conduct may deprive [a defendant] of the effect of
the downward departure under $ 5K1.1 of the Guidelines for
substantial assistance to the Government," ante, at 406.4

The Court's statutory holding thus mitigates some of the
otherwise unfortunate results of its constitutional approach.
More importantly, the Court's statutory analysis is obviously
correct. Accordingly, I join Part III of the Court's opinion.

4 Of course, the safeguards in the Guidelines do not eliminate the double
jeopardy violation. The Double Jeopardy Clause protects against the
burdens incident to a second trial, and not just against the imposition of a
second punishment. Moreover, a "second conviction, even if it results in
no greater sentence, is an impermissible punishment." Ball v. United
States, 470 U. S. 856, 865 (1985).

In my view, the Double Jeopardy Clause precludes peti-tioner's subsequent prosecution for the cocaine offenses because petitioner was placed in jeopardy when he was pun-ished for those offenses following his conviction for the
marijuana offenses. I therefore join only Part III of theCourt's opinion, and I respectfully dissent from the Court's
judgment.

GUTIERREZ de MARTINEZ et al. v.LAMAGNO

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fourth circuit

No. 94-167. Argued March 22, 1995--Decided June 14, 1995
Invoking the federal court's jurisdiction based on diversity of citizenship,

petitioners alleged in their complaint that they had suffered physical
injuries and property damage as a result of an accident in Colombia
caused by the negligence of respondent Lamagno, a federal employee.
The United States Attorney, acting pursuant to the statute commonly
known as the Westfall Act, 28 U. S. C. $ 2679(d)(1), certified on behalf of
the Attorney General that Lamagno was acting within the scope of his
employment at the time of the episode. Ordinarily, upon such certification, the employee is dismissed from the action, the United States is
substituted as defendant, and the case proceeds under the Federal Tort
Claims Act (FTCA). But in this case, substitution would cause the
action's demise: petitioners' claims arose abroad, and thus fell within
an exception to the FTCA's waiver of the United States' sovereign immunity. And the United States' immunity would afford petitioners no
legal ground to bring Lamagno back into the action. See United States
v. Smith, 499 U. S. 160. Endeavoring to redeem their lawsuit, petitioners sought court review of the Attorney General's scope-of-employment
certification, for if Lamagno was acting outside the scope of his employment, the action could proceed against him. However, the District
Court held the certification unreviewable, substituted the United States
for Lamagno, and dismissed the suit. The Fourth Circuit affirmed.

Held: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.
23 F. 3d 402, reversed and remanded.

Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court with respect
to Parts I, II, and III, concluding that the Attorney General's scope-ofemployment certification is reviewable in court. Pp. 423-434.

(a) As shown by the division in the lower courts and in this case, the
Westfall Act is open to divergent interpretation on the question at issue.
Two considerations weigh heavily in the Court's analysis. First, the
Attorney General herself urges review, mindful that in cases of the kind
petitioners present, the incentive of her delegate to certify is marked.
Second, when a Government official's determination of a fact or circumstance--for example, "scope of employment"--is dispositive of a court
controversy, federal judges traditionally proceed from the strong pre515us2$78z 08-25-98 19:23:41 PAGES OPINPGT

Syllabus
sumption that Congress intends judicial review. Review will not be cut
off absent persuasive reason to believe that Congress so intended. No
such reason is discernible here. Pp. 423-425.

(b) Congress, when it composed the Westfall Act, legislated against a
backdrop of judicial review: courts routinely reviewed the local United
States Attorney's scope-of-employment certification under the Act's
statutory predecessor. The plain purpose of the Westfall Act was to
override Westfall v. Erwin, 484 U. S. 292, which had added a "discretionary function" requirement, discrete from the scope-of-employment test,
as a criterion for a federal officer's personal immunity. Although Congress thus wanted the employee's personal immunity to turn solely on
the critical scope-of-employment inquiry, nothing tied to the Act's purpose shows an intent to commit that inquiry to the unreviewable judgment of the Attorney General or her delegate. Pp. 425-426.

(c) Construction of the Westfall Act as Lamagno urges--to deny to
federal courts authority to review the Attorney General's scope-ofemployment certification--would oblige this Court to attribute to Congress two highly anomalous commands. First, the Court would have
to accept that, whenever the case falls within an exception to the FTCA,
Congress has authorized the Attorney General to sit as an unreviewable
judge in her own cause--able to block petitioners' way to a tort action
in court, at no cost to the federal treasury, while avoiding litigation in
which the United States has no incentive to engage, and incidentally
enhancing the morale--or at least sparing the purse--of federal employees. This conspicuously self-serving interpretation runs counter to the
fundamental principle that no one should be a judge in his own cause,
and has been disavowed by the United States. Pp. 426-429.

(d) Second, and at least equally perplexing, Lamagno's proposed reading would cast Article III judges in the role of petty functionaries, persons required to rubber-stamp the decision of a scarcely disinterested
executive officer, but stripped of capacity to evaluate independently
whether that decision is correct. This strange course becomes all the
more surreal when one adds to the scene the absence of any obligation
on the part of the Attorney General's delegate to conduct proceedings,
to give the plaintiff an opportunity to speak to the scope-of-employment
question, to give notice that she is considering the question, or to give
any explanation for her action. This Court resists ascribing to Congress an intention to place courts in the untenable position of having
automatically to enter judgments pursuant to decisions they have no
authority to evaluate. Pp. 429-430.

(e) The Westfall Act's language is far from clear. Section 2679(d)(2)
provides for removal of the case from state to federal court and for
substitution of the United States as defendant upon the Attorney Gener515us2$78z 08-25-98 19:23:41 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
al's certification. Section 2679(d)(2) states explicitly that "certification
of the Attorney General shall conclusively establish scope of office or
employment for purposes of removal." (Emphasis added.) Notably,

$ 2679(d)(2) contains no such statement with regard to substitution.
The $ 2679(d)(2) prescription thus tends in favor of judicial review.
Counseling against review, however, is the commanding force of the
word "shall": "Upon certification by the Attorney General . . . , any civil
action or proceeding . . . shall be deemed an action against the United
States . . . , and the United States shall be substituted as the party
defendant." $ 2679(d)(1) (emphasis added). As the statutory language
is reasonably susceptible to divergent interpretations, the Court adopts
the reading that accords with the presumption favoring judicial review
and the tradition of court review of scope certifications, while avoiding
the anomalies that attend foreclosure of review. Pp. 430-434.

Ginsburg, J., delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts
I, II, and III, in which Stevens, O'Connor, Kennedy, and Breyer, JJ.,

Opinion of the Court
Compensation Act of 1988 (commonly known as the WestfallAct) empowers the Attorney General to certify that the employee "was acting within the scope of his office or employ-ment at the time of the incident out of which the claim arose
. . . ." 28 U. S. C. $ 2679(d)(1). Upon certification, the em-ployee is dismissed from the action and the United States
is substituted as defendant. The case then falls under thegovernance of the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), ch. 753,
60 Stat. 812, 842. Generally, such cases unfold much as casesdo against other employers who concede

respondeat superiorliability. If, however, an exception to the FTCA shields the

United States from suit, the plaintiff may be left without atort action against any party.

This case is illustrative. The Attorney General certifiedthat an allegedly negligent employee "was acting within the
scope of his . . . employment" at the time of the episode insuit. Once brought into the case as a defendant, however,
the United States asserted immunity, because the incidentgiving rise to the claim occurred abroad and the FTCA excepts "[a]ny claim arising in a foreign country." 28 U. S. C.$ 2680(k). Endeavoring to redeem their lawsuit, plaintiffs
(petitioners here) sought court review of the Attorney Gen-eral's scope-of-employment certification, for if the employee
was acting outside the scope of his employment, the plain-tiffs' tort action could proceed against him. The lower
courts held the certification unreviewable. We reverse thatdetermination and hold that the scope-of-employment certification is reviewable in court.

I
Shortly before midnight on January 18, 1991, in Barran-quilla, Colombia, a car driven by respondent Dirk A. Lamagno, a special agent of the United States Drug Enforce-ment Administration (DEA), collided with petitioners' car.
Petitioners, who are citizens of Colombia, allege that La515us2$78P 08-25-98 19:23:41 PAGES OPINPGT

magno was intoxicated and that his passenger, an unidenti-fied woman, was not a federal employee.

Informed that diplomatic immunity shielded Lamagnofrom suit in Colombia, petitioners filed a diversity action
against him in the United States District Court for the East-ern District of Virginia, the district where Lamagno resided.
Alleging that Lamagno's negligent driving caused the acci-dent, petitioners sought compensation for physical injuries
and property damage.1 In response, the local United StatesAttorney, acting pursuant to the Westfall Act, certified on
behalf of the Attorney General that Lamagno was actingwithin the scope of his employment at the time of the accident. The certification, as is customary, stated no reasonsfor the U. S. Attorney's scope-of-employment determination.

In the Westfall Act, Congress instructed:

"Upon certification by the Attorney General that thedefendant employee was acting within the scope of his

office or employment at the time of the incident out ofwhich the claim arose, any civil action or proceeding

1 Petitioners also filed an administrative claim with the DEA pursuant
to 84 Stat. 1284, as amended, 21 U. S. C. $ 904, which authorizes settlement
of tort claims that "arise in a foreign country in connection with the operations of the [DEA] abroad." The DEA referred the claim to the Department of Justice, which has not yet made a final administrative decision on
that claim. As read by the Fourth Circuit, $ 904 contains no express or
implied provision for judicial review. App. 15.

2 The certification read:

"I, Richard Cullen, United States Attorney for the Eastern District of
Virginia, acting pursuant to the provisions of 28 U. S. C. $ 2679, and by
virtue of the authority vested in me by the Appendix to 28 C.F.R. $ 15.3
(1991), hereby certify that I have investigated the circumstances of the
incident upon which the plaintiff[s'] claim is based. On the basis of the
information now available with respect to the allegations of the complaint,
I hereby certify that defendant Dirk A. Lamagno was acting within the
scope of his employment as an employee of the United States of America
at the time of the incident giving rise to the above entitled action."

Opinion of the Court
commenced upon such claim in a United States districtcourt shall be deemed an action against the United

States under the provisions of this title and all refer-ences thereto, and the United States shall be substituted
as the party defendant." $ 2679(d)(1).
Thus, absent judicial review and court rejection of the certi-fication, Lamagno would be released from the litigation; furthermore, he could not again be pursued in any damagesaction arising from the "same subject matter." $ 2679(b)(1).
Replacing Lamagno, the United States would become soledefendant.

Ordinarily, scope-of-employment certifications occasion nocontest. While the certification relieves the employee of responsibility, plaintiffs will confront instead a financially reli-able defendant. But in this case, substitution of the United
States would cause the demise of the action: Petitioners'claims "ar[ose] in a foreign country," FTCA, 28 U. S. C.

$ 2680(k), and thus fell within an exception to the FTCA'swaiver of the United States' sovereign immunity. See

$ 2679(d)(4) (upon certification, the action "shall proceed inthe same manner as any action against the United States . . .
and shall be subject to the limitations and exceptions appli-cable to those actions"). Nor would the immunity of the
United States allow petitioners to bring Lamagno back intothe action. See United States v. Smith, 499 U. S. 160 (1991).

To keep their action against Lamagno alive, and to avoidthe fatal consequences of unrecallable substitution of the
United States as the party defendant, petitioners asked theDistrict Court to review the certification. Petitioners maintained that Lamagno was acting outside the scope of hisemployment at the time of the accident; certification to the
contrary, they argued, was groundless and untrustworthy.Following Circuit precedent,

Johnson v. Carter, 983 F. 2d1316 (CA4) (en banc), cert. denied, 510 U. S. 812 (1993), the

District Court held the certification unreviewable, substi-tuted the United States for Lamagno, and dismissed peti515us2$78P 08-25-98 19:23:41 PAGES OPINPGT

The Circuits divide sharply on this issue. Parting fromthe Fourth Circuit, most of the Courts of Appeals have held
certification by the Attorney General or her delegate amena-ble to court review.

We encounter in this case the familiar questions: where isthe line to be drawn; and who decides. Congress has firmly

answered the first question. "Scope of employment" setsthe line. See $ 2679(b)(1);

United States v. Smith, 499 U. S.160 (1991). If Lamagno is inside that line, he is not subject to petitioners' suit; if he is outside the line, he is person-ally answerable. The sole question, then, is who decides
on which side of the line the case falls: the local United

Opinion of the Court
States Attorney, unreviewably or, when that official's deci-sion is contested, the court. Congress did not address this

precise issue unambiguously, if at all. As the division in thelower courts and in this Court shows, the Westfall Act is, on
the "who decides" question we confront, open to divergentinterpretation.

Two considerations weigh heavily in our analysis, andwe state them at the outset. First, the Attorney General
herself urges review, mindful that in cases of the kind peti-tioners present, the incentive of her delegate to certify is
marked. Second, when a Government official's determina-tion of a fact or circumstance--for example, "scope of employment"--is dispositive of a court controversy, federalcourts generally do not hold the determination unreviewable.
Instead, federal judges traditionally proceed from the"strong presumption that Congress intends judicial review."
Bowen v. Michigan Academy of Family Physicians, 476U. S. 667, 670 (1986); see id., at 670-673; Abbott Laboratories
v. Gardner, 387 U. S. 136, 140 (1967). Chief Justice Marshalllong ago captured the essential idea:

"It would excite some surprise if, in a government oflaws and of principle, furnished with a department
whose appropriate duty it is to decide questions of right,not only between individuals, but between the government and individuals; a ministerial officer might, at hisdiscretion, issue this powerful process . . . leaving to [the
claimant] no remedy, no appeal to the laws of his country,if he should believe the claim to be unjust. But this
anomaly does not exist; this imputation cannot be caston the legislature of the United States." United States
v. Nourse, 9 Pet. 8, 28-29 (1835).
Accordingly, we have stated time and again that judicialreview of executive action "will not be cut off unless there

is persuasive reason to believe that such was the purposeof Congress."

Abbott Laboratories, 387 U. S., at 140 (citing

Opinion of the Court
cases). No persuasive reason for restricting access to judi-cial review is discernible from the statutory fog we confront here. B

Congress, when it composed the Westfall Act, legislatedagainst a backdrop of judicial review. Courts routinely
reviewed the local United States Attorney's scope-of-employment certification under the Westfall Act's statutory
predecessor, the Federal Drivers Act, Pub. L. 87-258, $ 1, 75Stat. 539 (previously codified as 28 U. S. C. $ 2679(d) (1982
ed.)). Similar to the Westfall Act but narrower in scope, theDrivers Act made the FTCA the exclusive remedy for motor
vehicle accidents involving federal employees acting withinthe scope of their employment. 75 Stat. 539 (previously codified at 28 U. S. C. $ 2679(b) (1982 ed.)). The Drivers Act,like the Westfall Act, had a certification scheme, though it
applied only to cases brought in state court. Once the At-torney General or his delegate certified that the defendant
driver was acting within the scope of employment, the casewas removed to federal court and the United States was substituted as defendant. But the removal and substitutionwere subject to the federal court's control; a court determination that the driver was acting outside the scope of hisemployment would restore the case to its original status.
See, e. g., McGowan v. Williams, 623 F. 2d 1239, 1242 (CA7
1980); Seiden v. United States, 537 F. 2d 867, 870 (CA6 1976);
Levin v. Taylor, 464 F. 2d 770, 771 (CADC 1972).

When Congress wrote the Westfall Act, which covers fed-eral employees generally and not just federal drivers, the

legislators had one purpose firmly in mind. That purposesurely was not to make the Attorney General's delegate the
final arbiter of "scope-of-employment" contests. Instead,
Congress sought to override Westfall v. Erwin, 484 U. S. 292(1988). In

Westfall, we held that, to gain immunity from
suit for a common-law tort, a federal employee would have

Opinion of the Court
to show (1) that he was acting within the scope of his employ-ment, and (2) that he was performing a discretionary function. Id., at 299. Congress reacted quickly to delete the"discretionary function" requirement, finding it an unwarranted judicial imposition, one that had "created an immedi-ate crisis involving the prospect of personal liability and the
threat of protracted personal tort litigation for the entireFederal workforce." $ 2(a)(5), 102 Stat. 4563.

The Westfall Act trained on this objective: to "return Fed-eral employees to the status they held prior to the

Westfalldecision." H. R. Rep. No. 100-700, p. 4 (1988). Congress

was notably concerned with the significance of the scope-of-employment inquiry--that is, it wanted the employee's personal immunity to turn on that question alone. See $ 2(b),102 Stat. 4564 (purpose of Westfall Act is to "protect Federal
employees from personal liability for common law torts com-mitted within the scope of their employment"). But nothing
tied to the purpose of the legislation shows that Congressmeant the Westfall Act to commit the critical "scope-ofemployment" inquiry to the unreviewable judgment of theAttorney General or her delegate, and thus to alter fundamentally the answer to the "who decides" question.

C
Construction of the Westfall Act as Lamagno urges--todeny to federal courts authority to review the Attorney General's scope-of-employment certification--would oblige us toattribute to Congress two highly anomalous commands.
Not only would we have to accept that Congress, by itssilence, authorized the Attorney General's delegate to make
determinations of the kind at issue without any judicialcheck. At least equally perplexing, the proposed reading
would cast Article III judges in the role of petty functionar-ies, persons required to enter as a court judgment an executive officer's decision, but stripped of capacity to evaluateindependently whether the executive's decision is correct.

Opinion of the Court

1
In the typical case, by certifying that an employee wasacting within the scope of his employment, the Attorney

General enables the tort plaintiff to maintain a claim for re-lief under the FTCA, a claim against the financially reliable
United States. In such a case, the United States, by certify-ing, is acting

against its financial interest, exposing itselfto liability as would any other employer at common law

who admits that an employee acted within the scope of hisemployment. See Restatement (Second) of Agency $ 219
(1958).The situation alters radically, however, in the unusual
case--like the one before us--that involves an exception tothe FTCA.

5 When the United States retains immunity from

suit, certification disarms plaintiffs. They may not proceedagainst the United States, nor may they pursue the employee

shielded by the certification. Smith, 499 U. S., at 166-167.In such a case, the certification surely does not qualify as
a declaration against the Government's interest: it does notexpose the United States to liability, and it shields a federal
employee from liability.But that is not all. The impetus to certify becomes overwhelming in a case like this one, as the Attorney General, insiding with petitioners, no doubt comprehends. If the local

428 GUTIERREZ de MARTINEZ v. LAMAGNO

Opinion of the Court
United States Attorney, to whom the Attorney General hasdelegated responsibility, refuses certification, the employee

can make a federal case of the matter by alleging a wrongfulfailure to certify. See $ 2679(d)(3). The federal employee's
claim is one the United States Attorney has no incentive tooppose for the very reason the dissent suggests, see

post, at448-449: Win or lose, the United States retains its immunity;

hence, were the United States to litigate "scope of employ-ment" against its own employee--thereby consuming the
local United States Attorney's precious litigation resources--it would be litigating solely for the benefit of the plaintiff.
Inevitably, the United States Attorney will feel a strong tugto certify, even when the merits are cloudy, and thereby "do
a favor," post, at 448, both for the employee and for theUnited States as well, at a cost borne solely, and perhaps
quite unfairly, by the plaintiff.The argument for unreviewability in such an instance
runs up against a mainstay of our system of government.Madison spoke precisely to the point:

"No man is allowed to be a judge in his own cause,because his interest would certainly bias his judgment,
and, not improbably, corrupt his integrity. With equal,nay with greater reason, a body of men are unfit to be
both judges and parties at the same time . . . ." TheFederalist No. 10, p. 79 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961).

See In re Murchison, 349 U. S. 133, 136 (1955) ("[O]ur systemof law has always endeavored to prevent even the probability
of unfairness. To this end no man can be a judge in his owncase and no man is permitted to try cases where he has an
interest in the outcome."); Spencer v. Lapsley, 20 How. 264,266 (1858) (recognizing statute accords with this maxim); see
also Publius Syrus, Moral Sayings 51 (D. Lyman transl. 1856)("No one should be judge in his own cause."); B. Pascal,

Opinion of the Court
judge in his own cause."); 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries*91 ("[I]t is unreasonable that any man should determine his

own quarrel.").In sum, under Lamagno's reading of the congressional
product at issue, whenever the case falls within an exceptionto the FTCA, the Attorney General sits as an unreviewable
"judge in her own cause"; she can block petitioners' way toa tort action in court, at no cost to the federal treasury, while
avoiding litigation in which the United States has no incen-tive to engage, and incidentally enhancing the morale--or at
least sparing the purse--of federal employees. The UnitedStates, as we have noted, disavows this extraordinary, conspicuously self-serving interpretation. See supra, at 424,and n. 4. Recognizing that a United States Attorney, in
cases of this order, is hardly positioned to act impartially, theAttorney General reads the law to allow judicial review.

2
If Congress made the Attorney General's delegate solejudge, despite the apparent conflict of interest, then Congress correspondingly assigned to the federal court onlyrubber-stamp work. Upon certification in a case such as
this one, the United States would automatically become thedefendant and, just as automatically, the case would be dismissed. The key question presented--scope of employment--however contestable in fact, would receive no judicialaudience. The court could do no more, and no less, than

convert the executive's scarcely disinterested decision into acourt judgment. This strange course becomes all the more
surreal when one adds to the scene the absence of an obliga-tion on the part of the Attorney General's delegate to conduct a fair proceeding, indeed, any proceeding. She need
not give the plaintiff an opportunity to speak to the "scope"question, or even notice that she is considering the question.

Nor need she give any explanation for her action.

Opinion of the Court
Congress may be free to establish a compensation schemethat operates without court participation. Cf. 21 U. S. C.

$ 904 (authorizing executive settlement of tort claims that"arise in a foreign country in connection with the operations
of the [DEA] abroad"). But that is a matter quite differentfrom instructing a court automatically to enter a judgment
pursuant to a decision the court has no authority to evaluate.Cf.

United States v. Klein, 13 Wall. 128, 146 (1872) (Congressmay not "prescribe rules of decision to the Judicial Department of the government in cases pending before it"). Weresist ascribing to Congress an intention to place courts in
this untenable position.6 III

We return now, in more detail, to the statutory languageto determine whether it overcomes the presumption favoring
judicial review, the tradition of court review of scope certifi-cations, and the anomalies attending foreclosure of review.

The certification, removal, and substitution provisions ofthe Westfall Act, 28 U. S. C. $$ 2679(d)(1)-(3),

7 work together

6 To the reality of an executive decisionmaker with scant incentive to
act impartially, and a court used to rubber-stamp that decisionmaker's
judgment, the dissent can only reply that these are "rare cases." Post,
at 447. But this dispute centers solely on cases fitting the description
"rare." See supra, at 422. It is hardly an answer to say that, in other
cases, indeed in the great bulk of cases, court offices are not misused.

7 Section 2679(d) provides in pertinent part:

"(1) Upon certification by the Attorney General that the defendant employee was acting within the scope of his office or employment at the time
of the incident out of which the claim arose, any civil action or proceeding
commenced upon such claim in a United States district court shall be
deemed an action against the United States under the provisions of this
title and all references thereto, and the United States shall be substituted
as the party defendant.

"(2) Upon certification by the Attorney General that the defendant employee was acting within the scope of his office or employment at the time
of the incident out of which the claim arose, any civil action or proceeding
commenced upon such claim in a State court shall be removed without
bond at any time before trial by the Attorney General to the district court

Opinion of the Court
to assure that, when scope of employment is in controversy,that matter, key to the application of the FTCA, may be

resolved in federal court. To that end, the Act specificallyallows employees whose certification requests have been denied by the Attorney General, to contest the denial in court.$ 2679(d)(3). If the action was initiated by the tort plaintiff
in state court, the Attorney General, on the defendant-employee's petition, is to enter the case and may remove it
to the federal court so that the scope determination can bemade in the federal forum.

Ibid.When the Attorney General has granted certification, if

the case is already in federal court (as is this case, becauseof the parties' diverse citizenship), the United States will
be substituted as the party defendant. $ 2679(d)(1). Ifthe case was initiated by the tort plaintiff in state court,

of the United States for the district and division embracing the place in
which the action or proceeding is pending. Such action or proceeding
shall be deemed to be an action or proceeding brought against the United
States under the provisions of this title and all references thereto, and the
United States shall be substituted as the party defendant. This certification of the Attorney General shall conclusively establish scope of office or
employment for purposes of removal.

"(3) In the event that the Attorney General has refused to certify scope
of office or employment under this section, the employee may at any time
before trial petition the court to find and certify that the employee was
acting within the scope of his office or employment. Upon such certification by the court, such action or proceeding shall be deemed to be an
action or proceeding brought against the United States under the provisions of this title and all references thereto, and the United States shall
be substituted as the party defendant. A copy of the petition shall be
served upon the United States in accordance with the provisions of Rule
4(d)(4) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. In the event the petition
is filed in a civil action or proceeding pending in a State court, the action
or proceeding may be removed without bond by the Attorney General to
the district court of the United States for the district and division embracing the place in which it is pending. If, in considering the petition, the
district court determines that the employee was not acting within the
scope of his office or employment, the action or proceeding shall be remanded to the State court."

432 GUTIERREZ de MARTINEZ v. LAMAGNO

Opinion of the Court
the Attorney General is to remove it to the federal court,where, as in a case that originated in the federal forum, the

United States will be substituted as the party defendant.$ 2679(d)(2).

The statute next instructs that the "certification of theAttorney General shall conclusively establish scope of office
or employment for purposes of removal." Ibid. (emphasisadded). The meaning of that instruction, in the view of petitioners and the Attorney General, is just what the empha-sized words import. Congress spoke in discrete sentences
in $ 2679(d)(2) first of removal, then of substitution. Next,Congress made the Attorney General's certificate conclusive
solely for purposes of removal, and notably not for purposesof substitution. It follows, petitioners and the Attorney
General conclude, that the scope-of-employment judgmentdeterminative of substitution can and properly should be
checked by the court, i. e., the Attorney General's scarcelydisinterested certification on that matter is by statute made
the first, but not the final word.Lamagno's construction does not draw on the "certification
. . . shall [be conclusive] . . . for purposes of removal" lan-guage of $ 2679(d)(2).

8 Instead, Lamagno emphasizes the

word "shall" in the statement: "Upon certification by the At-torney General . . . any civil action or proceeding . . . shall

be deemed an action against the United States . . . , and theUnited States shall be substituted as the party defendant."

$ 2679(d)(1) (emphasis added). Any doubt as to the com-manding force of the word "shall,"

9 Lamagno urges, is dis8 In fact, under Lamagno's construction, this provision has no work to
do, because Congress would have had no cause to insulate removal from
challenge. If certification cannot be overturned, as Lamagno urges, then
a firm basis for federal jurisdiction is ever present--the United States is
a party, and the FTCA governs the case.

9 Though "shall" generally means "must," legal writers sometimes use,

or misuse, "shall" to mean "should," "will," or even "may." See D. Mellinkoff, Mellinkoff's Dictionary of American Legal Usage 402-403 (1992)

Opinion of the Court
pelled by this further feature: the Westfall Act's predecessor,
the Federal Drivers Act, provided for court review of
"scope-of-employment" certifications at the tort plaintiff 's
behest. Not only does the Westfall Act fail to provide for
certification challenges by tort plaintiffs,10 Lamagno underscores, but the Act prominently provides for court review of

ing depends on context); B. Garner, Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage
939 (2d ed. 1995) ("[C]ourts in virtually every English-speaking jurisdiction have held--by necessity--that shall means may in some contexts,
and vice versa."). For example, certain of the Federal Rules use the word
"shall" to authorize, but not to require, judicial action. See, e. g., Fed.
Rule Civ. Proc. 16(e) ("The order following a final pretrial conference shall
be modified only to prevent manifest injustice.") (emphasis added); Fed.
Rule Crim. Proc. 11(b) (A nolo contendere plea "shall be accepted by the
court only after due consideration of the views of the parties and the
interest of the public in the effective administration of justice.") (emphasis added).

10 The dissent argues that Congress must have meant to foreclose judicial review of substitution when it omitted from the Westfall Act the Drivers Act language authorizing such review. See post, at 439-440, 443.
But this language likely was omitted for another reason. It appeared in
the Drivers Act provision authorizing the return of removed cases to state
court: "Should a United States district court determine on a hearing on a
motion to remand held before a trial on the merits that the case so removed is one in which a remedy by suit . . . is not available against the
United States, the case shall be remanded to the State court." 75 Stat.
539 (previously codified at 28 U. S. C. $ 2679(d) (1982 ed.)). Congress
likely omitted this provision, the thrust of which was to authorize remands, because it had decided to foreclose needless shuttling of a case
from one court to another--a decision evident also in the Westfall Act
language making certification "conclusiv[e] . . . for purposes of removal."
See $ 2679(d)(2). The omission thus tells us little about Congress' will
concerning review of substitution.

The dissent, moreover, draws inconsistent inferences from congressional
silence. Omission of language authorizing review of substitution, the dissent argues, forecloses review. See post, at 439-440, 443. But omission
of language authorizing review of removal is not sufficient to foreclose
review; rather, to achieve this purpose, the dissent says, Congress took
the further step of adding language in $ 2679(d)(2) making review "conclusiv[e] . . . for purposes of removal." See post, at 444-445.

refusals to certify at the behest of defending employees.See $ 2679(d)(3). Congress, in Lamagno's view, thus plainly

intended the one-sided review, i. e., a court check at the callof the defending employee, but no check at the tort plaintiff 's call.We recognize that both sides have tendered plausible constructions of a text most interpreters have found far fromclear. See,

e. g., McHugh v. University of Vermont, 966F. 2d 67, 72 (CA2 1992) ("[T]he text of the Westfall Act,

viewed as a whole, is ambiguous."); Arbour v. Jenkins, 903F. 2d 416, 421 (CA6 1990) ("[T]he scope certification provisions of the Westfall Act as a whole . . . [are] ambiguousregarding the reviewability of the Attorney General's scope
certification."). Indeed, the United States initially took theposition that the local United States Attorney's scope-ofemployment certifications are conclusive and unreviewablebut, on further consideration, changed its position. See
Brief for United States 14, n. 4. Because the statute is rea-sonably susceptible to divergent interpretation, we adopt the
reading that accords with traditional understandings andbasic principles: that executive determinations generally are
subject to judicial review and that mechanical judgments arenot the kind federal courts are set up to render. Under our
reading, the Attorney General's certification that a federalemployee was acting within the scope of his employment--a
certification the executive official, in cases of the kind atissue, has a compelling interest to grant--does not conclusively establish as correct the substitution of the UnitedStates as defendant in place of the employee.

IV
Treating the Attorney General's certification as conclusivefor purposes of removal but not for purposes of substitution,

amicus ultimately argues, "raise[s] a potentially serious Ar-ticle III problem." Brief for Michael K. Kellogg as

AmicusCuriae 29. If the certification is rejected, because the fed515us2$78P 08-25-98 19:23:41 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of Ginsburg, J.
eral court concludes that the employee acted outside thescope of his employment, and if the tort plaintiff and the

employee resubstituted as defendant are not of diverse citi-zenship,

amicus urges, then the federal court will be left
with a case without a federal question to support the court's
subject-matter jurisdiction. This last-pressed argument by
amicus largely drives the dissent. See post, at 440-443.

This case itself, we note, presents not even the specter ofan Article III problem. The case was initially instituted in

federal court; it was not removed from a state court. Theparties' diverse citizenship gave petitioners an entirely secure basis for filing in federal court.

In any event, we do not think the Article III problem amicus describes is a grave one. There may no longer be a federal question once the federal employee is resubstituted as
defendant, but in the category of cases amicus hypothesizes,
there was a nonfrivolous federal question, certified by the
local United States Attorney, when the case was removed
to federal court. At that time, the United States was the
defendant, and the action was thus under the FTCA.
Whether the employee was acting within the scope of his
federal employment is a significant federal question--and the
Westfall Act was designed to assure that this question could
be aired in a federal forum. See supra, at 430-432. Because a case under the Westfall Act thus "raises [a] questio[n]
of substantive federal law at the very outset," it "clearly
`arises under' federal law, as that term is used in Art. III."
Verlinden B. V. v. Central Bank of Nigeria, 461 U. S. 480,
493 (1983).

In adjudicating the scope-of-federal-employment question
"at the very outset," the court inevitably will confront facts
relevant to the alleged misconduct, matters that bear on the
state tort claims against the employee. Cf. Mine Workers
v. Gibbs, 383 U. S. 715, 725 (1966) (approving exercise of
pendent jurisdiction when federal and state claims have "a
common nucleus of operative fact" and would "ordinarily be

expected to [be tried] all in one judicial proceeding"). "[C]onsiderations of judicial economy, convenience and fairness to
litigants," id., at 726, make it reasonable and proper for the
federal forum to proceed beyond the federal question to final
judgment once it has invested time and resources on the
initial scope-of-employment contest.11

If, in preserving judicial review of scope-of-employment
certifications, Congress "approach[ed] the limit" of federalcourt jurisdiction, see post, at 441--and we do not believe it
did--we find the exercise of federal-court authority involved
here less ominous than the consequences of declaring certifications of the kind at issue uncontestable: The local United
States Attorney, whose conflict of interest is apparent, would
be authorized to make final and binding decisions insulating
both the United States and federal employees like Lamagno
from liability while depriving plaintiffs of potentially meritorious tort claims. The Attorney General, having weighed
the competing considerations, does not read the statute to
confer on her such extraordinary authority. Nor should we
assume that Congress meant federal courts to accept cases
only to stamp them "Dismissed" on an interested executive
official's unchallengeable representation. The statute is
fairly construed to allow petitioners to present to the Dis11 The dissent charges that for Congress to allow cases like this one to
open and finish in federal court, when brought there by the local United
States Attorney, "implies a jurisdictional tenacity," post, at 443, and allows
losers always to win, post, at 442. Under the dissent's abstract and unrelenting logic, it is a jurisdictional flight for Congress to assign to federal
courts tort actions in which there is a genuine issue of fact whether a
federal employee acted within the scope of his federal employment. The
dissent's solution for this discrete class of cases: plaintiffs always lose.
For the above-stated reasons, we disagree. See also Goldberg-Ambrose,
Protective Jurisdiction of the Federal Courts, 30 UCLA L. Rev. 542, 549
(1983) ("If [the legal relationships on which the plaintiff necessarily relies]
are federally created, even in small part, the claim should be treated as
one that arises under federal law within the meaning of article III, independent of any protective jurisdiction theory.").

Justice O'Connor, concurring in part and concurring inthe judgment.

For the reasons given in Parts I-III of the Court's opinion,which I join, I agree with the Court (and the Attorney General) that the Attorney General's scope-of-employment certi-fications in Westfall Act cases should be judicially reviewable. I do not join Part IV of the opinion, however. Thatdiscussion all but conclusively resolves a difficult question of
federal jurisdiction that, as Justice Ginsburg notes, is notpresented in this case.

Ante, at 435. In my view, we shouldnot resolve that question until it is necessary for us to do so.

Of course, I agree with the dissent, post, at 441, that weordinarily should construe statutes to avoid serious constitutional questions, such as that discussed in Part IV of theCourt's opinion, when it is fairly possible to do so. See
United States v. X-Citement Video, Inc., 513 U. S. 64, 78(1994);

impossible to avoid deciding that question in a future case.But even such an important canon of statutory construction

favor of judicial review of executive action, ante, at 424, theprohibition against allowing anyone " `to be a judge in his

own cause,' " ante, at 428 (quoting The Federalist No. 10,p. 79 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (J. Madison)), the peculiarity inherent in concluding that Congress has "assigned to the federal court only rubber-stamp work," ante, at 429, and the"sound general rule that Congress is deemed to avoid redundant drafting," post, at 444 (Souter, J., dissenting); ante, at432, and n. 8, point in the other direction. The highly unusual confluence of those principles in this case persuades methat, despite the fact that the dissent's reading has the virtue
of avoiding the possibility that a difficult constitutional ques-tion will arise in a future case, reversal is nonetheless the
proper course.

Justice Souter, with whom The Chief Justice,
Justice Scalia, and Justice Thomas join, dissenting.

One does not instinctively except to a statutory construction that opens the door of judicial review to an individual
who complains of a decision of the Attorney General, when
the Attorney General herself is ready to open the door. But
however much the Court and the Attorney General may
claim their reading of the Westfall Act to be within the
bounds of reasonable policy, the great weight of interpretive
evidence shows that they misread Congress's policy. And so
I respectfully dissent.

The two principal textual statements under examination
today are perfectly straightforward. "Upon certification by
the Attorney General . . . any civil action or proceeding . . .
shall be deemed an action against the United States . . . ,
and the United States shall be substituted as the party
defendant." 28 U. S. C. $ 2679(d)(1); see also $ 2679(d)(4)
("Upon certification, any action or proceeding . . . shall proceed in the same manner as any action against the United
States filed pursuant to [the FTCA] . . ."). Notwithstanding
the Court's observation that some contexts can leave the

Souter, J., dissenting
word "shall" a bit slippery, ante, at 432-433, n. 9, we have
repeatedly recognized the normally uncompromising directive that it carries. See United States v. Monsanto, 491
U. S. 600, 607 (1989); Anderson v. Yungkau, 329 U. S. 482,

485 (1947); see also Griggs v. Provident Consumer Discount
Co., 459 U. S. 56, 61 (1982) (per curiam); Association of
Civilian Technicians v. FLRA, 22 F. 3d 1150, 1153 (CADC

1994) ("The word `shall' generally indicates a command that
admits of no discretion on the part of the person instructed
to carry out the directive"); Black's Law Dictionary 1375 (6th
ed. 1990) ("As used in statutes . . . this word is generally
imperative or mandatory"). There is no hint of wobbling in
the quoted language,1 and the normal meaning of its plain
provisions that substitution is mandatory on certification is
the best evidence of the congressional intent that the Court
finds elusive (ante, at 425, 426). That normal meaning and
manifest intent is confirmed by additional textual evidence
and by its consonance with normal jurisdictional assumptions.

We would not, of course, read "shall" as so uncompromising if the Act also included some express provision for review
at the behest of the tort plaintiff when the Attorney General
certifies that the acts charged were inside the scope of a
defendant employee's official duties. But the Westfall Act
has no provision to that effect, and the very fact that its
predecessor, the Federal Drivers Act, Pub. L. 87-258, 75
Stat. 539, combined "shall" with just such authorization for
review at the will of a disappointed tort plaintiff, ibid. (previously codified at 28 U. S. C. $ 2679(d) (1982 ed.)),2 makes the

1 The Court provides two examples from the Federal Rules in which the
circumstances under which action "shall" be taken are limited by use of
the word "only." Ante, at 432-433, n. 9. There is, of course, no similar
language of limitation in $ 2679(d)(1). The only prerequisite for substitution under the Westfall Act is certification.

2 The Drivers Act provided for certification only in cases originating in

state court, and judicial review was perforce limited to those cases. See
75 Stat. 539 (previously codified at 28 U. S. C. $ 2679(d) (1982 ed.)).

absence of a like provision from the Westfall Act especiallygood evidence that Congress meant to drop this feature from

the system, leaving "shall" to carry its usual unconditionalmessage. See

Brewster v. Gage, 280 U. S. 327, 337 (1930)
("The deliberate selection of language so differing from that
used in . . . earlier Acts indicates that a change of law wasintended"); 2A N. Singer, Sutherland on Statutory Construction $ 51.02, p. 454 (4th ed. 1984). That conclusion gainsfurther force from the presence in the Westfall Act of an
express provision for judicial review at the behest of adefending employee, when the Attorney General refuses to
certify that the acts fell within the scope of Government employment. See 28 U. S. C. $ 2679(d)(3) ("[i]n the event that
the Attorney General has refused to certify scope of office or
employment under this section, the employee may at any
time before trial petition the court to find and certify that
the employee was acting within the scope of his office or
employment"). Providing authority in one circumstance but
not another implies an absence of authority in the statute's
silence. See Russello v. United States, 464 U. S. 16, 23
(1983) ("Where Congress includes particular language in one
section of a statute but omits it in another section of the
same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or
exclusion"); see also United States v. Naftalin, 441 U. S. 768,
773-774 (1979).

Even if these textually grounded implications were not
enough to confirm a plain reading of the text and decide the
case, an anomalous jurisdictional consequence of the Court's
position should be enough to warn us away from treating the
Attorney General's certification as reviewable. The Court

office or employment for purposes of removal," 28 U. S. C.$ 2679(d)(2). As the principal opinion concedes, then, ante,

at 435, its reading supposes that Congress intended federalcourts to retain jurisdiction over state-law tort claims between nondiverse parties even after determining that theAttorney General's certification (and thus the United States's
presence as the defendant) was improper. But there is aserious problem, on the Court's reasoning, in requiring a federal district court, after rejecting the Attorney General'scertification, to retain jurisdiction over a claim that does not
implicate federal law in any way. Although we have de-clined recent invitations to define the outermost limit of
federal-court jurisdiction authorized by the "Arising Under"Clause of Article III of the Constitution,

3 see Mesa v. California, 489 U. S. 121, 136-137 (1989); Verlinden B. V. v. Central Bank of Nigeria, 461 U. S. 480 (1983), on the Court'sreading this statute must at the very least approach the

limit, if it does not cross the line. This, then, is just the casefor adhering to the Court's practice of declining to construe
a statute as testing this limit when presented with a soundalternative.

Mesa v. California, supra, at 137, citing Cali-fano v. Yamasaki, 442 U. S. 682, 693 (1979).

The principal opinion departs from this practice, however.Instead, it looks for jurisdictional solace in the theory that
once the Attorney General has issued a scope-of-employmentcertification, the United States's (temporary) appearance as
the sole defendant suffices forever to support jurisdiction infederal court, even if the district court later rejects the Attorney General's certification and resubstitutes as defendantthe federal employee first sued in state court.

Ante, at 434-435. Whether the employee was within the scope of his federal employment, the principal opinion reasons, is itself a suf3 "The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties

ficient federal question to bring the case into federal court,
and " `considerations of judicial economy, convenience and
fairness to litigants,' " ante, at 436, quoting Mine Workers v.
Gibbs, 383 U. S. 715, 726 (1966), are sufficient to keep it there
even after a judicial determination that the United States is
not the proper defendant.

But the fallacy of this conclusion appears as soon as one
recalls the fact that substitution of the United States as defendant (which establishes federal-question jurisdiction) is
exclusively dependant on the scope-of-employment certification. The challenge to the certification is thus the equivalent of a challenge to the essential jurisdictional fact that the
United States is a party, and the federal court's jurisdiction
to review scope of employment (on the principal opinion's
theory) is merely an example of any court's necessary authority to rule on a challenge to its own jurisdiction to try a
particular action. To argue, as the principal opinion does,
that authority to determine scope of employment justifies
retention of jurisdiction whenever evidence bearing on jurisdiction and liability overlaps, is therefore tantamount to saying the authority to determine whether a court has jurisdiction over the cause of action supplies the very jurisdiction
that is subject to challenge. It simply obliterates the distinction between the authority to determine jurisdiction and
the jurisdiction that is the subject of the challenge, and the
party whose jurisdictional claim was challenged will never
lose: litigating the question whether an employee's allegedly
tortious acts fall within the scope of employment will, of
course, always require some evidence to show what the acts
were. Accordingly, there will always be overlap between
evidence going to the scope-of-employment determination
and evidence bearing on the underlying liability claimed by
the plaintiff, and for this reason federal-question jurisdiction
in these cases becomes inevitable on the Court's view. The
right to challenge it therefore becomes meaningless, as does

Souter, J., dissenting
the very notion of jurisdictional limitation. The Court's
cure for the jurisdictional disease is thus to kill the concept
of federal-question jurisdiction as a limit on what federal
courts may entertain.

It would never be sound to attribute such an aberrant concept of federal-question jurisdiction to Congress; it is impossible to do so when we realize that Congress expressly
provided that when a federal court considers a challenge to
the Attorney General's refusal to certify (raised by an
employee-defendant) and finds the act outside the scope of
employment, a case that originated in a state court must be
remanded back to the state court. See 28 U. S. C. $ 2679(d)
(3). In such a case, there will have been just as much overlap of jurisdictional evidence and liability evidence as there
will be when the jurisdictional issue is litigated at the behest
of a plaintiff (as here) who contests a scope-of-employment
certification. If Congress thought the federal court should
retain jurisdiction when it is revealed that none exists in this
latter case, it should have thought so in the former. But it
did not, and the reason it did not is obvious beyond any
doubt. It assumed a federal court would never be in the
position to retain jurisdiction over an action for which a tort
plaintiff has shown there is no federal-question basis, and
Congress was entitled to assume this, because it had provided that a certification was conclusive.

In sum, the congressional decision to make the Attorney
General's certification conclusive was couched in plain terms,
whose plain meaning is confirmed by contrasting the absence
of any provision for review with just such a provision in the
predecessor statute, and with an express provision for review of a refusal to certify, contained in the Westfall Act
itself. The Court's contrary view implies a jurisdictional
tenacity that Congress expressly declined to assert elsewhere in the Act, and invites a difficult and wholly unnecessary constitutional adjudication about the limits of Article

Souter, J., dissenting
III jurisdiction. These are powerful reasons to recognizethe unreviewability of certification, and the Court's contrary

arguments fail to measure up to them.The Court raises three counterpoints to a straightforward
reading of the Act. First, it suggests that language in

$ 2679(d)(2) negatively implies that Congress intended to au-thorize judicial review of scope-of-employment certifications,

and that, in fact, the straightforward reading of the statuteresults in a drafting redundancy. Second, the Court claims
that the straightforward reading creates an oddity by limit-ing the role of federal courts in certain cases. Finally, the
Court invokes the presumption against judging one's self.The redundancy argument, it must be said, is facially plausible. It begins with the sound general rule that Congress
is deemed to avoid redundant drafting, Mackey v. Lanier
Collection Agency & Service, Inc., 486 U. S. 825, 837 (1988);
see Park 'N Fly, Inc. v. Dollar Park & Fly, Inc., 469 U. S.189, 196-197 (1985), from which it follows that a statutory

interpretation that would render an express provision redun-dant was probably unintended and should be rejected.
Applying that rule here, the argument is that if certificationby the Attorney General conclusively establishes scope of
employment for substitution purposes, then there is no need
for the final sentence in $ 2679(d)(2), that certification "shall
conclusively establish scope of office or employment for purposes of removal" in cases brought against federal employees
in state court. If certification is conclusive as to substitution it will be equally conclusive as to removal, since the
federal defendant will necessarily be entitled to claim jurisdiction of a federal court under 28 U. S. C. $ 1346(b). See
ante, at 432, n. 8. Accordingly, the Court suggests the provision making certification conclusive for purposes of removal must have greater meaning; it must carry the negative
implication that certification is not conclusive for purposes of
substitution. Ante, at 432.

Sometimes, however, there is an explanation for redundancy, rendering any asserted inference from it too shaky to

be trusted. Cf. United States Nat. Bank of Ore. v. Independent Ins. Agents of America, Inc., 508 U. S. 439, 459
(1993). That is the case with the provision that certificationis conclusive on the issue of removal from state to federal

court. The explanation takes us back to the Westfall Act's
predecessor, the Federal Drivers Act, 75 Stat. 539, whichwas superseded upon passage of the current statute, Pub. L.

100-694, 102 Stat. 4563-4567. The Drivers Act made theFTCA the exclusive source of remedies for injuries resulting from the operation of any motor vehicle by a federalemployee acting within the scope of his employment. 28
U. S. C. $ 2679(b) (1982 ed.). Like the Westfall Act, theDrivers Act authorized the Attorney General to certify that
a federal employee sued in state court was acting within the
scope of employment during the incident allegedly givingrise to the claim, and it provided in that event for removal

to the federal system, as well as for substitution of theUnited States as the defendant. $ 2679(d). Unlike the
Westfall Act, however, the Drivers Act explicitly directeddistrict courts to review, "on a motion to remand held before
a trial on the merits," whether any such case was "one inwhich a remedy by suit . . . is not available against the United
States." Ibid. The district courts and the courts of appeals routinely read this language to permit district courts
to hear motions to remand challenging the Attorney General's scope-of-employment determination. See McGowan v.
Williams, 623 F. 2d 1239, 1242 (CA7 1980); Van Houten v.
Ralls, 411 F. 2d 940, 942 (CA9), cert. denied, 396 U. S. 962
(1969); Daugherty v. United States, 427 F. Supp. 222, 223-224
(WD Pa. 1977); accord, Seiden v. United States, 537 F. 2d 867,
869 (CA6 1976); Levin v. Taylor, 464 F. 2d 770, 771 (CADC
1972). Given the express permissibility of a motion to remand in order to raise a postremoval challenge to certification under the Drivers Act, when the old Act was superseded, and challenges to certification were eliminated,
Congress could sensibly have seen some practical value in
the redundancy of making it clear beyond question that the

old practice of considering scope of employment on motionsto remand was over.

4

How then does one assess the force of the redundancy?On my plain reading of the statute, one may take it as an

understandable inelegance of drafting. One could, in the al-ternative, take it as some confirmation for the Court's view,
even though the Court's view brings with it both a jurisdic-tional anomaly and the consequent certainty of a serious constitutional question. Is it not more likely that Congresswould have indulged in a little redundancy, than have meant
to foist such a pointless need for constitutional litigation ontothe federal courts? Given the choice, inelegance may be
forgiven.The Court's second counterpoint is that we should be reluctant to read the Westfall Act in a way that leaves a dis-trict court without any real work to do. The Court suggests
that my reading does just that in cases like this one, becausethe district court's sole function after the Attorney General
has issued a scope-of-employment certification is to enteran order of dismissal.

Ante, at 429. Of course, in the bulk
of cases with an Attorney General's certification, the sequence envisioned by the Court will never materialize.Even though a district court may not review the scope-ofemployment determination, it will still have plenty of workto do in the likely event that either liability or amount of

4 The Court concludes that the provision for review of certification was
omitted because it was joined with the provision for remand in the Drivers
Act. Ante, at 433, n. 10. On a matter of this substance, the explanation
does not give Congress credit for much intellectual discrimination. The
same footnote also sells this dissent a bit short: we have no need to argue
that omission of any provision to review scope of employment, in isolation,
would conclusively have foreclosed review, and we have made the very
point that a failure to provide for conclusiveness of removal would not
have left that issue in doubt; on each point, the various items of interpretive evidence supplied by the text and by textual comparison with the
Drivers Act are to be read together in pointing to whatever judgment
they support.

damages is disputed, or the United States's claim to immu-nity under 28 U. S. C. $ 2680 turns on disputed facts. Only

in those rare cases presenting a claim to federal immunitytoo airtight for the plaintiff to challenge will the circumstance identified by the Court even occur. It is hard
to find any significance in the fact that now and then acertification will relieve a federal court of further work,

given the straightforward and amply confirmed provisionfor conclusiveness.

The Court's final counterpoint to plain reading relies heav-ily on "the strong presumption that Congress intends judicial
review of administrative action," citing a line of cases involving judicial challenges to regulations claimed to be outside
the statutory authority of the administrative agencies that
promulgated them. See ante, at 424-425, citing Bowen v.
Michigan Academy of Family Physicians, 476 U. S. 667, 670-
673 (1986); Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U. S. 136, 140
(1967). It is, however, a fair question whether this presumption, usually applied to permit review of agency regulations carrying the force and effect of law, should apply with
equal force to a Westfall Act certification. The very narrow
factual determination committed to the Attorney General's
discretion is related only tangentially, if at all, to her primary
executive duties; she determines only whether a federal employee, who will probably not even be affiliated with the Justice Department, acted within the scope of his employment
on a particular occasion. This function is far removed from
the agency action that gave rise to the presumption of reviewability in Bowen, supra, at 668-669, in which the Court
considered whether Congress provided the Secretary of
Health and Human Services with nonreviewable authority to
promulgate certain Medicare distribution regulations, and in
Abbott Laboratories, supra, at 138-139, in which the Court
considered whether Congress provided the Secretary of
Health, Education and Welfare with nonreviewable authority
to promulgate certain prescription drug labeling regulations.

Souter, J., dissenting
The Court's answer that the presumption of reviewabilityshould control this case rests on the invocation of a different,

but powerful, principle, that no person may be a judge in hisown cause. Ante, at 427-429. But this principle is not apt
here. The Attorney General (who has delegated her West-fall Act responsibilities to the United States Attorneys, 28
CFR $ 15.3(a) (1994)) is authorized to determine when anyone of nearly three million federal employees was acting
within the scope of authority at an allegedly tortious mo-ment. She will characteristically have no perceptible interest in the effect of her certification decision, except in thework it may visit on her employees or the liability it may
ultimately place on the National Government (each of whichconsiderations could only influence her to deny certification
subject to the employee's right to challenge her). And evenwhere she certifies under circumstances of the Government's
immunity, as here, she does not save her employer, theUnited States, from any liability it would face in the absence
of certification; if she refused to certify, the Governmentwould remain as free of exposure as if she issued a certification. The most that can be claimed is that when the Govern-ment would enjoy immunity it would be easy to do a favor
for a federal employee by issuing a certification. But at thispoint the possibility of institutional self-interest has simply
become de minimis,5 and the likelihood of improper influence

5 The Court tries to convert this minimal influence into a "conflict of
interest," ante, at 436, derived from an "impetus to certify [that is] overwhelming," ante, at 427, said to arise from a United States Attorney's fear
that a Government employee would contest a refusal to certify and force
the United States Attorney to litigate the issue. This suggestion will
appear plausible or not depending on one's view of the frailty of United
States Attorneys. We have to doubt that the Attorney General sees her
United States Attorneys as quite so complaisant, and if Congress had
thought that the Government's lawyers would certify irresponsibly just to
avoid preparing for a hearing it would surely have retained the Drivers
Act's provision for review of certification.

has become too attenuated to analogize to the case in whichthe interested party would protect himself by judging his

own cause or otherwise take the law into his own hands indisregard of established legal process. Although the Court
quotes at length from the traditional condemnations of self-interested judgments,

ante, at 428-429, its citations wouldbe on point here only if the employee were issuing the certification. But of course, the employee is not the one whodoes it, and the Attorney General plainly lacks the kind of
self-interest that " `would certainly bias [her] judgment, and,not improbably, corrupt [her] integrity. . . .' " Ante, at 428,
quoting The Federalist No. 10, p. 79 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961)(J. Madison).

effect only if reference to "specific language or specific legis-lative history" and "inferences of intent drawn from the statutory scheme as a whole," Block v. Community Nutrition
Institute, 467 U. S. 340, 349 (1984), leave the Court with"substantial doubt" as to Congress's design,

work to do.I would affirm.

OKLAHOMA TAX COMMISSION v. CHICKASAWNATION
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe tenth circuit

No. 94-771. Argued April 24, 1995--Decided June 14, 1995
Respondent Chickasaw Nation (Tribe) filed this action to stop Oklahoma

from enforcing several state taxes against the Tribe and its members.
Pertinent here, the District Court held for the State on the motor fuels
tax question, and largely for the Tribe on the income tax issue. The
Court of Appeals ruled for the Tribe and its members on both issues,
determining: (1) that, without congressional authorization, the State
could not impose a motor fuels tax on fuel sold by the Tribe at its retail
stores on tribal trust land; and (2) that the State could not tax the wages
of tribal members employed by the Tribe, even if they reside outside
Indian country.

Held:

1. Oklahoma may not apply its motor fuels tax, as currently designed,
to fuel sold by the Tribe in Indian country. Pp. 455-462.

(a) The Court declines to address the State's argument, raised for
the first time in its brief on the merits, that the Hayden-Cartwright Act
expressly authorizes States to tax motor fuel sales on Indian reservations. Pp. 456-457.

(b) When a State attempts to levy a tax directly on Indian tribes
or their members inside Indian country, the proper approach is not, as
the State contends, to weigh the relevant state and tribal interests.
Rather, a more categorical approach should be employed: Absent clear
congressional authorization, a State is without power to tax reservation
lands and reservation Indians. The initial and frequently dispositive
question in Indian tax cases, therefore, is who bears the legal incidence
of the tax, for if it is a tribe or tribal members inside Indian country,
the tax cannot be enforced absent federal legislation permitting the impost. The inquiry proper in this case is whether the fuels tax rests on
the Tribe as retailer, or on the wholesaler who sells to the Tribe or the
consumer who buys from the Tribe. Judicial focus on legal incidence
accords due deference to Congress' lead role in evaluating state taxation
as it bears on Indian tribes and tribal members. A "legal incidence"
test, furthermore, provides a reasonably bright-line standard accommodating the reality that tax administration requires predictability. And

451Cite as: 515 U. S. 450 (1995)
Syllabus
a State unable to enforce its tax because the legal incidence falls on
tribes or on Indians within Indian country, generally is free to amend
its law to shift the tax's legal incidence. Pp. 457-460.

(c) The Court of Appeals' ruling that the fuels tax's legal incidence
rests on the retailer is reasonable. The state legislation does not expressly identify who bears the tax's legal incidence. Nor does it contain
a provision requiring that the tax be passed on to consumers. In the
absence of such dispositive language, the question is one of fair interpretation of the taxing statute as written and applied. In this case, the
fuels tax law's language and structure indicate that the tax is imposed
on fuel retailers. Pp. 461-462.

2. Oklahoma may tax the income of tribal members who work for
the Tribe but reside in the State outside Indian country. The Court
of Appeals' holding to the contrary conflicts with the well-established
principle of interstate and international taxation that a jurisdiction may
tax all the income of its residents, even income earned outside the taxing jurisdiction. The exception that the Tribe would carve out of the
State's taxing authority gains no support from the rule that Indians and
tribes are generally immune from state taxation, as this principle does
not operate outside Indian country. In addition, the Treaty of Dancing
Rabbit Creek, which guarantees the Tribe and its members that "no
Territory or State shall ever have a right to pass laws for the [Tribe's]
government," provides only for the Tribe's sovereignty within Indian
country and does not confer super-sovereign authority to interfere with
another jurisdiction's sovereign right to tax income, from all sources, of
those who choose to live within that jurisdiction's limits. Nor can the
Treaty be read to incorporate the repudiated doctrine that an income
tax imposed on government employees should be treated as a tax on
the government. The Treaty's signatories likely gave no thought to a
State's authority to tax income of tribal members living in the State's
domain, since the Treaty's purpose was to move the Tribe to unsettled
land not then within a State. Moreover, if that doctrine were to apply,
it would require exemption for nonmember as well as tribal member
employees of the Tribe. Pp. 462-467.

Opinion of the Court
its motor fuels excise tax upon fuel sold by Chickasaw Nationretail stores on tribal trust land; (2) May Oklahoma impose

its income tax upon members of the Chickasaw Nation whoare employed by the Tribe but who reside in the State outside Indian country.2We hold that Oklahoma may not apply its motor fuels tax,
as currently designed, to fuel sold by the Tribe in Indiancountry. In so holding, we adhere to settled law: when Congress does not instruct otherwise, a State's excise tax is un-enforceable if its legal incidence falls on a Tribe or its members for sales made within Indian country. We further hold,however, that Oklahoma may tax the income (including
wages from tribal employment) of all persons, Indian andnon-Indian alike, residing in the State outside Indian country. The Treaty between the United States and the Tribe,which guarantees the Tribe and its members that "no Territory or State shall ever have a right to pass laws for thegovernment of " the Chickasaw Nation, does not displace the
rule, accepted interstate and internationally, that a sover-eign may tax the entire income of its residents.

The Chickasaw Nation, a federally recognized IndianTribe, commenced this civil action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma, to stop theState of Oklahoma from enforcing several state taxes against
the Tribe and its members.3 Pertinent here, the District

Opinion of the Court
Court, ruling on cross-motions for summary judgment, heldfor the State on the motor fuels tax imposition and largely

for the Tribe on the income tax issue. The Court of Appealsfor the Tenth Circuit ruled for the Tribe and its members on
both issues: It held that the State may not apply the motorfuels tax to fuel sold by the Tribe's retail stores, and, further,
that the State may not tax the wages of members of theChickasaw Nation who work for the Tribe, even if they reside outside Indian country. 31 F. 3d 964 (1994).Concerning the motor fuels tax, the Tenth Circuit disapproved the District Court's "balancing of the respectivetribal and state interests" approach.

Id., at 972. The legalincidence of the tax, the Court of Appeals ruled, is the key

concept. That incidence, the Tenth Circuit determined, fallsdirectly on fuel retailers--here, on the Tribe, due to its operation of two convenience stores that sell fuel to tribal mem-bers and other persons. Oklahoma's imposition of its fuels
tax on the Tribe as retailer, the Court of Appeals concluded,"conflicts with . . . the traditional scope of Indian sovereign
authority." Ibid. Because the State asserted no congres-sional authorization for its exaction, the Tenth Circuit declared the fuels tax preempted.Oklahoma's income tax, in the Court of Appeals' view,
could not be applied to any tribal member employed by theTribe;

4 residence, the Tenth Circuit said, was "simply not

relevant to [its] determination." Id., at 979. The Court ofAppeals relied on the provision of the Treaty of Dancing

sales taxes on 3.2% beer sold at the Tribe's two convenience stores, as well
as tax warrants issued against officers of the Tribe. In the course of

for the government of the [Chickasaw] Nation of Red Peopleand their descendants." To this treaty language, the Tenth
Circuit applied "the general rule that `[d]oubtful expressionsare to be resolved in favor of ' the Indians." 31 F. 3d, at 978
(quoting McClanahan v. Arizona Tax Comm'n, 411 U. S.164, 174 (1973)). The Court of Appeals also noted that it
had endeavored to "rea[d] the treaty as the Indians [whosigned it] would have understood it." 31 F. 3d, at 979.

We granted the State's petition for certiorari, 513 U. S.1071 (1995), and now (1) affirm the Court of Appeals' judgment as to the motor fuels tax, and (2) reverse that judgmentas to the income tax applied to earnings of tribal members

The Tribe contends, and the Tenth Circuit held, that Okla-homa's fuels tax

or consumers. The respect due to the Chickasaw Nation'ssovereignty, the Tribe maintains, means Oklahoma--absent

congressional permission--may not collect its tax for fuelsupplied to, and sold by, the Tribe at its convenience

vests the Federal Government with exclusive authority overrelations with Indian tribes . . . , and in recognition of the

are exempt from state taxation within their own territory."Montana v. Blackfeet Tribe, 471 U. S. 759, 764 (1985); see

also, e. g., Mescalero Apache Tribe v. Jones, 411 U. S. 145,148 (1973).

In response, Oklahoma urges that Indian tribes and theirmembers are not inevitably, but only " `generally,' " immune
from state taxation. Brief for Petitioner 19 (quoting Blackfeet Tribe, 471 U. S., at 764). At least as to some aspects ofstate taxation, Oklahoma asserts, an approach "balancing the

state and tribal interests" is in order. Brief for Petitioner17. Even if the legal incidence of the fuels tax falls on the
Tribe (as retailer), Oklahoma concludes, tax immunity shouldbe disallowed here because "the state interest supporting
the levy is compelling, . . . the tribal interest is insubstantial, and . . . the state tax would have no effect on `tribalgovernance and self-determination.' " Id., at 22 (emphasis

in original).In the alternative, Oklahoma argues that the Court of Appeals "erred in holding that the legal incidence of the fueltax falls on the retailer." Id., at 10. Moreover, the State
newly contends, even if the fuels tax otherwise would beimpermissible, Congress, in the 1936 Hayden-Cartwright
Act, 4 U. S. C. $ 104, expressly permitted state taxation ofreservation activity of this type. Brief for Petitioner 23-24.

We set out first our reason for refusing to entertain at thislate date Oklahoma's argument that the Hayden-Cartwright
Act expressly permits state levies on motor fuels sold onIndian reservations. We then explain why we agree with
the Tenth Circuit on the Tribe's exemption from Oklahoma'sfuels tax.

On brief, the State points out--for the first time in thislitigation--that the Hayden-Cartwright Act, 4 U. S. C. $ 104,

expressly authorizes States to tax motor fuel sales on"United States military or other reservations." $ 104(a).
The Act's word "reservations," Oklahoma maintains, encom-passes Indian reservations. Brief for Petitioner 23-24. We

Opinion of the Court
The State made no reference to the Hayden-Cartwright Actin the courts of first and second instance. And even though

the Court of Appeals flagged the Act's possible relevance,6Oklahoma did not mention this 1936 legislation in its petition
for certiorari. Nor is Oklahoma's newly discovered claim ofvintage legislative authorization "fairly included"

question the State tendered for our review: "Whether princi-ples of federal pre-emption or Indian sovereignty preclude a

State from imposing a tax on motor fuel sold by an Indiantribe . . . . ?" Pet. for Cert. (i). As a court of review, not
one of first view, we will entertain issues withheld until mer-its briefing " `only in the most exceptional cases.' "

Yee v.Escondido, 503 U. S. 519, 535 (1992) (citation omitted). This

case does not fit that bill. B

Assuming, then, that Congress has not expressly author-ized the imposition of Oklahoma's fuels tax on fuel sold by the
Tribe, we must decide if the State's exaction is nonethelesspermitted. Oklahoma asks us to make the determination by
weighing the relevant state and tribal interests, and urgesthat the balance tilts in its favor. Oklahoma emphasizes
that the fuel sold is used "almost exclusively on state roads,"imposing "very substantial costs on the State--but no burden at all on the Tribe." Brief for Petitioner 9. The State

"In White Mountain Apache Tribe v. Bracker, 448 U. S. 136, 151, n. 16 . . .

reservations might be encompassed by the Hayden-Cartwright Act, 4
U. S. C. $ 104, which provides for the imposition of state fuel taxes `on
United States military or other reservations.' This issue was not raised
before this court, and we express no opinion on it." 31 F. 3d 964, 972,

Opinion of the Court
also stresses that "the levy does not reach any value gener-ated by the Tribe on Indian land,"

id., at 10; i. e., the fuel is
not produced or refined in Indian country, and is often soldto outsiders.

We have balanced federal, state, and tribal interests in diverse contexts, notably, in assessing state regulation thatdoes not involve taxation, see,

e. g., California v. Cabazon
Band of Mission Indians, 480 U. S. 202, 216-217 (1987) (bal-ancing interests affected by State's attempt to regulate onreservation high-stakes bingo operation), and state attemptsto compel Indians to collect and remit taxes actually imposed
on non-Indians, see, e. g., Moe v. Confederated Salish and
Kootenai Tribes of Flathead Reservation, 425 U. S. 463, 483
(1976) (balancing interests affected by State's attempt to require tribal sellers to collect cigarette tax on non-Indians;
precedent about state taxation of Indians is not controlling
because "this [collection] burden is not, strictly speaking, a
tax at all").

But when a State attempts to levy a tax directly on an
Indian tribe or its members inside Indian country, rather
than on non-Indians, we have employed, instead of a balancing inquiry, "a more categorical approach: `[A]bsent cession
of jurisdiction or other federal statutes permitting it,' we
have held, a State is without power to tax reservation lands
and reservation Indians." County of Yakima v. Confederated Tribes and Bands of Yakima Nation, 502 U. S. 251, 258
(1992) (citation omitted). Taking this categorical approach,
we have held unenforceable a number of state taxes whose
legal incidence rested on a tribe or on tribal members inside
Indian country. See, e. g., Bryan v. Itasca County, 426 U. S.
373 (1976) (tax on Indian-owned personal property situated
in Indian country); McClanahan, 411 U. S., at 165-166 (tax
on income earned on reservation by tribal members residing
on reservation).

The initial and frequently dispositive question in Indian
tax cases, therefore, is who bears the legal incidence of a tax.

459Cite as: 515 U. S. 450 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
If the legal incidence of an excise tax rests on a tribe or on
tribal members for sales made inside Indian country, the tax
cannot be enforced absent clear congressional authorization.
See, e. g., Moe, 425 U. S., at 475-481 (Montana's cigarette
sales tax imposed on retail consumers could not be applied
to on-reservation "smoke shop" sales to tribal members).
But if the legal incidence of the tax rests on non-Indians, no
categorical bar prevents enforcement of the tax; if the balance of federal, state, and tribal interests favors the State,
and federal law is not to the contrary, the State may impose
its levy, see Washington v. Confederated Tribes of Colville
Reservation, 447 U. S. 134, 154-157 (1980), and may place on
a tribe or tribal members "minimal burdens" in collecting
the toll, Department of Taxation and Finance of N. Y. v.
Milhelm Attea & Bros., 512 U. S. 61, 73 (1994). Thus, the
inquiry proper here is whether the legal incidence of Oklahoma's fuels tax rests on the Tribe (as retailer), or on some
other transactors--here, the wholesalers who sell to the
Tribe or the consumers who buy from the Tribe.8

Judicial focus on legal incidence in lieu of a more venturesome approach accords due deference to the lead role of Congress in evaluating state taxation as it bears on Indian tribes
and tribal members. See Yakima, 502 U. S., at 267. The
State complains, however, that the legal incidence of a tax
" `has no relationship to economic realities.' " Brief for Petitioner 30 (quoting Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady,
430 U. S. 274, 279 (1977)). But our focus on a tax's legal
incidence accommodates the reality that tax administration

8 In weighing the affected interests without determining the legal incidence of the fuels tax, the District Court apparently confused our cases
about state taxation of non-Indians with those about state taxation of
Indians. The court cited a case of the former type, Washington v.
Confederated Tribes of Colville Reservation, 447 U. S. 134 (1980). See
App. to Pet. for Cert. 36a. But in Colville we resorted to balancing only
after determining that the legal incidence of the challenged levy was on
non-Indian consumers. 447 U. S., at 142, n. 9.

460 OKLAHOMA TAX COMM'N v. CHICKASAW NATION

Opinion of the Court
requires predictability. The factors that would enter intoan inquiry of the kind the State urges are daunting. If

we were to make "economic reality" our guide, we mightbe obliged to consider, for example, how completely retailers
can pass along tax increases without sacrificing sales vol-ume--a complicated matter dependent on the characteristics
of the market for the relevant product. Cf. Yakima, 502U. S., at 267-268 (categorical approach safeguards against
risk of litigation that could "engulf the States' annual assess-ment and taxation process, with the validity of each levy
dependent upon a multiplicity of factors that vary from yearto year, and from parcel to parcel").

By contrast, a "legal incidence" test, as 11 States withlarge Indian populations have informed us, "provide[s] a
reasonably bright-line standard which, from a tax admin-istration perspective, responds to the need for substantial
certainty as to the permissible scope of state taxationauthority." Brief for South Dakota et al. as Amici Curiae
2.9 And if a State is unable to enforce a tax because thelegal incidence of the impost is on Indians or Indian tribes,
the State generally is free to amend its law to shift the tax'slegal incidence. So, in this case, the State recognizes and
the Tribe agrees that Oklahoma could accomplish what ithere seeks "by declaring the tax to fall on the consumer and
directing the Tribe to collect and remit the levy." Pet. forCert. 17; see Brief for Respondent 10-13.

10

9 Support for focusing on legal incidence is also indicated in cases arising
in the analogous context of the Federal Government's immunity from state
taxation. See United States v. County of Fresno, 429 U. S. 452, 459 (1977)
("States may not . . . impose taxes the legal incidence of which falls on the
Federal Government.").

10 A measure designed to do just that, Committee Substitute for H. B.

1522, 45th Okla. Leg., 1st Sess. (1995), was approved by the Oklahoma
House of Representatives on March 9, 1995, but failed to gain passage in
the Oklahoma Senate during the legislature's 1995 session. See Brief for

Opinion of the Court

C
The State also argues that, even if legal incidence is key,the Tenth Circuit erred in holding that the fuels tax's legal

incidence rests on the retailer (here, the Tribe). We con-sider the Court of Appeals' ruling on this point altogether
reasonable, and therefore uphold it. See, e. g., Haring v.
Prosise, 462 U. S. 306, 314, n. 8 (1983) (noting "our practiceto accept a reasonable construction of state law by the court

of appeals").The Oklahoma legislation does not expressly identify who
bears the tax's legal incidence--distributors, retailers, orconsumers; nor does it contain a "pass through" provision,
requiring distributors and retailers to pass on the tax'scost to consumers. Cf.

Moe, 425 U. S., at 482 (statute atissue provided that Montana cigarette tax " `shall be conclusively presumed to be [a] direct [tax] on the retail consumerprecollected for the purpose of convenience and facility
only' ").In the absence of such dispositive language, the question
is one of "fair interpretation of the taxing statute as writtenand applied."

California Bd. of Equalization v. Cheme-huevi Tribe, 474 U. S. 9, 11 (1985) (per curiam). Oklahoma's

law requires fuel distributors to "remit" the amount of taxdue to the Tax Commission; crucially, the statute describes
this remittal by the distributor as "on behalf of a licensed
retailer." Okla. Stat., Tit. 68, $ 505(C) (1991) (emphasisadded). The inference that the tax obligation is legally the

retailer's, not the distributor's, is supported by the prescrip-tions that sales between distributors are exempt from taxation, $ 507, but sales from a distributor to a retailer are
subject to taxation, $ 505(E). Further, if the distributorremits taxes it subsequently is unable to collect from the

retailer, the distributor may deduct the uncollected amountfrom its future payments to the Tax Commission. $ 505(C).
The distributor, then, "is no more than a transmittal agent

462 OKLAHOMA TAX COMM'N v. CHICKASAW NATION

Opinion of the Court
for the taxes imposed on the retailer." 31 F. 3d, at 971.And for their services as "agent of the state for [tax] collection," distributors retain a small portion of the taxes theycollect. $ 506(a).

The fuels tax law contains no comparable indication thatretailers are simply collection agents for taxes ultimately imposed on consumers. No provision sets off the retailer's lia-bility when consumers fail to make payments due; neither
are retailers compensated for their tax collection efforts.And the tax imposed when a distributor sells fuel to a retailer applies whether or not the fuel is ever purchased by aconsumer. See,

e. g., $ 502 ("There is hereby levied an excisetax . . . upon the sale of each and every gallon of gasoline

sold, or stored and distributed, or withdrawn from storage. . . ."). Finally, Oklahoma's law imposes no liability of any
kind on a consumer for purchasing, possessing, or using un-taxed fuel; in contrast, the legislation makes it unlawful for
distributors or retailers "to sell or offer for sale in this state,motor fuel or diesel fuel while delinquent in the payment of
any excise tax due the state." $ 505(C).As the Court of Appeals fairly and reasonably concluded:
"[T]he import of the language and the structure of the fueltax statutes is that the distributor collects the tax from the
retail purchaser of the fuel"; the "motor fuel taxes are legallyimposed on the retailer rather than on the distributor or the
consumer." 31 F. 3d, at 971-972.

III
Regarding Oklahoma's income tax, the Court of Appealsdeclared that the State may not tax the wages of members

of the Chickasaw Nation who work for the Tribe, includingmembers who reside in Oklahoma outside Indian country.

The holding on tribal members who live in the State out-side Indian country runs up against a well-established principle of interstate and international taxation--namely, thata jurisdiction, such as Oklahoma, may tax all the income

"That the receipt of income by a resident of the territoryof a taxing sovereignty is a taxable event is universally

recognized. Domicil itself affords a basis for such taxa-tion. Enjoyment of the privileges of residence in the

Opinion of the Court
The Tribe seeks to block the State from exercising its ordi-nary prerogative to tax the income of every resident; in particular, the Tribe seeks to shelter from state taxation theincome of tribal members who live in Oklahoma outside Indian country but work for the Tribe on tribal lands.13 Forthe exception the Tribe would carve out of the State's taxing
authority, the Tribe gains no support from the rule that Indi-ans and Indian tribes are generally immune from state taxation, McClanahan v. Arizona Tax Comm'n, 411 U. S. 164(1973), as this principle does not operate outside Indian country. Oklahoma Tax Comm'n v. Sac and Fox Nation, 508U. S. 114, 123-126 (1993).

Notably, the Tribe has not asserted here, or before theCourt of Appeals, that the State's tax infringes on tribal
self-governance. See Brief in Opposition 9-10 ("infringe-ment" question is not presented to this Court); Brief for Respondent 42, n. 37; see also Sac and Fox, 508 U.

Concerning salaries of United States resident "diplomats and employees
of international organizations," post, at 470, the dissent speaks of "treaties" as the wellsprings of "an exception" to otherwise governing tax law.
That is not quite right. It is dominantly United States internal law that
sets the ground rules for exemptions accorded employees of foreign governments and international organizations. In return for exemption of foreign government employees from United States federal taxation, $ 893 of
the Internal Revenue Code requires that the employer government grant
equivalent exemption to United States Government employees performing
similar services abroad. 26 U. S. C. $ 893(a)(3); see Toll v. Moreno, 458
U. S. 1, 15-16 (1982) (identifying statutory genesis of $ 893 exemption); 1
J. Isenbergh, International Taxation 393-394 (1990).

13 The Tribe's claim, as presented in this case, is a narrow one. The

Tribe does not assert here its authority to tax the income of these tribal
members. Nor does it complain that Oklahoma fails to award a credit
against state taxes for taxes paid to the Tribe.

earned from work performed for the Tribe itself when theemployee does not reside in Indian country").

Instead, the Tribe relies on the argument that Oklahoma'slevy impairs rights granted or reserved by federal law. See

Mescalero Apache Tribe v. Jones, 411 U. S., at 148-149("[E]xpress federal law to the contrary" overrides the general rule that "Indians going beyond reservation boundarieshave generally been held subject to nondiscriminatory state
law otherwise applicable to all citizens of the State."). TheTribe invokes the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek, Sept. 27,
1830, Art. IV, 7 Stat. 333-334, which provides in pertinentpart:

"The Government and people of the United States arehereby obliged to secure to the said [Chickasaw

15] Nation of Red People the jurisdiction and government ofall the persons and property that may be within their

limits west, so that no Territory or State shall ever havea right to pass laws for the government of the [Chickasaw] Nation of Red People and their descendants . . . butthe U. S. shall forever secure said [Chickasaw] Nation
from, and against, all [such] laws . . . ."
According to the Tribe, the State's income tax, when imposedon tribal members employed by the Tribe, is a law "for the

government of the [Chickasaw] Nation of Red People andtheir descendants," and it is immaterial that these "descendants" live outside Indian country.In evaluating this argument, we are mindful that "treaties
should be construed liberally in favor of the Indians."

14 The United States suggests, as a potential disposition, that we remand
on the "self-governance" question. Brief for United States as Amicus
Curiae 30, n. 18. But an interference-with-self-governance plea was
neither made in the lower courts nor presented here, and is therefore
foreclosed in this case.

15 This treaty, first concluded between the United States and the Choctaw Nation in 1830, became applicable to the Chickasaw Nation in 1837.

County of Oneida v. Oneida Indian Nation of N. Y., 470U. S. 226, 247 (1985). But liberal construction cannot save

the Tribe's claim, which founders on a clear geographic limitin the Treaty. By its terms, the Treaty applies only to persons and property "within [the Nation's] limits." We com-prehend this Treaty language to provide for the Tribe's sovereignty within Indian country. We do not read the Treatyas conferring super-sovereign authority to interfere with another jurisdiction's sovereign right to tax income, from allsources, of those who choose to live within that jurisdiction's limits.The Tribe and the United States

16 further urge us to read

the Treaty in accord with the repudiated view that an incometax imposed on government employees should be treated

as a tax on the government. See Dobbins v. Commissioners of Erie Cty., 16 Pet. 435 (1842). But see Graves v. New
York ex rel. O'Keefe, 306 U. S. 466, 480 (1939) ("The theory,which once won a qualified approval, that a tax on income is

legally or economically a tax on its source, is no longer tena-ble . . . ."). Under this view, a tax on tribal members employed by the Tribe would be seen as an impermissible taxon the Tribe itself.

We doubt the signatories meant to incorporate this now-defunct view into the Treaty. They likely gave no thought
to a State's authority to tax the income of tribal members

16 In its alliance with the Tribe, the United States is not an entirely
disinterested party. The United States affords Chickasaw tribal member
employees no exemption from federal income tax. See Squire v. Capoeman, 351 U. S. 1, 6 (1956) ("[I]n ordinary affairs of life, not governed by
treaties or remedial legislation, [Indians] are subject to the payment of
income taxes as are other citizens."); Hoptowit v. Commissioner, 709 F. 2d

tribal employment); Jourdain v. Commissioner, 617 F. 2d 507 (CA8) (per

curiam) (same), cert. denied, 449 U. S. 839 (1980). And, in computing
employees' federal income tax base, state income tax is allowed as an
itemized deduction. 26 U. S. C. $ 164(a)(3). Thus, an exemption of wages
from state income tax increases federal income tax revenue.

living in the State's domain, because they did not expect anymembers to be there. On the contrary, the purpose of the

Treaty was to put distance between the Tribe and the States.Under the Treaty, the Tribe moved across the Mississippi
River, from its traditional lands within Mississippi and Ala-bama, to unsettled lands not then within a State. See D.
Hale & A. Gibson, The Chickasaw 46-59 (1991).Moreover, importing the

Dobbins rule into the Treatywould prove too much. That dubious doctrine, by typing

taxation of wages earned by tribal employees as taxation ofthe Tribe itself, would require an exemption for all employees of the Tribe--not just tribal members, but nonmembersas well. The Court of Appeals rejected such an extension,
see 31 F. 3d, at 975 ("It is settled that the income tax isimposed on the employee, not the employer . . . . Therefore,
to the extent that the income tax is imposed on non-memberemployees who have no established claim to tribal ancestry,
the tax does not infringe upon the treaty prohibition."), andeven the Tribe is not urging this view before us, admitting

APPENDIX TO OPINION OF THE COURT

Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek,Sept. 27, 1830, Article IV,

property that may be within their limits west, so that noTerritory or State shall ever have a right to pass laws for

the government of the [Chickasaw] Nation of Red People andtheir descendants; and that no part of the land granted them
shall ever be embraced in any Territory or State; but the
U. S. shall forever secure said [Chickasaw] Nation from, andagainst, all laws except such as from time to time may be

enacted in their own National Councils, not inconsistent withthe Constitution, Treaties, and Laws of the United States;
and except such as may, and which have been enacted byCongress, to the extent that Congress under the Constitution are required to exercise a legislation over Indian Affairs.But the [Chickasaws], should this Treaty be ratified, express
a wish that Congress may grant to the [Chickasaws] the
right of punishing by their own laws, any white man who
shall come into their nation, and infringe any of their national regulations.

Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Stevens, Justice
O'Connor, and Justice Souter join, concurring in part and
dissenting in part.

I dissent from the portion of the Court's decision that permits Oklahoma to tax the wages that (1) the Tribe pays (2) to
members of the Tribe (3) who work for the Tribe (4) within
Indian country, but (5) who live outside Indian country, and,
apparently, commute to work. The issue is whether such a
tax falls within the scope of a promise this Nation made to
the Chickasaw Nation in 1837--a promise that no "State
shall ever have a right to pass laws for the government of
the [Chickasaw] Nation of Red People and their descendants
. . . but the U. S. shall forever secure said [Chickasaw] Nation
from, and against, all laws" except those the Tribe made itself (and certain others not relevant here). Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek, 7 Stat. 333 (1830) (see the Appendix to the
opinion of the Court); Treaty of Jan. 17, 1837, 11 Stat. 573.
In my view, this language covers the tax.

Opinion of Breyer, J.
For one thing, history suggests that the signatories to theTreaty intended the language to provide a broad guarantee

that state law would not apply to the Chickasaws if theymoved west of the Mississippi River--which they did. The
promise's broad reach was meant initially to induce the Choctaws to make such a move in 1830, and it was extended, in1837, to the Chickasaws for the same reason, all with the

hope that other tribes would follow. See A. DeRosier, Re-moval of the Choctaw Indians 46, 100-128 (1970);

id., at 104
(quoting, among other things, President Jackson's statementto Congress, in 1829, that "if the Indians remained east of

the Mississippi River, they would be subject to the laws of
the several states," but, if they accepted the Treaty and
moved west, they would be "free of white men except for a
few soldiers").

For another thing, the language of this promise, read
broadly and in light of its purpose, fits the tax at issue. The
United States promised to secure the "[Chickasaw] Nation
from, and against, all laws" for the government of the Nation, except those the Nation made itself or that Congress
made. Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek, supra (emphasis
added). The law in question does not fall within one of the
explicit exceptions to this promise. Nor need the Court
read the Treaty as creating an additional implied exception
where, as here, the law in question likely affects significantly
and directly the way in which the Tribe conducts its affairs
in areas subject to tribal jurisdiction--how much, for example, it will likely have to pay workers on its land and what
kinds of tribal expenditures it consequently will be able to
afford. The impact of the tax upon tribal wages, tribal
members, and tribal land makes it possible, indeed reasonable, to consider Oklahoma's tax (insofar as it applies to these
tribal wages) as amounting to a law "for the government of "
the Tribe. Indeed, in 1837, when the United States made
its promise to the Chickasaws, the law considered a tax like
the present one to be a tax on its source--i. e., the Tribe

Opinion of Breyer, J.
itself. See, e. g., Dobbins v. Commissioners of Erie Cty., 16Pet. 435, 445-448 (1842) (Federal Government employee salaries exempt from state tax laws). Although tax law subse-quently changed, see

Graves v. New York ex rel. O'Keefe, 306
U. S. 466, 480 (1939), the empirical connection between tax
and Tribe has not. The Treaty's basic objective, namely,practical protection for the Tribe, suggests that this unchanging empirical impact, rather than shifting legal taxtheory, is the critical consideration.

The majority sets forth several strong arguments againstthe Treaty's application. But, ultimately, I do not find them
convincing. It is true, as the majority points out, that wellestablished principles of tax law permit States to tax those
who reside within their boundaries. It is equally true that
the Chickasaws whom Oklahoma seeks to tax live in the
State at large, although they work in Indian country. But,
these truths simply pose the question in this case: Does the
Treaty provide an exception to well-established principles of
tax law, roughly the same way as do, say, treaties governing
diplomats and employees of international organizations?
See, e. g., Toll v. Moreno, 458 U. S. 1, 14-15 (1982) (explaining
that some such individuals are exempt from federal, state,
and local income taxation). The statement of basic tax principles, by themselves, cannot provide the answer.

The majority is also concerned about a "line-drawing"
problem. If the Treaty invalidates the law before us, what
about an Oklahoma tax, for example, on residents who work
for, but are not members of, the Tribe? I acknowledge the
problem of line drawing, but that problem exists irrespective
of where the line is drawn here. And, because this tax (1)
has a strong connection to tribal government (i. e., it falls on
tribal members, who work for the Tribe, in Indian country),
(2) does not regulate conduct outside Indian country, and (3)
does not (as the Solicitor General points out) represent an
effort to recover a proportionate share of, say, the cost of
providing state services to residents, I am convinced that it

471Cite as: 515 U. S. 450 (1995)
Opinion of Breyer, J.
falls on the side of the line that the Treaty's language andpurpose seek to prohibit. To decide that the Treaty prohibits the law here is not to decide whether or not it wouldprohibit a law with a weaker link to tribal government or a
stronger impact outside Indian country.One final legal consideration strengthens the conclusion I
reach. The law requires courts to construe ambiguous trea-ties in favor of the Indians.

County of Oneida v. OneidaIndian Nation of N. Y., 470 U. S. 226, 247 (1985). The majority believes that even a "liberal construction cannot savethe Tribe's claim," ante, at 466, because the Treaty says that
the United States is "obliged to secure to the said [Chicka-saw] Nation . . . the jurisdiction and government of all the
persons and property that may be within their limits west."Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek, 7 Stat. 333-334 (emphasis
added). This language, when viewed in its historical con-text, however, seems primarily designed to point out that
the Treaty operates only in respect to Chickasaw lands westof the Mississippi--

i. e., that the Chickasaws would receiveno protection unless they moved there. Regardless, the

Oklahoma tax in question does affect "persons," namely,tribal members, and "property," namely, their wages, which
members work and which wages are paid well "within" theNation's "limits,"

i. e., in Indian country. Admittedly, thequoted language, by itself, does not say for certain that such

effects are sufficient to bring the state law within the Trea-ty's prohibition, but neither does it clearly make residency
(rather than, say, place of employment) an absolute prerequi-site. In these circumstances, the law requires us to give the
Tribe the benefit of the doubt.Thus, in my view, whether we construe the Treaty's language liberally or literally, Oklahoma's tax falls within itsscope. For these reasons, I believe the Treaty bars the tax.
And, although I join the remainder of the Court's opinion, Irespectfully dissent on this point.

SANDIN, UNIT TEAM MANAGER, HALAWA COR-RECTIONAL FACILITY

v. CONNER et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 93-1911. Argued February 28, 1995--Decided June 19, 1995
In this suit, respondent Conner alleged that petitioner and other Hawaii

prison officials deprived him of procedural due process when an adjustment committee refused to allow him to present witnesses during a
disciplinary hearing and then sentenced him to segregation for misconduct. The District Court granted the officials summary judgment, but
the Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that Conner had a liberty
interest in remaining free of disciplinary segregation and that there was
a disputed question of fact whether he had received all of the process
due under Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U. S. 539. The court based its conclusion on a prison regulation instructing the committee to find guilt
when a misconduct charge is supported by substantial evidence, reasoning that the committee's duty to find guilt was nondiscretionary. From
that regulation, it drew a negative inference that the committee may
not impose segregation if it does not find substantial evidence of misconduct, that this is a state-created liberty interest, and that therefore
Wolff entitled Conner to call witnesses.

Held: Neither the Hawaii prison regulation nor the Due Process Clause

itself affords Conner a protected liberty interest that would entitle him
to the procedural protections set forth in Wolff. Pp. 477-488.

(a) Under Wolff, States may in certain circumstances create liberty
interests that are protected by the Due Process Clause. But these interests will generally be limited to freedom from restraint which, while
not exceeding the sentence in such an unexpected manner as to give
rise to protection by the Due Process Clause of its own force, nonetheless imposes atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation
to the ordinary incidents of prison life. See also Meachum v. Fano, 427
U. S. 215. The methodology used in Hewitt v. Helms, 459 U. S. 460, and
later cases has impermissibly shifted the focus of the liberty interest
inquiry from one based on the nature of the deprivation to one based
on language of a particular regulation. Under Hewitt's methodology,
prison regulations, such the one in this case, have been examined to
see whether mandatory language and substantive predicates create
an enforceable expectation that the State would produce a particular

Syllabus
outcome with respect to the prisoner's confinement conditions. This
shift in focus has encouraged prisoners to comb regulations in search of
mandatory language on which to base entitlements to various stateconferred privileges. Courts have, in response, drawn negative inferences from that language. Hewitt creates disincentives for States to
codify prison management procedures in the interest of uniform treatment in order to avoid the creation of "liberty" interests, and it has led
to the involvement of federal courts in the day-to-day management of
prisons. The time has come to return to those due process principles
that were correctly established and applied in Wolff and Meachum.
Pp. 477-484.

(b) Conner asserts, incorrectly, that any state action taken for a punitive reason encroaches upon a liberty interest under the Due Process
Clause even in the absence of any state regulation. Bell v. Wolfish, 441
U. S. 520 (1979), and Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U. S. 651 (1977), distinguished. Pp. 484-485.

(c) Conner's discipline in segregated confinement did not present the
type of atypical, significant deprivation in which a State might conceivably create a liberty interest. At the time of his punishment, disciplinary segregation mirrored those conditions imposed upon inmates
in administrative segregation and protective custody. Moreover, the
State later expunged his disciplinary record, with respect to the more
serious of the charges against him. And, his confinement did not exceed similar, but totally discretionary confinement in either duration or
degree of restriction. Conner's situation also does not present a case
where the State's action will inevitably affect the duration of his sentence, since the chance that the misconduct finding will affect his parole
status is simply too attenuated to invoke the Due Process Clause's procedural guarantees. Pp. 485-487.

Opinion of the Court
30 years to life in a Hawaii prison. He was confined in the
Halawa Correctional Facility, a maximum security prison in
central Oahu. In August 1987, a prison officer escorted him
from his cell to the module program area. The officer subjected Conner to a strip search, complete with an inspection
of the rectal area. Conner retorted with angry and foul language directed at the officer. Eleven days later he received
notice that he had been charged with disciplinary infractions.
The notice charged Conner with "high misconduct" for using
physical interference to impair a correctional function, and
"low moderate misconduct" for using abusive or obscene language and for harassing employees.1

Conner appeared before an adjustment committee on August 28, 1987. The committee refused Conner's request to
present witnesses at the hearing, stating that "[w]itnesses
were unavailable due to move [sic] to the medium facility
and being short staffed on the modules." App. to Pet. for
Cert. A-67. At the conclusion of proceedings, the committee determined that Conner was guilty of the alleged misconduct. It sentenced him to 30 days' disciplinary segregation

1 Hawaii's prison regulations establish a hierarchy of misconduct ranging
from "greatest misconduct," Haw. Admin. Rule $ 17-201-6(a) (1983), to
"minor misconduct," $ 17-201-10. Section 17-201-7 enumerates offenses
punishable as "high misconduct" and sets available punishment for such
offenses at disciplinary segregation up to 30 days or any sanction other
than disciplinary segregation. Section 17-201-9 lists offenses punishable
as "low moderate misconduct" and sets punishment at disciplinary segregation up to four hours in cell, monetary restitution, or any sanction other
than disciplinary segregation. In addition to the levels of misconduct
which classify various misdeeds, the regulations also define "serious misconduct" as "that which poses a serious threat to the safety, security, or
welfare of the staff, other inmates or wards, or the institution and subjects
the individual to the imposition of serious penalties such as segregation
for longer than four hours." $ 17-201-12. Such misconduct is punished
through adjustment committee procedures. Ibid. The parties apparently concede that the physical obstruction allegation constituted serious
misconduct, but that the low moderate misconduct charges did not.

charges to be served concurrent with the 30 days. Id., atA-66 to A-67. Conner's segregation began August 31, 1987,
and ended September 29, 1987.Conner sought administrative review within 14 days of
receiving the committee's decision. Haw. Admin. Rule$ 17-201-20(a) (1983). Nine months later, the deputy administrator found the high misconduct charge unsupported andexpunged Conner's disciplinary record with respect to that
charge. App. 249. But before the deputy administratordecided the appeal, Conner had brought this suit against the
adjustment committee chair and other prison officials in theUnited States District Court for the District of Hawaii based
on Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983. His amended com-plaint prayed for injunctive relief, declaratory relief, and
damages for, among other things, a deprivation of proceduraldue process in connection with the disciplinary hearing.
The District Court granted summary judgment in favor ofthe prison officials.

The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed thejudgment.

Conner v. Sakai, 15 F. 3d 1463 (1993). It con-cluded that Conner had a liberty interest in remaining free

from disciplinary segregation and that there was a disputedquestion of fact with respect to whether Conner received all

Haw. Admin. Rule $ 17-201-18(b)(2) (1983).3 The Court ofAppeals reasoned from Kentucky Dept. of Corrections v.
Thompson, 490 U. S. 454 (1989), that the committee's duty tofind guilt was nondiscretionary. From the language of the
regulation, it drew a negative inference that the committeemay not impose segregation if it does not find substantial
evidence of misconduct. 15 F. 3d, at 1466. It viewed thisas a state-created liberty interest, and therefore held that
respondent was entitled to call witnesses by virtue of ouropinion in

Our due process analysis begins with Wolff. There,Nebraska inmates challenged the decision of prison officials

to revoke good time credits without adequate procedures.418 U. S., at 553. Inmates earned good time credits under
a state statute that bestowed mandatory sentence reduc-tions for good behavior,

id., at 546, n. 6, revocable only for" `flagrant or serious misconduct,' "

id., at 545, n. 5 (citationomitted). We held that the Due Process Clause itself does

not create a liberty interest in credit for good behavior, butthat the statutory provision created a liberty interest in a
"shortened prison sentence" which resulted from good time

3 The full text of the regulation reads as follows:
"Upon completion of the hearing, the committee may take the matter
under advisement and render a decision based upon evidence presented at
the hearing to which the individual had an opportunity to respond or any
cumulative evidence which may subsequently come to light may be used
as a permissible inference of guilt, although disciplinary action shall be
based upon more than mere silence. A finding of guilt shall be made
where:

"(1) The inmate or ward admits the violation or pleads guilty.
"(2) The charge is supported by substantial evidence." Haw. Admin.
Rule $ 17-201-18(b)(2) (1983) (emphasis added).

Opinion of the Court
credits, credits which were revocable only if the prisoner wasguilty of serious misconduct.

Id., at 557. The Court characterized this liberty interest as one of "real substance"
ibid., and articulated minimum procedures necessary to
reach a "mutual accommodation between institutional needs
and objectives and the provisions of the Constitution," id.,at 556. Much of

Wolff 's contribution to the landscape of
prisoners' due process derived not from its descriptionof liberty interests, but rather from its intricate balancing

of prison management concerns with prisoners' liberty indetermining the amount of process due. Its short discussion of the definition of a liberty interest, Wolff, supra, at
556-558, led to a more thorough treatment of the issue in
Meachum v. Fano, 427 U. S. 215 (1976).

Inmates in Meachum sought injunctive relief, declaratory
relief, and damages by reason of transfers from a Massachusetts medium security prison to a maximum security facility
with substantially less favorable conditions. The transfers
were ordered in the aftermath of arson incidents for which
the transferred inmates were thought to be responsible, and
did not entail a loss of good time credits or any period of
disciplinary confinement. Id., at 222. The Court began
with the proposition that the Due Process Clause does not
protect every change in the conditions of confinement having
a substantial adverse impact on the prisoner. Id., at 224.
It then held that the Due Process Clause did not itself create
a liberty interest in prisoners to be free from intrastate
prison transfers. Id., at 225. It reasoned that transfer to a
maximum security facility, albeit one with more burdensome
conditions, was "within the normal limits or range of custody
which the conviction has authorized the State to impose."
Ibid.; see also Montanye v. Haymes, 427 U. S. 236, 242 (1976).
The Court distinguished Wolff by noting that there the protected liberty interest in good time credit had been created
by state law; here no comparable Massachusetts law stripped
officials of the discretion to transfer prisoners to alternative

Opinion of the Court
facilities "for whatever reason or for no reason at all."
Meachum, supra, at 228.4

Shortly after Meachum, the Court embarked on a different approach to defining state-created liberty interests. Because dictum in Meachum distinguished Wolff by focusing
on whether state action was mandatory or discretionary, the
Court in later cases laid ever greater emphasis on this somewhat mechanical dichotomy. Greenholtz v. Inmates of Neb.
Penal and Correctional Complex, 442 U. S. 1 (1979), foreshadowed the methodology that would come to full fruition
in Hewitt v. Helms, 459 U. S. 460 (1983). The Greenholtz
inmates alleged that they had been unconstitutionally denied
parole. Their claim centered on a state statute that set the
date for discretionary parole at the time the minimum term
of imprisonment less good time credits expired. The statute
ordered release of a prisoner at that time, unless one of four
specific conditions were shown. 442 U. S., at 11. The Court
apparently accepted the inmates' argument that the word
"shall" in the statute created a legitimate expectation of
release absent the requisite finding that one of the justifications for deferral existed, since the Court concluded that
some measure of constitutional protection was due. Nevertheless, the State ultimately prevailed because the minimal
process it had awarded the prisoners was deemed sufficient
under the Fourteenth Amendment.

4 Later cases, such as Vitek v. Jones, 445 U. S. 480 (1980), found that the
Due Process Clause itself confers a liberty interest in certain situations.
In Vitek, a prisoner was to be transferred involuntarily to a state mental
hospital for treatment of a mental disease or defect; the Court held that
his right to be free from such transfer was a liberty interest irrespective
of state regulation; it was "qualitatively different" from the punishment
characteristically suffered by a person convicted of crime, and had "stigmatizing consequences." Id., at 493-494. Washington v. Harper, 494
U. S. 210, 221-222 (1990), likewise concluded that, independent of any state
regulation, an inmate had a liberty interest in being protected from the
involuntary administration of psychotropic drugs.

480 SANDIN v. CONNER

Opinion of the Court
The Court made explicit in Hewitt what was implicit in
Greenholtz. In evaluating the claims of inmates who had
been confined to administrative segregation, it first rejectedthe inmates' claim of a right to remain in the general population as protected by the Due Process Clause on the authority
of Meachum, Montanye, and Vitek. The Due ProcessClause standing alone confers no liberty interest in freedom

from state action taken " `within the sentence imposed.' "459 U. S., at 468. It then concluded that the transfer to less
amenable quarters for nonpunitive reasons was "ordinarilycontemplated by a prison sentence."

Ibid. Examination of
the possibility that the State had created a liberty interest
by virtue of its prison regulations followed. Instead of looking to whether the State created an interest of "real substance" comparable to the good time credit scheme of Wolff,
the Court asked whether the State had gone beyond issuing
mere procedural guidelines and had used "language of an
unmistakably mandatory character" such that the incursion
on liberty would not occur "absent specified substantive
predicates." Id., at 471-472. Finding such mandatory directives in the regulations before it, the Court decided that
the State had created a protected liberty interest. It nevertheless, held, as it had in Greenholtz, that the full panoply of
procedures conferred in Wolff were unnecessary to safeguard the inmates' interest and, if imposed, would undermine the prison's management objectives.

As this methodology took hold, no longer did inmates need
to rely on a showing that they had suffered a " `grievous
loss' " of liberty retained even after sentenced to terms of
imprisonment. Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U. S. 471, 481
(1972) (citation omitted). For the Court had ceased to examine the "nature" of the interest with respect to interests allegedly created by the State. See ibid.; Board of Regents
of State Colleges v. Roth, 408 U. S. 564, 571 (1972). In a
series of cases since Hewitt, the Court has wrestled with the
language of intricate, often rather routine prison guidelines

481Cite as: 515 U. S. 472 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
to determine whether mandatory language and substantivepredicates created an enforceable expectation that the State

would produce a particular outcome with respect to the pris-oner's conditions of confinement.

In Olim v. Wakinekona, 461 U. S. 238 (1983), the claimants
identified prison regulations that required a particular kindof hearing before the prison administrator could, in his discretion, effect an interstate transfer to another prison. Par-sing the language of the regulation led the Court to hold that
the discretionary nature of the transfer decision negated anystate-created liberty interest.

Id., at 249-250. Kentucky
Dept. of Corrections v. Thompson, 490 U. S. 454 (1989), dealt
with regulations governing the visitation privileges of inmates. Asserting that a regulation created an absolute
right to visitors absent a finding of certain substantive predicates, the inmates sought review of the adequacy of the procedures. As in Wakinekona, the Court determined the regulation left visitor exclusion to the discretion of the officials,
and refused to elevate such expectations to the level of a
liberty interest. 490 U. S., at 464-465.

By shifting the focus of the liberty interest inquiry to one
based on the language of a particular regulation, and not the
nature of the deprivation, the Court encouraged prisoners to
comb regulations in search of mandatory language on which
to base entitlements to various state-conferred privileges.
Courts have, in response, and not altogether illogically,
drawn negative inferences from mandatory language in the
text of prison regulations. The Court of Appeals' approach
in this case is typical: It inferred from the mandatory directive that a finding of guilt "shall" be imposed under certain
conditions the conclusion that the absence of such conditions
prevents a finding of guilt.

Such a conclusion may be entirely sensible in the ordinary
task of construing a statute defining rights and remedies
available to the general public. It is a good deal less sensible in the case of a prison regulation primarily designed to

482 SANDIN v. CONNER

Opinion of the Court
guide correctional officials in the administration of a prison.Not only are such regulations not designed to confer rights

on inmates, but the result of the negative implication juris-prudence is not to require the prison officials to follow the
negative implication drawn from the regulation, but is instead to attach procedural protections that may be of quitea different nature. Here, for example, the Court of Appeals

did not hold that a finding of guilt could not be made in the
absence of substantial evidence. Instead, it held that the
"liberty interest" created by the regulation entitled the in-mate to the procedural protections set forth in

Wolff.
Hewitt has produced at least two undesirable effects.First, it creates disincentives for States to codify prison management procedures in the interest of uniform treatment.
Prison administrators need be concerned with the safety ofthe staff and inmate population. Ensuring that welfare

often leads prison administrators to curb the discretion ofstaff on the front line who daily encounter prisoners hostile
to the authoritarian structure of the prison environment.Such guidelines are not set forth solely to benefit the prisoner. They also aspire to instruct subordinate employeeshow to exercise discretion vested by the State in the warden,
and to confine the authority of prison personnel in order to
avoid widely different treatment of similar incidents. The
approach embraced by Hewitt discourages this desirable development: States may avoid creation of "liberty" interests
by having scarcely any regulations, or by conferring standardless discretion on correctional personnel.

Second, the Hewitt approach has led to the involvement of
federal courts in the day-to-day management of prisons,
often squandering judicial resources with little offsetting
benefit to anyone. In so doing, it has run counter to the
view expressed in several of our cases that federal courts
ought to afford appropriate deference and flexibility to state
officials trying to manage a volatile environment. Wolff, 418
U. S., at 561-563; Hewitt, 459 U. S., at 470-471; Jones v.

Opinion of the Court
125 (1977). Such flexibility is especially warranted in thefine-tuning of the ordinary incidents of prison life, a common

subject of prisoner claims since Hewitt. See, e. g., Klos v.Haskell, 48 F. 3d 81, 82 (CA2 1995) (claiming liberty interest
in right to participate in "shock program"--a type of bootcamp for inmates);

Segal v. Biller, No. 94-35448, 1994 U. S.App. LEXIS 30628 (CA9, Oct. 31, 1994) (unpublished) (claiming liberty interest in a waiver of the travel limit imposedon prison furloughs); Burgin v. Nix, 899 F. 2d 733, 735 (CA8
1990) (claiming liberty interest in receiving a tray lunchrather than a sack lunch); Spruytte v. Walters, 753 F. 2d 498,
506-508 (CA6 1985) (finding liberty interest in receiving apaperback dictionary due to a rule that states a prisoner
" `may receive any book . . . which does not present a threatto the order or security of the institution' ") (citation omitted); Lyon v. Farrier, 727 F. 2d 766, 768-769 (CA8 1984)(claiming liberty interest in freedom from transfer to a
smaller cell without electrical outlets for televisions andliberty interest in a prison job);

United States v. Michigan,680 F. Supp. 270, 277 (WD Mich. 1988) (finding liberty interest in not being placed on food loaf diet).In light of the above discussion, we believe that the search
for a negative implication from mandatory language in pris-oner regulations has strayed from the real concerns undergirding the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause.The time has come to return to the due process principles
we believe were correctly established and applied in Wolffand Meachum.

5 Following Wolff, we recognize that States

5 Such abandonment of Hewitt's methodology does not technically require us to overrule any holding of this Court. The Court in Olim v.
Wakinekona, 461 U. S. 238 (1983), and Kentucky Dept. of Corrections v.
Thompson, 490 U. S. 454 (1989), concluded no liberty interest was at stake.
Although it did locate a liberty interest in Hewitt, it concluded that due
process required no additional procedural guarantees for the inmate. As
such, its answer to the anterior question of whether the inmate possessed
a liberty interest at all was unnecessary to the disposition of the case.
Our decision today only abandons an approach that in practice is difficult
to administer and which produces anomalous results.

Opinion of the Court
may under certain circumstances create liberty interestswhich are protected by the Due Process Clause. See also

Board of Pardons v. Allen, 482 U. S. 369 (1987). But theseinterests will be generally limited to freedom from restraint
which, while not exceeding the sentence in such an unexpected manner as to give rise to protection by the Due Proc-ess Clause of its own force, see,

e. g., Vitek, 445 U. S., at 493
(transfer to mental hospital), and Washington, 494 U. S., at221-222 (involuntary administration of psychotropic drugs),

nonetheless imposes atypical and significant hardship on theinmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.

Conner asserts, incorrectly, that any state action taken fora punitive reason encroaches upon a liberty interest under
the Due Process Clause even in the absence of any state
regulation. Neither Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U. S. 520 (1979), nor
Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U. S. 651 (1977), requires such a
rule. Bell dealt with the interests of pretrial detainees and
not convicted prisoners. See also United States v. Salerno,
481 U. S. 739, 747 (1987) (distinguishing between "impermissible punishment" and "permissible regulation" of pretrial
detainees). The Court in Bell correctly noted that a detainee "may not be punished prior to an adjudication of guilt
in accordance with due process of law." 441 U. S., at 535.
The Court expressed concern that a State would attempt
to punish a detainee for the crime for which he was indicted
via preconviction holding conditions. Id., at 539. Such a
course would improperly extend the legitimate reasons for
which such persons are detained--to ensure their presence
at trial.6

6 Similar concerns drove the conclusion in Kennedy v. MendozaMartinez, 372 U. S. 144 (1963), holding that free citizens must receive procedural protections prior to revocation of citizenship for draft evasion.
Without discussing "liberty interests," the Court recognized that deprivation of the "most precious right" of citizenship necessitated process by
way of jury trial under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. Id., at 159.
As in Bell, the Court feared the Government would enforce the criminal

Opinion of the Court
The same distinction applies to Ingraham, which ad-dressed the rights of schoolchildren to remain free from arbitrary corporal punishment. The Court noted that the DueProcess Clause historically encompassed the notion that the
State could not "physically punish an individual except inaccordance with due process of law" and so found schoolchildren sheltered. 430 U. S., at 674. Although children sentto public school are lawfully confined to the classroom, arbitrary corporal punishment represents an invasion of personalsecurity to which their parents do not consent when entrusting the educational mission to the State.The punishment of incarcerated prisoners, on the other
hand, serves different aims than those found invalid in Belland Ingraham. The process does not impose retribution in
lieu of a valid conviction, nor does it maintain physical con-trol over free citizens forced by law to subject themselves
to state control over the educational mission. It effectuatesprison management and prisoner rehabilitative goals. See
State v. Alvey, 67 Haw. 49, 55, 678 P. 2d 5, 9 (1984). Admit-tedly, prisoners do not shed all constitutional rights at the
prison gate, Wolff, 418 U. S., at 555, but " `[l]awful incarcera-tion brings about the necessary withdrawal or limitation of
many privileges and rights, a retraction justified by the con-siderations underlying our penal system.' "

Jones, 433 U. S.,at 125, quoting Price v. Johnston, 334 U. S. 266, 285 (1948).

Discipline by prison officials in response to a wide range ofmisconduct falls within the expected perimeters of the
sentence imposed by a court of law.This case, though concededly punitive, does not present
a dramatic departure from the basic conditions of Conner'sindeterminate sentence. Although Conner points to dicta in
cases implying that solitary confinement automatically trig-gers due process protection,

Opinion of the Court
out deciding that freedom from punitive segregation for" `serious misconduct' " implicates a liberty interest, holding

only that the prisoner has no right to counsel) (citation omit-ted), this Court has not had the opportunity to address in an
argued case the question whether disciplinary confinement
of inmates itself implicates constitutional liberty interests.We hold that Conner's discipline in segregated confinement

did not present the type of atypical, significant deprivationin which a State might conceivably create a liberty interest.
The record shows that, at the time of Conner's punishment,disciplinary segregation, with insignificant exceptions, mirrored those conditions imposed upon inmates in adminis-trative segregation and protective custody.

7 We note also

that the State expunged Conner's disciplinary record withrespect to the "high misconduct" charge nine months after

Conner served time in segregation. Thus, Conner's con-finement did not exceed similar, but totally discretionary,
confinement in either duration or degree of restriction. Indeed, the conditions at Halawa involve significant amounts of"lockdown time" even for inmates in the general population.

8

Based on a comparison between inmates inside and outsidedisciplinary segregation, the State's actions in placing him

there for 30 days did not work a major disruption in hisenvironment.

9

7 Hawaii has repealed the regulations describing the structure of inmate
privileges in the SHU when confined in administrative segregation, Brief
for Petitioner 6, n. 3, but it retains inmate classification category "Maximum Custody I" in which inmate privileges are comparably limited. App.
to Brief for Petitioner 48a-71a.

8 General population inmates are confined to cells for anywhere between

12 and 16 hours a day, depending on their classification. 1 App. 126.

9 The State notes, ironically, that Conner requested that he be placed in

protective custody after he had been released from disciplinary segregation. Id., at 43. Conner's own expectations have at times reflected a
personal preference for the quietude of the SHU. Although we do not
think a prisoner's subjective expectation is dispositive of the liberty inter515us2$80h 08-12-98 17:26:03 PAGES OPINPGT

487Cite as: 515 U. S. 472 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
Nor does Conner's situation present a case where theState's action will inevitably affect the duration of his

sentence. Nothing in Hawaii's code requires the paroleboard to deny parole in the face of a misconduct record or
to grant parole in its absence, Haw. Rev. Stat. $$ 353-68,353-69 (1985), even though misconduct is by regulation a relevant consideration, Haw. Admin. Rule $ 23-700-33(b) (effec-tive Aug. 1992). The decision to release a prisoner rests on
a myriad of considerations. And, the prisoner is affordedprocedural protection at his parole hearing in order to
explain the circumstances behind his misconduct record.Haw. Admin. Rule $$ 23-700-31(a), 23-700-35(c), 23-700-36
(1983). The chance that a finding of misconduct will alterthe balance is simply too attenuated to invoke the procedural
guarantees of the Due Process Clause. The Court rejecteda similar claim in Meachum, 427 U. S., at 229, n. 8 (declining
to afford relief on the basis that petitioner's transfer rec-ord might affect his future confinement and possibility of
parole).10We hold, therefore, that neither the Hawaii prison regulation in question, nor the Due Process Clause itself, affordedConner a protected liberty interest that would entitle him to
the procedural protections set forth in Wolff. The regimeto which he was subjected as a result of the misconduct hearing was within the range of confinement to be normally ex-pected for one serving an indeterminate term of 30 years
to life.11
est analysis, it does provide some evidence that the conditions suffered
were expected within the contour of the actual sentence imposed.

10 Again, we note that Hawaii expunged Conner's record with respect

to the "high misconduct" charge, so he personally has no chance of receiving a delayed release from the parole board as a direct result of that
allegation.

11 Prisoners such as Conner, of course, retain other protection from arbitrary state action even within the expected conditions of confinement.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is accordingly

Reversed.

Justice Ginsburg, with whom Justice Stevens joins,dissenting.

Respondent DeMont Conner is a prisoner in a maximum-security Hawaii prison. After Conner reacted angrily to a
strip search, a misconduct report charged him with obstruct-ing the performance of a correctional officer's duties, using
abusive language when talking to a staff member, and ha-rassing a staff member. Conner received notice of the
charges and had an opportunity, personally, to answer them.However, the disciplinary committee denied his request to
call as witnesses staff members he said would attest to hisinnocence.

Conner contested the misconduct charges, but, accordingto the report of the disciplinary committee, he admitted his
hesitation to follow orders and his use of profanity duringthe search. Based on Conner's statement to the committee,
and on written statements submitted by the officer who con-ducted the search and his supervisor, the committee found
Conner guilty of all charges. Sentenced to 30 days in theprison's segregation unit, Conner pursued an administrative
appeal, which ultimately resulted in reversal of the obstruc-tion conviction.

Unlike the Court, I conclude that Conner had a libertyinterest, protected by the Fourteenth Amendment's Due
Process Clause, in avoiding the disciplinary confinement heendured. As

Justice Breyer details, Conner's prisonpunishment effected a severe alteration in the conditions of

his incarceration. See post, at 494. Disciplinary confinetion Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment where appropriate, and may
draw upon internal prison grievance procedures and state judicial review
where available.

ment as punishment for "high misconduct" not only deprives
prisoners of privileges for protracted periods; unlike administrative segregation and protective custody, disciplinary
confinement also stigmatizes them and diminishes parole
prospects. Those immediate and lingering consequences
should suffice to qualify such confinement as liberty depriving for purposes of Due Process Clause protection. See
Meachum v. Fano, 427 U. S. 215, 234-235 (1976) (Stevens,
J., dissenting).1

I see the Due Process Clause itself, not Hawaii's prison
code, as the wellspring of the protection due Conner. Deriving protected liberty interests from mandatory language
in local prison codes would make of the fundamental right
something more in certain States, something less in others.
Liberty that may vary from Ossining, New York, to San
Quentin, California, does not resemble the "Liberty" enshrined among "unalienable Rights" with which all persons
are "endowed by their Creator." Declaration of Independence; see Meachum, 427 U. S., at 230 (Stevens, J., dissenting) ("[T]he Due Process Clause protects [the unalienable liberty recognized in the Declaration of Independence] rather

1 The Court reasons that Conner's disciplinary confinement, "with insignificant exceptions, mirrored th[e] conditions imposed upon inmates in administrative segregation and protective custody," ante, at 486, and therefore implicated no constitutional liberty interest. But discipline means
punishment for misconduct; it rests on a finding of wrongdoing that can
adversely affect an inmate's parole prospects. Disciplinary confinement
therefore cannot be bracketed with administrative segregation and protective custody, both measures that carry no long-term consequences.
The Court notes, however, that the State eventually expunged Conner's
disciplinary record, ibid., as a result of his successful administrative
appeal. But hindsight cannot tell us whether a liberty interest existed
at the outset. One must, of course, know at the start the character of
the interest at stake in order to determine then what process, if any, is
constitutionally due. "All's well that ends well" cannot be the measure
here.

Deriving the prisoner's due process right from the codefor his prison, moreover, yields this practical anomaly: a

State that scarcely attempts to control the behavior of itsprison guards may, for that very laxity, escape constitutional
accountability; a State that tightly cabins the discretion ofits prison workers may, for that attentiveness, become vulnerable to constitutional claims. An incentive for rulelessprison management disserves the State's penological goals
and jeopardizes the welfare of prisoners.To fit the liberty recognized in our fundamental instrument of government, the process due by reason of the Consti-tution similarly should not depend on the particularities of
the local prison's code. Rather, the basic, universal require-ments are notice of the acts of misconduct prison officials say
the inmate committed, and an opportunity to respond to thecharges before a trustworthy decisionmaker. See generally
Friendly, "Some Kind of Hearing," 123 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1267,1278-1281 (1975) (an unbiased tribunal, notice of the proposed government action and the grounds asserted for it,and an opportunity to present reasons why the proposed action should not be taken are fundamental; additional safe-guards depend on the importance of the private interest, the
utility of the particular safeguards, and the burden of afford-ing them).

2 The Court describes a category of liberty interest that is something
less than the one the Due Process Clause itself shields, something more
than anything a prison code provides. The State may create a liberty
interest, the Court tells us, when "atypical and significant hardship [would
be borne by] the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life."
Ante, at 484; see ante, at 486. What design lies beneath these key words?
The Court ventures no examples, leaving consumers of the Court's work
at sea, unable to fathom what would constitute an "atypical, significant
deprivation," ibid., and yet not trigger protection under the Due Process
Clause directly.

Breyer, J., dissenting
For the reasons Justice Breyer cogently presents, seepost, at 504, a return of this case to the District Court would

be unavoidable if it were recognized that Conner was de-prived of liberty within the meaning of the Due Process
Clause. But upon such a return, a renewed motion for sum-mary judgment would be in order, for the record, as currently composed, does not show that Conner was denied anyprocedural protection warranted in his case.

In particular, a call for witnesses is properly refused whenthe projected testimony is not relevant to the matter in controversy. See Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U. S. 539, 566 (1974)( justifications for a prison tribunal's refusing to hear witnesses are "irrelevance, lack of necessity, [and] the hazards[to institutional safety or correctional goals] presented in individual cases"). Unless Conner were to demonstrate, inface of the disciplinary committee's stated reliance on his
own admissions, that an issue of material fact is genuinely incontroversy, see Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 56(c), (e), his due process claim would fail. * * *

Because I conclude that Conner was deprived of libertywithin the meaning of the Due Process Clause, I dissent from
the judgment of the Court. I would return the case for aprecisely focused determination whether Conner received
the process that was indeed due.

I dissent. I

The respondent, DeMont Conner, is an inmate at HalawaCorrectional Facility, a maximum security prison in Hawaii.
In August 1987, as a result of an altercation with a guard,prison authorities charged Conner with violating several
prison disciplinary regulations, including one that prohibited"physical interference . . . resulting in the obstruction . . . of
the performance of a correctional function. . . ." Haw.Admin. Rule $ 17-201-7 (14) (1983). The prison's "adjustment committee" found Conner "guilty" and imposed apunishment of 30 days of "disciplinary segregation." Eventually, but after Conner had served the 30 days, a reviewofficial in the prison set aside the committee's determination,
and expunged it from Conner's record.In the meantime, Conner had brought this "civil rights"
action in Federal District Court in Hawaii. See Rev. Stat.$ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983. He claimed, among other things,
that the adjustment committee's failure to let him call cer-tain witnesses had deprived him of his "liberty . . . without
due process of law." U. S. Const., Amdt. 14, $ 1. The DistrictCourt granted summary judgment for the prison officials.
But, the Ninth Circuit agreed with Conner that the committee's punishment had deprived him of procedurally protected"liberty." 15 F. 3d 1463, 1466 (1993). It remanded the case

to the District Court to determine whether the refusal to
allow Conner to call the particular witnesses denied him ofthe process he was "due." See Part V,

infra.
The issue before this Court is whether Conner's par-ticular punishment amounted to a deprivation of Conner's

"liberty" within the meaning of the Due Process Clause.

II
The Fourteenth Amendment says that a State shall not"deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due

process of law." U. S. Const., Amdt. 14, $ 1. In determiningwhether state officials have deprived an inmate, such as Conner, of a procedurally protected "liberty," this Court tradi-tionally has looked either (1) to the nature of the deprivation
(how severe, in degree or kind) or (2) to the State's rulesgoverning the imposition of that deprivation (whether they,
in effect, give the inmate a "right" to avoid it). See, e. g.,Kentucky Dept. of Corrections v. Thompson, 490 U. S. 454,
460-461, 464-465 (1989). Thus, this Court has said that cer-tain changes in conditions may be so severe or so different
from ordinary conditions of confinement that, whether or notstate law gives state authorities broad discretionary power
to impose them, the state authorities may not do so "withoutcomplying with minimum requirements of due process."
Vitek v. Jones, 445 U. S. 480, 491-494 (1980) ("involuntarycommitment to a mental hospital");

Washington v. Harper,494 U. S. 210, 221-222 (1990) ("unwanted administration of

antipsychotic drugs"). The Court has also said that depriva-tions that are less severe or more closely related to the original terms of confinement nonetheless will amount to depriva-tions of procedurally protected liberty, provided that state
law (including prison regulations) narrowly cabins the legalpower of authorities to impose the deprivation (thereby giving the inmate a kind of right to avoid it). See Hewitt v.
Helms, 459 U. S. 460, 471-472 (1983) (liberty interest createdby regulations "requiring . . . that administrative segregation

will not occur absent specified substantive predicates");

and regulations"); Board of Pardons v. Allen, 482 U. S. 369,382 (1987) (

If we apply these general pre-existing principles to therelevant facts before us, it seems fairly clear, as the Ninth

Circuit found, that the prison punishment here at issue de-prived Conner of constitutionally protected "liberty." For
one thing, the punishment worked a fairly major change inConner's conditions. In the absence of the punishment,
Conner, like other inmates in Halawa's general prison population would have left his cell and worked, taken classes, or
mingled with others for eight hours each day. See Exh. 36,
App. 126; Exh. 6, id., at 101. As a result of disciplinary segregation, however, Conner, for 30 days, had to spend his entire time alone in his cell (with the exception of 50 minutes
each day on average for brief exercise and shower periods,
during which he nonetheless remained isolated from other
inmates and was constrained by leg irons and waist chains).
See Exh. 61, id., at 156-157, 166. Cf. Hughes v. Rowe, 449
U. S. 5, 9, 11 (1980) (per curiam) (disciplinary "[s]egregation
of a prisoner without a prior hearing may violate due process

by apprehended emergency conditions"); Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U. S. 539, 552, n. 9, 571-572, n. 19 (1974) ("solitary
confinement"--i. e., segregation "in the usual `disciplinary

conditions of confinement"); Baxter v. Palmigiano, 425 U. S.
308, 323 (1976) (segregation for " `serious misconduct' " triggers due process protection) (citation omitted).

Moreover, irrespective of whether this punishment
amounts to a deprivation of liberty independent of state law,
here the prison's own disciplinary rules severely cabin the
authority of prison officials to impose this kind of punishment. They provide (among other things):

(c) that, when an inmate is charged with such misconduct, then (after notice and a hearing) "[a] finding of
guilt shall be made" if the charged inmate admits guilt
or the "charge is supported by substantial evidence,"

$$ 17-201-18(b), (b)(2); see $$ 17-201-16, 17; and

(d) that the "[s]anctions" for high misconduct that
"may be imposed as punishment . . . shall include
. . . [d]isciplinary segregation up to thirty days,"

$ 17-201-7(b).

The prison rules thus: (1) impose a punishment that is substantial, (2) restrict its imposition as a punishment to instances in which an inmate has committed a defined offense,
and (3) prescribe nondiscretionary standards for determining
whether or not an inmate committed that offense. Accordingly, under this Court's liberty-defining standards, imposing
the punishment would "deprive" Conner of "liberty" within
the meaning of the Due Process Clause. Compare Hewitt v.
Helms, supra, at 471-472 (liberty interest created by regulations "requiring that . . . administrative segregation will not
occur absent specified substantive predicates"), with Thompson, 490 U. S., at 457, n. 2 (no liberty interest created by
regulations which gave officials broad discretion to refuse a
visit whenever "there are reasonable grounds to believe
that," among other things, "[t]he visit will be detrimental to
the inmate's rehabilitation"). Thus, under existing law, the
Ninth Circuit correctly decided that the punishment deprived Conner of procedurally protected liberty and that the
District Court should go on to decide whether or not the

Breyer, J., dissenting
prison's procedures provided Conner with the "process" that
is "due."

III

The majority, while not disagreeing with this summary
of pre-existing law, seeks to change, or to clarify, that law's
"liberty" defining standards in one important respect. The
majority believes that the Court's present "cabining of discretion" standard reads the Constitution as providing procedural protection for trivial "rights," as, for example, where
prison rules set forth specific standards for the content of
prison meals. Ante, at 482-483. It adds that this approach
involves courts too deeply in routine matters of prison administration, all without sufficient justification. Ante, at
482. It therefore imposes a minimum standard, namely, that
a deprivation falls within the Fourteenth Amendment's
definition of "liberty" only if it "imposes atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life." Ante, at 484, 486.

I am not certain whether or not the Court means this
standard to change prior law radically. If so, its generality
threatens the law with uncertainty, for some lower courts
may read the majority opinion as offering significantly less
protection against deprivation of liberty, while others may
find in it an extension of protection to certain "atypical"
hardships that pre-existing law would not have covered.
There is no need, however, for a radical reading of this standard, nor any other significant change in present law, to
achieve the majority's basic objective, namely, to read the
Constitution's Due Process Clause to protect inmates against
deprivations of freedom that are important, not comparatively insignificant. Rather, in my view, this concern simply
requires elaborating, and explaining, the Court's present
standards (without radical revision) in order to make clear
that courts must apply them in light of the purposes they
were meant to serve. As so read, the standards will not

Breyer, J., dissenting
create procedurally protected"liberty" interests where onlyminor matters are at stake.

Three sets of considerations, taken together, support myconclusion that the Court need not (and today's generally
phrased minimum standard therefore does not) significantly
revise current doctrine by deciding to remove minor prisonmatters from federal-court scrutiny. First, although this

Court has said, and continues to say, that some deprivationsof an inmate's freedom are so severe in kind or degree (or so
far removed from the original terms of confinement) thatthey amount to deprivations of liberty, irrespective of
whether state law (or prison rules) "cabin discretion," e. g.,
ante, at 483-484; Vitek v. Jones, 445 U. S., at 491-494; Washington v. Harper, 494 U. S., at 221-222; cf. Joint Anti-Fascist

Refugee Comm. v. McGrath, 341 U. S. 123, 168 (1951) (Frankfurter, J., concurring), it is not easy to specify just when, or
how much of, a loss triggers this protection. There is a
broad middle category of imposed restraints or deprivations
that, considered by themselves, are neither obviously so serious as to fall within, nor obviously so insignificant as to fall
without, the Clause's protection.

Second, the difficult line-drawing task that this middle category implies helps to explain why this Court developed its
additional liberty-defining standard, which looks to local law
(examining whether that local law creates a "liberty" by significantly limiting the discretion of local authorities to impose
a restraint). See, e. g., Thompson, supra, at 461; Hewitt, 459
U. S., at 471-472. Despite its similarity to the way in which
the Court determines the existence, or nonexistence, of
"property" for Due Process Clause purposes, the justification
for looking at local law is not the same in the prisoner liberty
context. In protecting property, the Due Process Clause
often aims to protect reliance, say, reliance upon an "entitlement" that local (i. e., nonconstitutional) law itself has created or helped to define. See Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, 408 U. S. 564, 577 (1972) ("It is a purpose of

515us2$80q 08-12-98 17:26:03 PAGES OPINPGT
498 SANDIN v. CONNER

Breyer, J., dissenting
the ancient institution of property to protect those claimsupon which people rely in their daily lives, reliance that must

not be arbitrarily undermined"). In protecting liberty, how-ever, the Due Process Clause protects, not this kind of reliance upon a government-conferred benefit, but rather an absence of government restraint, the very absence of restraintthat we call freedom. Cf.

Meachum, 427 U. S., at 230-231
(Stevens, J., dissenting) (citing Morrissey v. Brewer, 408U. S. 471, 482 (1972)).

Nevertheless, there are several other important reasons,in the prison context, to consider the provisions of state law.
The fact that a further deprivation of an inmate's freedom
takes place under local rules that cabin the authorities' discretionary power to impose the restraint suggests, other
things being equal, that the matter is more likely to have
played an important role in the life of the inmate. Cf. Hewitt, supra, at 488 (Stevens, J., dissenting). It suggests,
other things being equal, that the matter is more likely of a
kind to which procedural protections historically have applied, and where they normally prove useful, for such rules
often single out an inmate and condition a deprivation upon
the existence, or nonexistence, of particular facts. Cf.
Thompson, 490 U. S., at 468-470 (Marshall, J., dissenting);
United States v. Florida East Coast R. Co., 410 U. S. 224,
244-245 (1973). It suggests, other things being equal, that
the matter will not involve highly judgmental administrative
matters that call for the wise exercise of discretion--matters
where courts reasonably should hesitate to second-guess
prison administrators. See Meachum, supra, at 225. It
suggests, other things being equal, that the inmate will have
thought that he himself, through control of his own behavior,
could have avoided the deprivation, and thereby have believed that (in the absence of his misbehavior) the restraint
fell outside the "sentence imposed" upon him. Cf. Thompson, 490 U. S., at 464-465. Finally, courts can identify the
presence or absence of cabined discretion fairly easily and

499Cite as: 515 U. S. 472 (1995)
Breyer, J., dissenting
objectively, at least much of the time. Cf. id., at 461. Thesecharacteristics of "cabined discretion" mean that courts can

use it as a kind of touchstone that can help them, when theyconsider the broad middle category of prisoner restraints, to
separate those kinds of restraints that, in general, are more
likely to call for constitutionally guaranteed procedural pro-tection, from those that more likely do not. Given these reasons and the precedent, I believe courts will continue to findthis touchstone helpful as they seek to apply the majority's
middle category standard.Third, there is, therefore, no need to apply the "discretioncabining" approach--the basic purpose of which is to provide
a somewhat more objective method for identifying deprivations of protected "liberty" within a broad middle range of
prisoner restraints--where a deprivation is unimportant
enough (or so similar in nature to ordinary imprisonment)
that it rather clearly falls outside that middle category.
Prison, by design, restricts the inmates' freedom. And, one
cannot properly view unimportant matters that happen to be
the subject of prison regulations as substantially aggravating a loss that has already occurred. Indeed, a regulation
about a minor matter, for example, a regulation that seems
to cabin the discretionary power of a prison administrator to
deprive an inmate of, say, a certain kind of lunch, may
amount simply to an instruction to the administrator about
how to do his job, rather than a guarantee to the inmate of
a "right" to the status quo. Cf. Colon v. Schneider, 899 F. 2d
660, 668 (CA7 1990) (rules governing use of Mace to subdue
inmates "directed toward the prison staff, not the inmates").
Thus, this Court has never held that comparatively unimportant prisoner "deprivations" fall within the scope of the
Due Process Clause even if local law limits the authority of
prison administrators to impose such minor deprivations.
See Thompson, supra, at 461, n. 3 (leaving question open).
And, in my view, it should now simply specify that they do
not.

Breyer, J., dissenting
I recognize that, as a consequence, courts must separatethe unimportant from the potentially significant, without the

help of the more objective "discretion-cabining" test. Yet,making that judicial judgment seems no more difficult than
many other judicial tasks. See Goss v. Lopez, 419 U. S. 565,
576 (1975) ("de minimis" line defining property interestsunder the Due Process Clause). It seems to me possible to

separate less significant matters such as television privi-leges, "sack" versus "tray" lunches, playing the state lottery,
attending an ex-stepfather's funeral, or the limits of travelwhen on prison furlough,

e. g., Lyon v. Farrier, 727 F. 2d 766,
768-769 (CA8 1984); Burgin v. Nix, 899 F. 2d 733, 734-735
(CA8 1990) (per curiam); Hatch v. Sharp, 919 F. 2d 1266,
1270 (CA7 1990); Merritt v. Broglin, 891 F. 2d 169, 173-174
(CA7 1989); Segal v. Biller, No. 94-35448, 1994 U. S. App.
LEXIS 30628, *4-*5 (CA9, Oct. 31, 1994) (unpublished), from
more significant matters, such as the solitary confinement at
issue here. Indeed, prison regulations themselves may help
in this respect, such as the regulations here which separate
(from more serious matters) "low moderate" and "minor"
misconduct. Compare, on the one hand, the maximum punishment for "moderate" misconduct of two weeks of disciplinary segregation, Haw. Admin. Rule $ 17-201-8 (1983), with
the less severe maximum punishments, on the other hand,
for "low moderate" and "minor" misconduct, $$ 17-201-9, 10
(several hours of disciplinary segregation and "[l]oss of privileges" such as "community recreation; commissary; snacks;
cigarettes, smoking; personal visits--no longer than fifteen
days; personal correspondence; personal phone calls for not
longer than fifteen days"; impounding personal property;
extra duty; and reprimand).

The upshot is the following: the problems that the majority
identifies suggest that this Court should make explicit the
lower definitional limit, in the prison context, of "liberty"
under the Due Process Clause--a limit that is already implicit in this Court's precedent. See Morrissey v. Brewer,

The Court today reaffirms that the "liberty" protected bythe Fourteenth Amendment includes interests that state law

may create. Ante, at 483-484. It excludes relatively minormatters from that protection.

Ante, at 484 (requiring "atyp-ical and significant hardship on the inmate"). And, it does

not question the vast body of case law, including cases fromthis Court and every Circuit, recognizing that segregation
can deprive an inmate of constitutionally protected "liberty."See,

e. g., Hewitt, supra, at 472; Rodi v. Ventetuolo, 941 F. 2d22, 28 (CA1 1991); Soto v. Walker, 44 F. 3d 169, 172 (CA2

1995); Layton v. Beyer, 953 F. 2d 839, 849 (CA3 1992); Bakerv. Lyles, 904 F. 2d 925, 929 (CA4 1990); Dzana v. Foti, 829
F. 2d 558, 560-561 (CA5 1987); Mackey v. Dyke, 29 F. 3d 1086,1092 (CA6 1994); Alston v. DeBruyn, 13 F. 3d 1036, 1042-
1043 (CA7 1994); Brown v. Frey, 889 F. 2d 159, 166 (CA81989);

Walker v. Sumner, 14 F. 3d 1415, 1419 (CA9 1994);Reynoldson v. Shillinger, 907 F. 2d 124, 126-127 (CA10

1990); McQueen v. Tabah, 839 F. 2d 1525, 1528-1529 (CA111988); Lucas v. Hodges, 730 F. 2d 1493, 1504-1506 (CADC
1984). That being so, it is difficult to see why the Courtreverses, rather than affirms, the Court of Appeals in this
case.The majority finds that Conner's "discipline in segregated
confinement did not present" an "atypical, significant depri-vation" because of three special features of his case, taken
together. Ante, at 486. First, the punishment "mirrored"conditions imposed upon inmates in "administrative segregation and protective custody." Ibid. Second, Hawaii's

515us2$80q 08-12-98 17:26:03 PAGES OPINPGT
502 SANDIN v. CONNER

Breyer, J., dissenting
prison regulations give prison officials broad discretion toimpose these other forms of nonpunitive segregation. Ibid.

And, third, the State later "expunged Conner's disciplinaryrecord," thereby erasing any stigma and transforming Conner's segregation for violation of a specific disciplinary ruleinto the sort of "totally discretionar[y] confinement" that
would not have implicated a liberty interest. Ibid.I agree with the first two of the majority's assertions.
The conditions in administrative and disciplinary segregation
are relatively similar in Hawaii. Compare Exh. 60, App.142-143, 152, with Exh. 61, id., at 156-157, 166. And, the

rules governing administrative segregation do, indeed, pro-vide prison officials with broad leeway. See Haw. Admin.
Rule $ 17-201-22(3) (1983) ("Whenever . . . justifiable reasonsexist"). But, I disagree with the majority's assertion about
the relevance of the expungement. How can a later decisionof prison authorities transform Conner's segregation for a
violation of a specific disciplinary rule into a term of segre-gation under the administrative rules? How can a later
expungement restore to Conner the liberty that, in fact, hehad already lost? Because Conner was found guilty under
prison disciplinary rules, and was sentenced to solitaryconfinement under those rules, the Court should look to

those rules.In sum, expungement or no, Conner suffered a deprivation
that was significant, not insignificant. And, that deprivationtook place under disciplinary rules that, as described in Part
II, supra, do cabin official discretion sufficiently. I wouldtherefore hold that Conner was deprived of "liberty" within
the meaning of the Due Process Clause.

V
Other related legal principles, applicable here, should fur-ther alleviate the majority's fear that application of the Due

Process Clause to significant prison disciplinary action, see

Breyer, J., dissenting
Part III, supra, will lead federal courts to intervene improperly (as the majority sees it) "in the day-to-day management
of prisons, often squandering judicial resources with little
offsetting benefit to anyone." Ante, at 482. For one thing,
the "process" that is "due" in the context of prison discipline
is not the full blown procedure that accompanies criminal
trials. Rather, "due process" itself is a flexible concept,
which, in the context of a prison, must take account of the
legitimate needs of prison administration when deciding
what procedural elements basic considerations of fairness require. See, e. g., Goss v. Lopez, 419 U. S., at 578 (the " `very
nature of due process negates any concept of inflexible procedures universally applicable to every imaginable situation' ")
(quoting Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers v. McElroy, 367
U. S. 886, 895 (1961)); Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319, 334
(1976) (" `[D]ue process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands' ")
(quoting Morrissey v. Brewer, supra, at 481); Friendly,
"Some Kind of Hearing," 123 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1267, 1278 (1975)
("required degree of procedural safeguards varies"); Wolff,
418 U. S., at 563-567 (requiring--in addition to notice, some
kind of hearing, and written reasons for the decision--permission to call witnesses and to present documentary evidence when doing so "will not be unduly hazardous to institutional safety or correctional goals," id., at 566).

More importantly for present purposes, whether or not a
particular procedural element normally seems appropriate
to a certain kind of proceeding, the Due Process Clause does
not require process unless, in the individual case, there is a
relevant factual dispute between the parties. Just as courts
do not hold hearings when there is no "genuine" and "material" issue of fact in dispute between the parties, see Fed.
Rule Civ. Proc. 56 (summary judgment), so the Due Process
Clause does not entitle an inmate to additional disciplinary
hearing procedure (such as the calling of a witness) unless

515us2$80q 08-12-98 17:26:03 PAGES OPINPGT
504 SANDIN v. CONNER

Breyer, J., dissenting
there is a factual dispute (relevant to guilt) that the additional procedure might help to resolve, see Codd v. Velger,
429 U. S. 624, 627 (1977) (per curiam).

I mention this latter legal point both because it illustrates
a legal protection against the meritless case, and because a
review of the record before us indicates that, in this very
case, if we were to affirm, it would pose an important obstacle to Conner's eventual success. The record contains the
prison adjustment committee's report, which says that its
finding of guilt rests upon Conner's own admissions. The
committee wrote that it "based" its "decision" upon Conner's
"statements" that (when he was strip-searched) "he turned
around" and "looked at" the officer, he "then `eyed up' " the
officer, he "was hesitant to comply" with the strip-search instructions, he "dislikes" the officer, and he spoke an obscenity during the search process. App. to Pet. for Cert. A-67.
The record contains no explanation that we have found,
either in Conner's affidavits or elsewhere, of how the witnesses he wanted to call (or the other procedures that he
sought) could have led to any evidence relevant to the facts
at issue.

I note that the petitioner, in her petition for certiorari,
asked us, for this reason, to decide this case in her favor.
But, we cannot do so. Even were we to assume that this
question falls within the scope of the question we agreed to
answer, the record nonetheless reveals that the petitioner
did not ask for summary judgment on this basis. Thus, Conner has not had an opportunity to point to "specific facts"
that might explain why these witnesses (or other procedures)
were needed. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56(e) ("must set
forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for
trial"). Were this Court to affirm, the defense would remain
free to move for summary judgment on remand, and Conner
would have to respond with a specific factual showing in
order to avoid an adverse judgment.

Syllabus

UNITED STATES v. GAUDIN
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 94-514. Argued April 17, 1995--Decided June 19, 1995
Respondent was charged with violating 18 U. S. C. $ 1001 by making false

statements on Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)
loan documents. After instructing the jury that the Government had
to prove, inter alia, that the alleged false statements were material to
HUD's activities and decisions, the District Court added that the issue
of materiality is a matter for the court to decide rather than the jury
and that the statements in question were material. The jury convicted
respondent, but the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that taking the
question of materiality from the jury violated the Fifth and Sixth
Amendments.

Held: The trial judge's refusal to submit the question of "materiality" to

the jury was unconstitutional. Pp. 509-523.

(a) The Fifth and Sixth Amendments require criminal convictions to
rest upon a jury determination that the defendant is guilty of every
element of the crime with which he is charged. Sullivan v. Louisiana,
508 U. S. 275, 277-278. The Government concedes that "materiality"
is an element of the offense that the Government must prove under

$ 1001. Pp. 509-511.

(b) The question whether the defendant's statement was material to
the federal agency's decision is the sort of mixed question of law and
fact that has typically been resolved by juries. See, e. g., TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., 426 U. S. 438, 450. The Government's position that the principle requiring the jury to decide all of a crime's elements applies to only the essential elements' factual components has no
support in the case law. Sparf v. United States, 156 U. S. 51, 90, and
the other authorities on which the Government relies, e. g., Sullivan,
supra, at 275, all confirm that the jury's constitutional responsibility is
not merely to determine the facts, but to apply the law to those facts
and draw the ultimate conclusion of guilt or innocence. Pp. 511-515.

(c) There is no consistent historical tradition to support the Government's argument that, even if the jury generally must pass on all of a
crime's elements, there is an exception for materiality determinations
with respect to false statements in perjury prosecutions (which are analogous to the determinations made in $ 1001 prosecutions). There was
no clear practice of having the judge determine the materiality question

Opinion of the Court
in this country at or near the time the Bill of Rights was adopted. Indeed, state and federal cases appear not to have addressed the question
until the latter part of the 19th century, at which time they did not
display anything like the virtual unanimity claimed by the Government.
Though uniform postratification practice can shed light upon the meaning of an ambiguous constitutional provision, the practice here is not
uniform, and the core meaning of the constitutional guarantees is unambiguous. Pp. 515-519.

(d) The Government's contention that stare decisis requires respondent's constitutional claim to be denied is rejected. Sinclair v. United
States, 279 U. S. 263, 298, is overruled. Kungys v. United States, 485
U. S. 759, 772, distinguished. Pp. 519-523.

28 F. 3d 943, affirmed.

Scalia, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court. Rehnquist,
C. J., filed a concurring opinion, in which O'Connor and Breyer, JJ.,

SolicitorGeneral Days, Assistant Attorney General Harris, Richard

H. Seamon, and Kathleen A. Felton.Richard Hansen argued the cause for respondent. With
him on the brief were David Allen and Todd Maybrown.*

Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court.
In the trial at issue here, respondent was convicted ofmaking material false statements in a matter within the

jurisdiction of a federal agency, in violation of 18 U. S. C.$ 1001. The question presented is whether it was constitutional for the trial judge to refuse to submit the question of"materiality" to the jury.

508 UNITED STATES v. GAUDIN

Opinion of the Court
Housing Administration (FHA), an agency within the De-partment of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Respondent would purchase rental housing, renovate it, obtainan inflated appraisal, and sell it to a "straw buyer" (a friend
or relative), for whom respondent would arrange an FHAinsured mortgage loan. Then, as prearranged, respondentwould repurchase the property (at a small profit to the straw

buyer) and assume the mortgage loan. Twenty-nine ofthese ventures went into default.

Respondent was charged by federal indictment with,among other things, multiple counts of making false statements on federal loan documents in violation of 18 U. S. C.

$ 1001. Two of these counts charged that respondent had
made false statements on HUD/FHA form 92800-5 by knowingly inflating the appraised value of the mortgaged property. The other false-statement counts charged that respondent had made misrepresentations on HUD/FHA form
HUD-1, the settlement form used in closing the sales of the
properties. Line 303 of this form requires disclosure of the
closing costs to be paid or received by the borrower/ buyer
and the seller. The forms executed by respondent showed
that the buyer was to pay some of the closing costs, whereas
in fact he, the seller, had arranged to pay all of them. To
prove the materiality of these false statements, the Government offered the testimony of several persons charged with
administering FHA/HUD programs, who explained why the
requested information was important.

At the close of the evidence, the United States District
Court for the District of Montana instructed the jury that,
to convict respondent, the Government was required to
prove, inter alia, that the alleged false statements were material to the activities and decisions of HUD. But, the court
further instructed, "[t]he issue of materiality . . . is not submitted to you for your decision but rather is a matter for the
decision of the court. You are instructed that the statements charged in the indictment are material statements."

A panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit re-versed these convictions because Circuit precedent dictated
that materiality in a $ 1001 prosecution be decided by thejury. 997 F. 2d 1267 (1993). On rehearing en banc, the
Court of Appeals stood by this precedent. It held that tak-ing the question of materiality from the jury denied respondent a right guaranteed by the Fifth and Sixth Amendmentsto the United States Constitution. 28 F. 3d 943 (1994). We
granted certiorari. 513 U. S. 1071 (1995).

Section 1001 of Title 18 provides:

"Whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of anydepartment or agency of the United States knowingly

and willfully falsifies, conceals or covers up by any trick,scheme, or device a material fact, or makes any false,
fictitious or fraudulent statements or representations, ormakes or uses any false writing or document knowing
the same to contain any false, fictitious or fraudulentstatement or entry, shall be fined not more than $10,000
or imprisoned not more than five years, or both."
It is uncontested that conviction under this provision re-quires that the statements be "material" to the Government

inquiry, and that "materiality" is an element of the offensethat the Government must prove. The parties also agree on
the definition of "materiality": The statement must have "anatural tendency to influence, or [be] capable of influencing,
the decision of the decisionmaking body to which it was ad-dressed."

Kungys v. United States, 485 U. S. 759, 770 (1988)(internal quotation marks omitted). The question for our

resolution is whether respondent was entitled to have thiselement of the crime determined by the jury.

The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitutionguarantees that no one will be deprived of liberty without

Opinion of the Court
"due process of law"; and the Sixth, that "[i]n all criminalprosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy

and public trial, by an impartial jury." We have held thatthese provisions require criminal convictions to rest upon a
jury determination that the defendant is guilty of every ele-ment of the crime with which he is charged, beyond a reasonable doubt.1 Sullivan v. Louisiana, 508 U. S. 275, 277-278(1993). The right to have a jury make the ultimate determination of guilt has an impressive pedigree. Blackstone de-scribed "trial by jury" as requiring that "

the truth of everyaccusation, whether preferred in the shape of indictment,

information, or appeal, should afterwards be confirmed bythe unanimous suffrage of twelve of [the defendant's] equals
and neighbors . . . ." 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on theLaws of England 343 (1769) (emphasis added). Justice Story
wrote that the "trial by jury" guaranteed by the Constitu-tion was "generally understood to mean . . . a trial by a jury
of twelve men, impartially selected, who must unanimously
concur in the guilt of the accused before a legal convictioncan be had." 2 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution

of the United States 541, n. 2 (4th ed. 1873) (emphasis addedand deleted).

2 This right was designed "to guard against a

1 The "beyond a reasonable doubt" point is not directly at issue in the
present case, since it is unclear what standard of proof the District Court
applied in making its determination of materiality, and since the Ninth
Circuit's reversal of the District Court's judgment did not rest upon the
standard used but upon the failure to submit the question to the jury. It
is worth noting, however, that some courts which regard materiality as a
"legal" question for the judge do not require the higher burden of proof.
See, e. g., United States v. Gribben, 984 F. 2d 47, 51 (CA2 1993); United
States v. Chandler, 752 F. 2d 1148, 1151 (CA6 1985).

2 We held in Williams v. Florida, 399 U. S. 78 (1970), that the 12-person

requirement to which Story referred is not an indispensable component of
the right to trial by jury. But in so doing we emphasized that the jury's
determination of ultimate guilt is indispensable. The "essential feature
of a jury," we said, is "the interposition between the accused and his accuser of the commonsense judgment of a group of laymen . . . [in] that
group's determination of guilt or innocence." Id., at 100. See also Apo515us2$81k 08-25-98 19:26:11 PAGES OPINPGT

spirit of oppression and tyranny on the part of rulers," and"was from very early times insisted on by our ancestors in

the parent country, as the great bulwark of their civil andpolitical liberties." Id., at 540-541. See also Duncan v.
Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 151-154 (1968) (tracing the historyof trial by jury).

III
Thus far, the resolution of the question before us seemssimple. The Constitution gives a criminal defendant the

right to demand that a jury find him guilty of all the ele-ments of the crime with which he is charged; one of the
elements in the present case is materiality; respondenttherefore had a right to have the jury decide materiality.
To escape the force of this logic, the Government offersessentially three arguments. Having conceded the minor
premise--that materiality is an element of the offense--theGovernment argues first, that the major premise is flawed;
second, that (essentially) a page of history is worth a volumeof logic, and uniform practice simply excludes the element of
materiality from the syllogism; and third, that stare decisisrequires the judgment here to be reversed.

A
As to the first, the Government's position is that "material-ity," whether as a matter of logic or history, is a "legal" question, and that although we have sometimes spoken of "re-quiring the jury to decide `all the elements of a criminal
offense,' e. g., Estelle v. McGuire, [502 U. S. 62, 69] (1991);see Victor v. Nebraska, [511 U. S. 1, 5] (1994); Patterson v.
New York, 432 U. S. 197, 210 (1977), the principle actuallyapplies to

only the factual components of the essential ele-ments." Brief for United States 33 (emphasis added). The

Government claims that this understanding of the jury's role
daca v. Oregon, 406 U. S. 404 (1972) (plurality opinion) (applying similar
analysis to conclude that jury unanimity is not constitutionally required).

515us2$81k 08-25-98 19:26:11 PAGES OPINPGT
512 UNITED STATES v. GAUDIN

Opinion of the Court
dates back to Sparf v. United States, 156 U. S. 51 (1895), andis reaffirmed by recent decisions of this Court.

By limiting the jury's constitutionally prescribed roleto "the factual components of the essential elements" the
Government surely does not mean to concede that the jury
must pass upon all elements that contain some factual com-ponent, for that test is amply met here. Deciding whether a

statement is "material" requires the determination of atleast two subsidiary questions of purely historical fact: (a)
"what statement was made?" and (b) "what decision wasthe agency trying to make?" The ultimate question: (c)
"whether the statement was material to the decision," requires applying the legal standard of materiality (quoted
above) to these historical facts. What the Government apparently argues is that the Constitution requires only that
(a) and (b) be determined by the jury, and that (c) may be
determined by the judge. We see two difficulties with this.
First, the application-of-legal-standard-to-fact sort of question posed by (c), commonly called a "mixed question of law
and fact," has typically been resolved by juries. See J.
Thayer, Preliminary Treatise on Evidence at Common Law
194, 249-250 (1898). Indeed, our cases have recognized in
other contexts that the materiality inquiry, involving as it
does "delicate assessments of the inferences a `reasonable
[decisionmaker]' would draw from a given set of facts and
the significance of those inferences to him, . . . [is] peculiarly
on[e] for the trier of fact." TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., 426 U. S. 438, 450 (1976) (securities fraud); McLanahan v. Universal Ins. Co., 1 Pet. 170, 188-189, 191 (1828)
(materiality of false statements in insurance applications).

The second difficulty with the Government's position is
that it has absolutely no historical support. If it were true,
the lawbooks would be full of cases, regarding materiality
and innumerable other "mixed-law-and-fact" issues, in which
the criminal jury was required to come forth with "findings
of fact" pertaining to each of the essential elements, leaving

Opinion of the Court
it to the judge to apply the law to those facts and render theultimate verdict of "guilty" or "not guilty." We know of no

such case. Juries at the time of the framing could not beforced to produce mere "factual findings," but were entitled
to deliver a general verdict pronouncing the defendant's guilt
or innocence. Morgan, A Brief History of Special Verdictsand Special Interrogatories, 32 Yale L. J. 575, 591 (1922).

See also G. Clementson, Special Verdicts and Special Find-ings by Juries 49 (1905); Alschuler & Deiss, A Brief History
of the Criminal Jury in the United States, 61 U. Chi. L. Rev.867, 912-913 (1994). Justice Chase's defense to one of the
charges in his 1805 impeachment trial was that "he well
knows, that it is the right of juries in criminal cases, to give
a general verdict of acquittal, which cannot be set aside on
account of its being contrary to law, and that hence results
the power of juries, to decide on the law as well as on the
facts, in all criminal cases. This power he holds to be a
sacred part of our legal privileges . . . ." 1 S. Smith &
T. Lloyd, Trial of Samuel Chase 34 (1805).

Sparf, supra, the case on which the Government relies,
had nothing to do with the issue before us here. The question there was whether the jury could be deprived of the
power to determine, not only historical facts, not only mixed
questions of fact and law, but pure questions of law in a
criminal case. As the foregoing quotation from Justice
Chase suggests, many thought the jury had such power.
See generally Alschuler & Deiss, supra, at 902-916. We decided that it did not. In criminal cases, as in civil, we held,
the judge must be permitted to instruct the jury on the law
and to insist that the jury follow his instructions. 156 U. S.,
at 105-106. But our decision in no way undermined the historical and constitutionally guaranteed right of criminal defendants to demand that the jury decide guilt or innocence
on every issue, which includes application of the law to the
facts. To the contrary, Justice Harlan, writing for the
Court, explained the many judicial assertions of the jury's

514 UNITED STATES v. GAUDIN

Opinion of the Court
right to determine both law and fact as expressions of "the
principle, that when the question is compounded of law and
fact, a general verdict, ex necessitate, disposes of the case in
hand, both as to law and fact." Id., at 90 (emphasis in original). He gave as an example the 1807 treason trial of Aaron
Burr in which Chief Justice Marshall charged the jury that
" `levying war is an act compounded of law and fact; of which
the jury, aided by the court must judge. . . . [And] hav[ing]
now heard the opinion of the court on the law of the case[,]
[t]hey will apply that law to the facts, and will find a verdict
of guilty or not guilty as their own consciences may direct.' "
Id., at 67 (quoting 2 Burr's Trial 548, 550 (D. Robertson ed.
1875)) (emphasis in original). Other expressions of the same
principle abound. See United States v. Battiste, 24 F. Cas.
1042, 1043 (No. 14,545) (CC Mass. 1835) (Story, J., sitting as
Circuit Justice) (the jury's general verdict is "necessarily
compounded of [both] law and fact"). As Thayer wrote at
the end of the 19th century: "From the beginning . . . it was
perceived that any general verdict, such as . . . not guilty,
involved a conclusion of law, and that the jury did, in a sense,
in such cases answer a question of law." Thayer, supra, at
253.

The more modern authorities the Government cites also
do not support its concept of the criminal jury as mere factfinder. Although each contains language discussing the
jury's role as factfinder, see Sullivan v. Louisiana, 508 U. S.
275 (1993); Court of Ulster Cty. v. Allen, 442 U. S. 140, 156
(1979); Patterson v. New York, 432 U. S. 197, 206 (1977); In
re Winship, 397 U. S. 358, 364 (1970), each also confirms that
the jury's constitutional responsibility is not merely to determine the facts, but to apply the law to those facts and draw
the ultimate conclusion of guilt or innocence. The point is
put with unmistakable clarity in Allen, which involved the
constitutionality of statutory inferences and presumptions.
Such devices, Allen said, can help

515Cite as: 515 U. S. 506 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
"the trier of fact to determine the existence of an ele-ment of the crime--that is, an `ultimate' or `elemental'

fact--from the existence of one or more `evidentiary' or`basic' facts . . . . Nonetheless, in criminal cases, the
ultimate test of any device's constitutional validity in agiven case remains constant: the device must not undermine the factfinder's responsibility at trial, based on evi-dence adduced by the State, to find the

ultimate factsbeyond a reasonable doubt." Allen, supra, at 156.

See also Sullivan, supra, at 277 ("The right [to jury trial]includes, of course, as its most important element, the right
to have the jury, rather than the judge, reach the requisitefinding of `guilty' "); Patterson, supra, at 204; Winship,
supra, at 361, 363. B

The Government next argues that, even if the jury is gen-erally entitled to pass on all elements of a crime, there is a
historical exception for materiality determinations in per-jury prosecutions. We do not doubt that historical practice
is relevant to what the Constitution means by such conceptsas trial by jury, see

Murray's Lessee v. Hoboken Land &Improvement Co., 18 How. 272, 276-277 (1856); Holland v.

Illinois, 493 U. S. 474, 481 (1990), and it is precisely historicalpractice that we have relied on in concluding that the jury
must find all the elements. The existence of a unique his-torical exception to this principle--and an exception that
reduces the power of the jury precisely when it is mostimportant,

i. e., in a prosecution not for harming anotherindividual, but for offending against the Government itself--

would be so extraordinary that the evidence for it wouldhave to be convincing indeed. It is not so.

The practice of having courts determine the materiality offalse statements in perjury prosecutions is neither as old, nor
as uniform, as the Government suggests. In England, nopre-Revolution cases appear to have addressed the question,

516 UNITED STATES v. GAUDIN

Opinion of the Court
and the judges reached differing results when the issuefinally arose in the mid-19th century. Compare

Queen v.
Lavey, 3 Car. & K. 26, 30, 175 Eng. Rep. 448, 450 (Q. B. 1850)(materiality is a jury question),

Queen v. Goddard, 2 F. & F.
361, 175 Eng. Rep. 1096 (1861) (same), with Queen v. Courtney, 5 Ir. C. L. 434, 439 (Ct. Crim. App. 1856) (dictum) (mate-riality is a question for the judge);

Queen v. Gibbon, Le. &
Ca. 109, 113-114, 169 Eng. Rep. 1324, 1326 (1861) (same). Itwas not until 1911, 120 years after the adoption of our Bill of

Rights, that the rule the Government argues for was finallyadopted in England--not by judicial decision but by Act of
Parliament. See Perjury Act of 1911, $ 1(6), 1 & 2 Geo. V,
ch. 6.

Much more importantly, there was also no clear practice
of having the judge determine the materiality question in
this country at or near the time the Bill of Rights was
adopted. The Government cites Power v. Price, 16 Wend.
450 (N. Y. 1836), as "[t]he earliest reported case on the question" whether "materiality in perjury prosecutions is a question for the court rather than the jury," claiming that there
"New York's highest court held that a trial judge had correctly reserved the question of materiality to itself." Brief
for United States 18. Power held nothing even close to this.
Power was not a perjury case; indeed, it was not even a criminal prosecution. It was a civil action in which Price sued
Power for the slander of imputing to him the crime of perjury. The Court of Appeals held that Price did not need to
prove the materiality of the alleged false statement in order
to make out a prima facie case; but that Power could raise
immateriality as an affirmative defense negating intent to
impute perjury. 16 Wend., at 455-456. It then said that
the trial court "was clearly right in instructing the jury that
the testimony given on the former trial was proved to be
material," since "it merely decided a question of law, arising
upon the proof of facts as to which there was no dispute or
contrariety of testimony." Id., at 456. But the courts'

Opinion of the Court
power to resolve mixed-law-and-fact questions in civil casesis not at issue here; civil and criminal juries' required roles

are obviously not identical, or else there could be no directedverdicts for civil plaintiffs. The other early case relied upon
by the Government, Steinman v. McWilliams, 6 Pa. 170,
177-178 (1847), another slander case, is inapt for the samereason. The earliest American case involving the point that

we have been able to find places the Government itself inopposition to its position here. In

United States v. Cowing,
25 F. Cas. 680, 681 (No. 14,880) (CC DC 1835), the UnitedStates argued that materiality in a perjury prosecution was

a matter for the jury's consideration, citing an unpublished
decision of the General Court of Virginia. The federal
court, however, did not address the issue.

State and federal cases appear not to have addressed the
question until the latter part of the 19th century, at which
time they do not display anything like the "virtual unanimity" claimed by the Government. Brief for United States
18. Some of the opinions cited by the Government, asserting that materiality was a question of "law" for the judge,
appear to have involved either demurrers to the indictment
or appeals from convictions in which the case for materiality
was so weak that no reasonable juror could credit it--so that
even on our view of the matter the case should not have gone
to the jury. (The prosecution's failure to provide minimal
evidence of materiality, like its failure to provide minimal
evidence of any other element, of course raises a question of
"law" that warrants dismissal.) See, e. g., United States v.
Shinn, 14 F. 447, 452 (CC Ore. 1882); United States v. Singleton, 54 F. 488, 489 (SD Ala. 1892); United States v. Bedgood,
49 F. 54, 60 (SD Ala. 1891); Nelson v. State, 32 Ark. Rep. 192,
195 (1877). And some of the other cited cases involve the
convicted defendant's claim that materiality should not have
been decided by the jury, so that even if the issue was not
one of the prosecution's failure to make a threshold case, it
did not arise in a context in which the defendant's right to

Opinion of the Court
jury trial was at issue. See, e. g., Cothran v. State, 39 Miss.541, 547 (1860);

State v. Williams, 30 Mo. 364, 367 (1860);
State v. Lewis, 10 Kan. 157, 160 (1872); People v. Lem You,97 Cal. 224, 228-230, 32 P. 11, 12 (1893);

Thompson v. People,
26 Colo. 496, 504, 59 P. 51, 54-55 (1899); Barnes v. State, 15
Ohio C. C. 14, 25-26 (1897).Even assuming, however, that all the Government's lasthalf-of-the-19th-century cases fully stand for the propositionthat the defendant has no right to jury determination of materiality, there are cases that support the other view. See
Commonwealth v. Grant, 116 Mass. 17, 20 (1874); Lawrence
v. State, 2 Tex. Crim. 479, 483-484 (1877); State v. Spencer,
45 La. Ann. 1, 11-12, 12 So. 135, 138 (1893); Young v. People,
134 Ill. 37, 42, 24 N. E. 1070, 1071 (1890) (approving the treatment of materiality as "a mixed question of law and fact,
and thus one for the jury"). At most there had developed a
division of authority on the point, as the treatise writers of
the period amply demonstrate. Bishop in 1872 took the position that "[p]ractically, . . . the whole subject is to be passed
upon by the jury, under instructions from the judge, as involving, like most other cases, mixed questions of law and of
fact." 2 J. Bishop, Commentaries on Law of Criminal Procedure $ 935, p. 508 (2d ed.). May's 1881 treatise reported that
"[w]hether materiality is a question of law for the court or
of fact for a jury, is a point upon which the authorities are
about equally divided." J. May, Law of Crimes $ 188, p. 205.
Greenleaf, writing in 1883, sided with Bishop ("It seems that
the materiality of the matter assigned is a question for the
jury"), 3 S. Greenleaf, Law of Evidence $ 195, p. 189, n. (b)
(14th ed.)--but two editions later, in 1899, said that the question was one for the judge, 3 S. Greenleaf, Law of Evidence

$ 195, p. 196, n. 2 (16th ed.).

In sum, we find nothing like a consistent historical tradition supporting the proposition that the element of materiality in perjury prosecutions is to be decided by the judge.
Since that proposition is contrary to the uniform general un515us2$81k 08-25-98 19:26:11 PAGES OPINPGT

519Cite as: 515 U. S. 506 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
derstanding (and we think the only understanding consistentwith principle) that the Fifth and Sixth Amendments require

conviction by a jury of all elements of the crime, we mustreject those cases that have embraced it. Though uniform
postratification practice can shed light upon the meaning ofan ambiguous constitutional provision, the practice here is
not uniform, and the core meaning of the constitutional guar-antees is unambiguous.

C
The Government's final argument is that the principle ofstare decisis requires that we deny respondent's constitutional claim, citing our decision in Sinclair v. United States,279 U. S. 263 (1929). That case is not controlling in the
strictest sense, since it involved the assertion of a SixthAmendment right to have the jury determine, not "materiality" under $ 1001, but rather "pertinency" under that provi-sion of Title 2 making it criminal contempt of Congress to
refuse to answer a "question pertinent to [a] question under[congressional] inquiry," Rev. Stat. $ 102, 2 U. S. C. $ 192.
The two questions are similar, however, and the essentialargument made by respondent here was made by appellant
in that case, who sought reversal of his conviction because ofthe trial court's failure to submit the question of pertinency
to the jury: "[I]t has been said over and over again, thatevery essential ingredient of the crime must be proven to
the satisfaction of the jury beyond a reasonable doubt."Brief for Appellant in Sinclair v. United States, O. T. 1928,
No. 555, p. 109; 279 U. S., at 277 (argument for appellant).Though we did not address the constitutional argument explicitly, we held that the question of pertinency was "rightlydecided by the court as one of law."

Id., at 298. And tyingthe case even closer to the present one was our dictum that

pertinency "is not essentially different from . . . materialityof false testimony," which "when an element in the crime of
perjury, is one for the court." Ibid. Thus, while Sinclairis not strictly controlling, it is fair to say that we cannot hold

520 UNITED STATES v. GAUDIN

Opinion of the Court
for respondent today while still adhering to the reasoningand the holding of that case.

But the reasoning of Sinclair has already been repudiatedin a number of respects. The opinion rested upon the assumption that "pertinency" is a pure question of law--that
is, it does "not depend upon the probative value of evidence."
Ibid. We contradicted that assumption in Deutch v. United
States, 367 U. S. 456 (1961), reversing a conviction under$ 192 because "the Government at the trial failed to carry its

burden of proving the pertinence of the questions." Id., at469. Though it had introduced documentary and testimonial
evidence "to show the subject of the subcommittee's inquiry," it had failed to provide evidence to support the conclusion that the petitioner's false statement was pertinent to
that subject.

Our holding in Sinclair rested also upon the assertion that
"[i]t would be incongruous and contrary to well-established
principles to leave the determination of [the] matter [of pertinency] to a jury," 279 U. S., at 299, citing ICC v. Brimson,
154 U. S. 447, 489 (1894), and Horning v. District of Columbia, 254 U. S. 135 (1920). Both the cases cited to support
that assertion have since been repudiated. Brimson's holding that no right to jury trial attaches to criminal contempt
proceedings was overruled in Bloom v. Illinois, 391 U. S.
194, 198-200 (1968). Horning's holding that it was harmless
error, if error at all, for a trial judge effectively to order the
jury to convict, see 254 U. S., at 138, has been proved an
unfortunate anomaly in light of subsequent cases. See
Quercia v. United States, 289 U. S. 466, 468, 472 (1933); Bihn
v. United States, 328 U. S. 633, 637-639 (1946).

Other reasoning in Sinclair, not yet repudiated, we repudiate now. It said that the question of pertinency "may be
likened to those concerning relevancy at the trial of issues
in court," which "is uniformly held [to be] a question of law"
for the court. 279 U. S., at 298. But how relevancy is
treated for purposes of determining the admissibility of evi515us2$81k 08-25-98 19:26:11 PAGES OPINPGT

521Cite as: 515 U. S. 506 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
dence says nothing about how relevancy should be treatedwhen (like "pertinence" or "materiality") it is made an element of a criminal offense. It is commonplace for the samemixed question of law and fact to be assigned to the court
for one purpose, and to the jury for another. The question
of probable cause to conduct a search, for example, is re-solved by the judge when it arises in the context of a motion

to suppress evidence obtained in the search; but by the jurywhen it is one of the elements of the crime of depriving a
person of constitutional rights under color of law, see 18U. S. C. $$ 241-242. Cf.

United States v. McQueeney, 674
F. 2d 109, 114 (CA1 1982); United States v. Barker, 546 F. 2d
940, 947 (CADC 1976).

That leaves as the sole prop for Sinclair its reliance upon
the unexamined proposition, never before endorsed by this
Court, that materiality in perjury cases (which is analogous
to pertinence in contempt cases) is a question of law for the
judge. But just as there is nothing to support Sinclair except that proposition, there is, as we have seen, nothing to
support that proposition except Sinclair. While this perfect circularity has a certain esthetic appeal, it has no logic.
We do not minimize the role that stare decisis plays in our
jurisprudence. See Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491
U. S. 164, 172 (1989). That role is somewhat reduced, however, in the case of a procedural rule such as this, which
does not serve as a guide to lawful behavior. See Payne v.
Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 828 (1991). It is reduced all the
more when the rule is not only procedural but rests upon an
interpretation of the Constitution. See ibid. And we think
stare decisis cannot possibly be controlling when, in addition
to those factors, the decision in question has been proved
manifestly erroneous, and its underpinnings eroded, by subsequent decisions of this Court. Rodriguez de Quijas v.
Shearson/American Express, Inc., 490 U. S. 477, 480-481
(1989); Andrews v. Louisville & Nashville R. Co., 406 U. S.

522 UNITED STATES v. GAUDIN

Opinion of the Court
The Government also claims stare decisis benefit from ourdecision in Kungys v. United States, 485 U. S. 759 (1988),

which held that, in appellate review of a District Court (non-jury) denaturalization proceeding, the appellate court's
newly asserted standard of materiality could be applied tothe facts by the appellate court itself, rather than requiring
remand to the District Court for that application. Id., at772. But as we have observed, the characterization of a
mixed question of law and fact for one purpose does not gov-ern its characterization for all purposes. It is hard to imagine questions more diverse than, on the one hand, whetheran appellate court must remand to a district court for a determination of materiality in a denaturalization proceeding(Kungys) and, on the other hand, whether the Constitution
requires the finding of the element of materiality in a crimi-nal prosecution to be made by the jury (the present case).
It can be argued that Kungys itself did not heed this advice,since it relied upon both our prior decision in Sinclair, see
485 U. S., at 772, and a decision of the United States Courtof Appeals for the Sixth Circuit holding that materiality in a

$ 1001 prosecution is a question of " `law' " for the court, ibid.(quoting

United States v. Abadi, 706 F. 2d 178, 180, cert. de-nied, 464 U. S. 821 (1983)). But the result in Kungys could

be thought to follow a fortiori from the quite different casesof Sinclair and Abadi, whereas nonentitlement under the
Sixth Amendment to a jury determination cannot possiblybe thought to follow

a fortiori from Kungys. In any event,Kungys assuredly did not involve an adjudication to which

the Sixth Amendment right to jury trial attaches, see Luriav. United States, 231 U. S. 9 (1913), and hence had no reason
to explore the constitutional ramifications of Sinclair andAbadi, as we do today. Whatever support it gave to the
validity of those decisions was obiter dicta, and may properlybe disregarded.

of every element of the crime with which he is charged. Thetrial judge's refusal to allow the jury to pass on the "materiality" of Gaudin's false statements infringed that right. Thejudgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.

It is so ordered.
Chief Justice Rehnquist, with whom Justice O'Connor and Justice Breyer join, concurring.

I join the Court's opinion. "A person when first chargedwith a crime is entitled to a presumption of innocence, and

may insist that his guilt be established beyond a reasonabledoubt. In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358 (1970)." Herrera v.
Collins, 506 U. S. 390, 398 (1993). As a result, "[t]he prose-cution bears the burden of proving all elements of the offense
charged and must persuade the factfinder `beyond a reason-able doubt' of the facts necessary to establish each of those
elements." Sullivan v. Louisiana, 508 U. S. 275, 277-278(1993) (citations omitted); see also

Estelle v. McGuire, 502U. S. 62, 69 (1991) ("[T]he prosecution must prove all the

elements of a criminal offense beyond a reasonable doubt").The Government has conceded that 18 U. S. C. $ 1001 requires that the false statements made by respondent be "ma-terial" to the Government inquiry, and that "materiality" is
an element of the offense that the Government must prove inorder to sustain a conviction.

Ante, at 509; Brief for UnitedStates 11. The Government also has not challenged the

Court of Appeals' determination that the error it identifiedwas structural and plain. See id., at 8, n. 5; see also 28 F.
3d 943, 951-952 (CA9 1994). In light of these concessions, Iagree that "[t]he trial judge's refusal to allow the jury to pass
on the `materiality' of Gaudin's false statements infringed"his "right to have a jury determine, beyond a reasonable
doubt, his guilt of every element of the crime with which he[was] charged."

Ante, at 522 and this page.I write separately to point out that there are issues in this

area of the law which, though similar to those decided in

524 UNITED STATES v. GAUDIN

Rehnquist, C. J., concurring
the Court's opinion, are not disposed of by the Court today.There is a certain syllogistic neatness about what we do decide: Every element of an offense charged must be provedto the satisfaction of the jury beyond a reasonable doubt;
"materiality" is an element of the offense charged under

$ 1001; therefore, the jury, not the court, must decide theissue of materiality. But the Government's concessions

have made this case a much easier one than it might other-wise have been.

Whether "materiality" is indeed an element of every of-fense under 18 U. S. C. $ 1001 is not at all obvious from its
text. Section 1001 of Title 18 provides:

"Whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of any
department or agency of the United States knowinglyand willfully falsifies, conceals or covers up by any trick,

scheme, or device a material fact, or makes any false,fictitious or fraudulent statements or representations, or
makes or uses any false writing or document knowing
the same to contain any false, fictitious or fraudulentstatement or entry, shall be fined not more than $10,000

or imprisoned not more than five years, or both."
Currently, there is a conflict among the Courts of Appealsover whether materiality is an element of the offense created

by the second clause of $ 1001. Compare, e. g., United States
v. Corsino, 812 F. 2d 26, 30 (CA1 1987) (" `While materialityis not an explicit requirement of the second, false statements,

clause of $ 1001, courts have inferred a judge-made limitationof materiality in order to exclude trifles from its coverage' "),
with United States v. Elkin, 731 F. 2d 1005, 1009 (CA2 1984)
("It is settled in this Circuit that materiality is not an element of the offense of making a false statement in violation
of $ 1001"). The Court does not resolve that conflict; rather,
it merely assumes that materiality is, in fact, an element of
the false statement clause of $ 1001. Ante, at 511; cf. Sullivan, supra, at 278, n. (assuming that reasonable-doubt jury

Rehnquist, C. J., concurring
instruction was erroneous in light of the "question presentedand the State's failure to raise this issue below").

As with many aspects of statutory construction, determi-nation of what elements constitute a crime often is subject
to dispute. See, e. g., National Organization for Women,
Inc. v. Scheidler, 510 U. S. 249, 262 (1994) (holding that"RICO contains no economic motive requirement");

United
States v. Culbert, 435 U. S. 371, 380 (1978) (declining to limitthe Hobbs Act's scope to an undefined category of conduct

termed "racketeering"). "[I]n determining what facts mustbe proved beyond a reasonable doubt the [legislature's] definition of the elements of the offense is usually dispositive."
McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U. S. 79, 85 (1986). Nothing
in the Court's decision stands as a barrier to legislatures that
wish to define--or that have defined--the elements of their
criminal laws in such a way as to remove issues such as materiality from the jury's consideration. We have noted that
" `[t]he definition of the elements of a criminal offense is entrusted to the legislature, particularly in the case of federal
crimes, which are solely creatures of statute.' " Staples v.
United States, 511 U. S. 600, 604 (1994) (quoting Liparota v.
United States, 471 U. S. 419, 424 (1985)); see also McMillan,
supra, at 85. Within broad constitutional bounds, legislatures have flexibility in defining the elements of a criminal
offense. See Patterson v. New York, 432 U. S. 197, 210
(1977). Federal and state legislatures may reallocate burdens of proof by labeling elements as affirmative defenses,
ibid., or they may convert elements into "sentencing factor[s]" for consideration by the sentencing court, McMillan,
supra, at 85-86. The Court today does not resolve what
role materiality plays under $ 1001.

The Court properly acknowledges that other mixed questions of law and fact remain the proper domain of the trial
court. Ante, at 520-521. Preliminary questions in a trial
regarding the admissibility of evidence, Fed. Rule Evid.
104(a), the competency of witnesses, ibid., the voluntariness

of confessions, Crane v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 683, 688-689(1986), the legality of searches and seizures, Fed. Rule Crim.

Proc. 12(b)(3), and the propriety of venue, see Fed. RuleCrim. Proc. 18, may be decided by the trial court.

Finally, the Government has not argued here that the
error in this case was either harmless or not plain. Brief forUnited States 8, n. 5. As to the former, there is a "strong

presumption" that a constitutional violation will be subjectto harmless-error analysis. See

Rose v. Clark, 478 U. S. 570,
579 (1986). Accordingly, "the Court has applied harmless-error analysis to a wide range of errors and has recognized

that most constitutional errors can be harmless." Arizona
v. Fulminante, 499 U. S. 279, 306 (1991); cf. id., at 309-310
(listing examples of structural errors). In particular, the
Court has subjected jury instructions plagued by constitutional error to harmless-error analysis. See, e. g., Yates v.
Evatt, 500 U. S. 391, 402 (1991) (taint of an unconstitutional
burden-shifting jury instruction subject to harmless-error
analysis); Carella v. California, 491 U. S. 263, 266 (1989) (per
curiam) ( jury instruction containing an erroneous mandatory presumption subject to harmless-error analysis); Pope
v. Illinois, 481 U. S. 497, 502-504 (1987) ( jury instruction
misstating an element of an offense subject to harmless-error
analysis); Rose, supra, at 581-582 ( jury instruction containing an erroneous rebuttable presumption subject to
harmless-error analysis); but see Sullivan, 508 U. S., at 280-
282 (erroneous burden of proof instruction not subject to
harmless-error analysis). The Court today has no occasion
to review the Court of Appeals' conclusion that the constitutional error here "cannot be harmless." 28 F. 3d, at 951.

As to the latter, in United States v. Olano, 507 U. S. 725,
732 (1993), the Court noted the limitations on "plain error"
review by the courts of appeals under Rule 52(b). "The first
limitation on appellate authority under Rule 52(b) is that
there indeed be an `error.' " Ibid. Second, "the error
[must] be `plain.' " Id., at 734. Thus, "[a]t a minimum, a

court of appeals cannot correct an error pursuant to Rule52(b) unless the error is clear under current law." Ibid.

Third, the plain error must " `affec[t] substantial rights,' "ibid., i. e., "in most cases it means that the error must have
been prejudicial," ibid. Finally, if these three prerequisitesare met, the decision to correct forfeited error remains
within the sound discretion of the court of appeals. A courtof appeals, however, should not exercise that discretion unless the error " ` "seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity orpublic reputation of judicial proceedings." ' "

Id., at 732.In affirming the Court of Appeals, the Court concludes

that "it is fair to say that we cannot hold for respondenttoday while still adhering to the reasoning and the holding
of [Sinclair v. United States, 279 U. S. 263 (1929)]." Ante,at 519-520. Before today, every Court of Appeals that has
considered the issue, except for the Ninth Circuit, has heldthat the question of materiality is one of law. See 28 F. 3d,
at 955 (Kozinski, J., dissenting) (collecting cases). Thus, it iscertainly subject to dispute whether the error in this case
was "clear under current law." Olano, supra, at 734. TheCourt, however, does not review the Court of Appeals' determination that the failure to submit the issue of materialityto the jury constituted "plain error." 28 F. 3d, at 952.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe first circuit

No. 94-623. Argued March 20, 1995--Decided June 19, 1995
After a New York fruit distributor's produce was damaged in transit from

Morocco to Massachusetts aboard respondent vessel, which was owned
by respondent Panamanian company and chartered to a Japanese carrier, petitioner insurer paid the distributor's claim, and they both sued
respondents under the standard form bill of lading tendered to the distributor by its Moroccan supplier. Respondents moved to stay the action and compel arbitration in Tokyo under the bill of lading's foreign
arbitration clause and the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA). The District
Court granted the motion, rejecting the argument of petitioner and the
distributor that the arbitration clause was unenforceable under the FAA
because, inter alia, it violated $ 3(8) of the Carriage of Goods by Sea
Act (COGSA) in that the inconvenience and costs of proceeding in Japan
would "lesse[n] . . . liability" in the sense that COGSA prohibits. However, the court certified for interlocutory appeal its ruling to compel
arbitration, stating that the controlling question of law was "whether
[$ 3(8)] nullifies an arbitration clause contained in a bill of lading governed by COGSA." In affirming the order to arbitrate, the First Circuit expressed grave doubt whether a foreign arbitration clause lessened liability under $ 3(8), but assumed the clause was invalid under
COGSA and resolved the conflict between the statutes in the FAA's
favor.

Held: COGSA does not nullify foreign arbitration clauses contained in

maritime bills of lading. Pp. 533-541.

(a) Examined with care, $ 3(8) does not support petitioner's argument
that a foreign arbitration clause lessens COGSA liability by increasing
the transaction costs of obtaining relief. Because it requires that the
"liability" that may not be "lessen[ed]" "aris[e] from . . . failure in the
duties or obligations provided in this section," $ 3(8) is concerned with
the liability imposed elsewhere in $ 3, which defines that liability by
explicit obligations and procedures designed to correct certain abuses
by carriers, but does not address the separate question of the particular
forum or other procedural enforcement mechanisms. Petitioner's contrary reading of $ 3(8) is undermined by Carnival Cruise Lines, Inc. v.
Shute, 499 U. S. 585, 595-596, whereas the Court's reading finds support

Syllabus
in the goals of the so-called Hague Rules, the international convention
on which COGSA is modeled, and in the pertinent decisions and statutes
of other nations. It would be out of keeping with such goals and with
contemporary principles of international comity and commercial practice
to interpret COGSA to disparage the authority or competence of international forums for dispute resolution. The irony of petitioner's argument in favor of such an interpretation is heightened by the fact that
the forum here is arbitration, for the FAA is also based in part on an
international convention. For the United States to be able to gain the
benefits of international accords, its courts must not construe COGSA
to nullify foreign arbitration clauses because of inconvenience to the
plaintiff or insular distrust of the ability of foreign arbitrators to apply
the law. Pp. 533-539.

(b) Also rejected is petitioner's argument that the arbitration clause
should not be enforced because there is no guarantee foreign arbitrators
will apply COGSA. According to petitioner, the arbitrators will follow
the Japanese Hague Rules, which significantly lessen respondents' liability by providing carriers with a defense based on the acts or omissions
of the stevedores hired by the shipper, rather than COGSA, which
makes nondelegable the carrier's obligation to properly and carefully
stow the goods carried. Whatever the merits of this comparative reading, petitioner's claim is premature because, at this interlocutory stage,
it is not established what law the arbitrators will apply or that petitioner will receive diminished protection as a result. The District
Court has retained jurisdiction over the case and will have the opportunity at the award-enforcement stage to ensure that the legitimate interest in the enforcement of the laws has been addressed. Pp. 539-541.

(c) In light of the foregoing, the relevant provisions of COGSA and
the FAA are in accord, and both Acts may be given full effect. It
is therefore unnecessary to resolve the further question whether the
FAA would override COGSA were COGSA interpreted otherwise.

Opinion of the Court

Thomas H. Walsh, Jr., argued the cause for respondents.With him on the brief was John J. Finn.*

Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case requires us to interpret the Carriage of Goodsby Sea Act (COGSA), 46 U. S. C. App. $ 1300

et seq., as itrelates to a contract containing a clause requiring arbitration in a foreign country. The question is whether a foreignarbitration clause in a bill of lading is invalid under COGSA
because it lessens liability in the sense that COGSA prohib-its. Our holding that COGSA does not forbid selection of
the foreign forum makes it unnecessary to resolve the fur-ther question whether the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9
U. S. C. $ 1 et seq. (1988 ed. and Supp. V), would overrideCOGSA were it interpreted otherwise. In our view, the
relevant provisions of COGSA and the FAA are in accord,not in conflict.

The contract at issue in this case is a standard form bill oflading to evidence the purchase of a shipload of Moroccan

oranges and lemons. The purchaser was Bacchus Associates(Bacchus), a New York partnership that distributes fruit at
wholesale throughout the Northeastern United States. Bac-chus dealt with Galaxie Negoce, S. A. (Galaxie), a Moroccan
fruit supplier. Bacchus contracted with Galaxie to purchasethe shipload of fruit and chartered a ship to transport it from
Morocco to Massachusetts. The ship was the M/V SkyReefer, a refrigerated cargo ship owned by M. H. Maritima,
S. A., a Panamanian company, and time-chartered to NichiroGyogyo Kaisha, Ltd., a Japanese company. Stevedores

Opinion of the Court
hired by Galaxie loaded and stowed the cargo. As is cus-tomary in these types of transactions, when it received the

cargo from Galaxie, Nichiro as carrier issued a form bill oflading to Galaxie as shipper and consignee. Once the ship
set sail from Morocco, Galaxie tendered the bill of lading to
Bacchus according to the terms of a letter of credit postedin Galaxie's favor.

Among the rights and responsibilities set out in the bill oflading were arbitration and choice-of-law clauses. Clause 3,
entitled "Governing Law and Arbitration," provided:

"(1) The contract evidenced by or contained in this
Bill of Lading shall be governed by the Japanese law."(2) Any dispute arising from this Bill of Lading shall

be referred to arbitration in Tokyo by the Tokyo Mari-time Arbitration Commission (TOMAC) of The Japan
Shipping Exchange, Inc., in accordance with the rules ofTOMAC and any amendment thereto, and the award
given by the arbitrators shall be final and binding on
both parties." App. 49.

When the vessel's hatches were opened for discharge in
Massachusetts, Bacchus discovered that thousands of boxes
of oranges had shifted in the cargo holds, resulting in over
$1 million damage. Bacchus received $733,442.90 compensation from petitioner Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros (Vimar
Seguros), Bacchus' marine cargo insurer that became subrogated pro tanto to Bacchus' rights. Petitioner and Bacchus
then brought suit against Maritima in personam and M/V
Sky Reefer in rem in the District Court for the District of
Massachusetts under the bill of lading. These defendants,
respondents here, moved to stay the action and compel arbitration in Tokyo under clause 3 of the bill of lading and $ 3
of the FAA, which requires courts to stay proceedings and
enforce arbitration agreements covered by the Act. Petitioner and Bacchus opposed the motion, arguing the arbitra515us2$82l 08-25-98 19:29:01 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court

tion clause was unenforceable under the FAA both becauseit was a contract of adhesion and because it violated COGSA

$ 3(8). The premise of the latter argument was that the in-convenience and costs of proceeding in Japan would "lesse[n]
. . . liability" as those terms are used in COGSA.

The District Court rejected the adhesion argument, ob-serving that Congress defined the arbitration agreements

enforceable under the FAA to include maritime bills of lad-ing, 9 U. S. C. $ 1, and that petitioner was a sophisticated
party familiar with the negotiation of maritime shippingtransactions. It also rejected the argument that requiring
the parties to submit to arbitration would lessen respondents' liability under COGSA $ 3(8). The court granted the
motion to stay judicial proceedings and to compel arbitration;
it retained jurisdiction pending arbitration; and at petitioner's request, it certified for interlocutory appeal under 28
U. S. C. $ 1292(b) its ruling to compel arbitration, stating that
the controlling question of law was "whether [COGSA $ 3(8)]
nullifies an arbitration clause contained in a bill of lading
governed by COGSA." Pet. for Cert. 30a.

The First Circuit affirmed the order to arbitrate. 29 F. 3d
727 (1994). Although it expressed grave doubt whether a
foreign arbitration clause lessened liability under COGSA

$ 3(8), id., at 730, the Court of Appeals assumed the clause
was invalid under COGSA and resolved the conflict between
the statutes in favor of the FAA, which it considered to be
the later enacted and more specific statute, id., at 731-733.
We granted certiorari, 513 U. S. 1013 (1995), to resolve a Circuit split on the enforceability of foreign arbitration clauses
in maritime bills of lading. Compare the case below (enforcing foreign arbitration clause assuming arguendo it violated
COGSA), with State Establishment for Agricultural Product Trading v. M/V Wesermunde, 838 F. 2d 1576 (CA11) (declining to enforce foreign arbitration clause because that
would violate COGSA), cert. denied, 488 U. S. 916 (1988).
We now affirm.

Opinion of the Court

II
The parties devote much of their argument to the questionwhether COGSA or the FAA has priority. "[W]hen two

statutes are capable of co-existence," however, "it is the dutyof the courts, absent a clearly expressed congressional intention to the contrary, to regard each as effective." Mortonv.

Mancari, 417 U. S. 535, 551 (1974); Pittsburgh & Lake
Erie R. Co. v. Railway Labor Executives' Assn., 491 U. S.490, 510 (1989). There is no conflict unless COGSA by its

own terms nullifies a foreign arbitration clause, and wechoose to address that issue rather than assume nullification
arguendo, as the Court of Appeals did. We consider the twoarguments made by petitioner. The first is that a foreign
arbitration clause lessens COGSA liability by increasing thetransaction costs of obtaining relief. The second is that
there is a risk foreign arbitrators will not apply COGSA.

A
The leading case for invalidation of a foreign forum selec-tion clause is the opinion of the Court of Appeals for the

Second Circuit in Indussa Corp. v. S. S. Ranborg, 377 F. 2d200 (1967) (en banc). The court there found that COGSA
invalidated a clause designating a foreign judicial forum be-cause it "puts `a high hurdle' in the way of enforcing liability,
and thus is an effective means for carriers to secure settle-ments lower than if cargo [owners] could sue in a convenient
forum." Id., at 203 (citation omitted). The court observed"there could be no assurance that [the foreign court] would
apply [COGSA] in the same way as would an American tribu-nal subject to the uniform control of the Supreme Court."
Id., at 203-204. Following Indussa, the Courts of Appealswithout exception have invalidated foreign forum selection
clauses under $ 3(8). See Union Ins. Soc. of Canton, Ltd. v.S. S. Elikon, 642 F. 2d 721, 723-725 (CA4 1981); Conklin &

Opinion of the Court

145-146, n. 23 (2d ed. 1975) (approving Indussa rule). Asforeign arbitration clauses are but a subset of foreign forum

selection clauses in general, Scherk v. Alberto-Culver Co.,417 U. S. 506, 519 (1974), the

Indussa holding has been
extended to foreign arbitration clauses as well. See State
Establishment for Agricultural Product Trading, supra, at1580-1581; cf.

Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros, supra, at 730,
(assuming, arguendo, Indussa applies). The logic of thatextension would be quite defensible, but we cannot endorse

the reasoning or the conclusion of the Indussa rule itself.The determinative provision in COGSA, examined with
care, does not support the arguments advanced first in Indussa and now by petitioner. Section 3(8) of COGSA provides as follows:

"Any clause, covenant, or agreement in a contract of
carriage relieving the carrier or the ship from liabilityfor loss or damage to or in connection with the goods,

arising from negligence, fault, or failure in the duties
and obligations provided in this section, or lesseningsuch liability otherwise than as provided in this chapter,

shall be null and void and of no effect." 46 U. S. C.App. $ 1303(8).

The liability that may not be lessened is "liability for loss or
damage . . . arising from negligence, fault, or failure in the
duties and obligations provided in this section." The stat-ute thus addresses the lessening of the specific liability imposed by the Act, without addressing the separate questionof the means and costs of enforcing that liability. The difference is that between explicit statutory guarantees and the
procedure for enforcing them, between applicable liability
principles and the forum in which they are to be vindicated.

The liability imposed on carriers under COGSA $ 3 is
defined by explicit standards of conduct, and it is designed
to correct specific abuses by carriers. In the 19th century
it was a prevalent practice for common carriers to insert

clauses in bills of lading exempting themselves from liabilityfor damage or loss, limiting the period in which plaintiffs had

to present their notice of claim or bring suit, and cappingany damages awards per package. See 2A M. Sturley, Benedict on Admiralty $ 11, pp. 2-2 to 2-3 (1995); 2 T. Schoenbaum, Admiralty and Maritime Law $ 10-13 (2d ed. 1994);Yancey, The Carriage of Goods: Hague, COGSA, Visby, and

Hamburg, 57 Tulane L. Rev. 1238, 1239-1240 (1983). Thus,$ 3, entitled "Responsibilities and liabilities of carrier and
ship," requires that the carrier "exercise due diligence to . . .[m]ake the ship seaworthy" and "[p]roperly man, equip, and
supply the ship" before and at the beginning of the voyage,

$ 3(1), "properly and carefully load, handle, stow, carry, keep,

bill of lading with specified contents, $ 3(3). 46 U. S. C. App.

$$ 1303(1), (2), and (3). Section 3(6) allows the cargo owner
to provide notice of loss or damage within three days and
to bring suit within one year. These are the substantive
obligations and particular procedures that $ 3(8) prohibits
a carrier from altering to its advantage in a bill of lading.
Nothing in this section, however, suggests that the statute prevents the parties from agreeing to enforce these obligations in a particular forum. By its terms, it establishes
certain duties and obligations, separate and apart from the
mechanisms for their enforcement.

Petitioner's contrary reading of $ 3(8) is undermined by
the Court's construction of a similar statutory provision in
Carnival Cruise Lines, Inc. v. Shute, 499 U. S. 585 (1991).
There a number of Washington residents argued that a Florida forum selection clause contained in a cruise ticket should
not be enforced because the expense and inconvenience of
litigation in Florida would "caus[e] plaintiffs unreasonable
hardship in asserting their rights," id., at 596, and therefore
" `lessen, weaken, or avoid the right of any claimant to a trial

Opinion of the Court

in violation of the Limitation of Vessel Owner's Liability Act,
id., at 595-596 (quoting 46 U. S. C. App. $ 183c). We observed that the clause "does not purport to limit petitioner'sliability for negligence," 499 U. S., at 596-597, and enforced

the agreement over the dissent's argument, based in part on
the Indussa line of cases, that the cost and inconvenience oftraveling thousands of miles "lessens or weakens [plaintiffs']

ability to recover," 499 U. S., at 603 (Stevens, J., dissenting).If the question whether a provision lessens liability were
answered by reference to the costs and inconvenience to thecargo owner, there would be no principled basis for distinguishing national from foreign arbitration clauses. Even if
it were reasonable to read $ 3(8) to make a distinction based
on travel time, airfare, and hotels bills, these factors are not
susceptible of a simple and enforceable distinction between
domestic and foreign forums. Requiring a Seattle cargo
owner to arbitrate in New York likely imposes more costs
and burdens than a foreign arbitration clause requiring it to
arbitrate in Vancouver. It would be unwieldy and unsupported by the terms or policy of the statute to require courts
to proceed case by case to tally the costs and burdens to
particular plaintiffs in light of their means, the size of their
claims, and the relative burden on the carrier.

Our reading of "lessening such liability" to exclude increases in the transaction costs of litigation also finds support in the goals of the Brussels Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to Bills of Lading, 51 Stat.
233 (1924) (Hague Rules), on which COGSA is modeled.

The Influence of Domestic Law in Conflicts of Interpretation,27 Va. J. Int'l L. 729, 776-796 (1987). The English courts

Maharani Woollen Mills Co. v. Anchor Line,
[1927] 29 Lloyd's List L. Rep. 169 (C. A.) (Scrutton, L. J.)
("[T]he liability of the carrier appears to me to remain ex-actly the same under the clause. The only difference is a

question of procedure--where shall the law be enforced?--and I do not read any clause as to procedure as lessening
liability"). And other countries that do not recognize for-eign forum selection clauses rely on specific provisions to
that effect in their domestic versions of the Hague Rules,
see, e. g., Sea-Carriage of Goods Act 1924, $ 9(2) (Australia);
Carriage of Goods by Sea Act, No. 1 of 1986, $ 3 (South Africa). In light of the fact that COGSA is the culmination of
a multilateral effort "to establish uniform ocean bills of lading to govern the rights and liabilities of carriers and shippers inter se in international trade," Robert C. Herd & Co. v.
Krawill Machinery Corp., 359 U. S. 297, 301 (1959), we decline to interpret our version of the Hague Rules in a manner
contrary to every other nation to have addressed this issue.
See Sturley, supra, at 736 (conflicts in the interpretation of
the Hague Rules not only destroy esthetic symmetry in the
international legal order but impose real costs on the commercial system the Rules govern).

It would also be out of keeping with the objects of the
Convention for the courts of this country to interpret
COGSA to disparage the authority or competence of international forums for dispute resolution. Petitioner's skepticism
over the ability of foreign arbitrators to apply COGSA or the
Hague Rules, and its reliance on this aspect of Indussa Corp.

in world markets." Id., at 12. "The expansion of Americanbusiness and industry will hardly be encouraged," we explained, "if, notwithstanding solemn contracts, we insist on
a parochial concept that all disputes must be resolved underour laws and in our courts."

Id., at 9. See Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U. S. 614,638 (1985) (if international arbitral institutions "are to take

a central place in the international legal order, nationalcourts will need to `shake off the old judicial hostility to arbitration,' and also their customary and understandable unwillingness to cede jurisdiction of a claim arising under domestic
law to a foreign or transnational tribunal") (citation omitted);

Market, 18 N. Y. U. J. Int'l Law & Pol. 361, 439 (1986).

That the forum here is arbitration only heightens the irony
of petitioner's argument, for the FAA is also based in part
on an international convention, 9 U. S. C. $ 201 et seq. (codifying the United Nations Convention on the Recognition and
Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, June 10, 1958,

the standards by which agreements to arbitrate are observed
and arbitral awards are enforced in the signatory countries,"

of lading, see 9 U. S. C. $$ 1, 2, 201, 202, where there is noindependent basis in law or equity for revocation, cf. Carnival Cruise Lines, 499 U. S., at 595 ("[F]orum-selectionclauses contained in form passage contracts are subject to
judicial scrutiny for fundamental fairness"). If the UnitedStates is to be able to gain the benefits of international accords and have a role as a trusted partner in multilateralendeavors, its courts should be most cautious before interpreting its domestic legislation in such manner as to violateinternational agreements. That concern counsels against
construing COGSA to nullify foreign arbitration clausesbecause of inconvenience to the plaintiff or insular distrust
of the ability of foreign arbitrators to apply the law.

B
Petitioner's second argument against enforcement of theJapanese arbitration clause is that there is no guarantee foreign arbitrators will apply COGSA. This objection raises aconcern of substance. The central guarantee of $ 3(8) is that
the terms of a bill of lading may not relieve the carrier ofthe obligations or diminish the legal duties specified by the
Act. The relevant question, therefore, is whether the sub-stantive law to be applied will reduce the carrier's obligations to the cargo owner below what COGSA guarantees.See Mitsubishi Motors, supra, at 637, n. 19.

Petitioner argues that the arbitrators will follow the Japa-nese Hague Rules, which, petitioner contends, lessen respondents' liability in at least one significant respect. TheJapanese version of the Hague Rules, it is said, provides the
carrier with a defense based on the acts or omissions of thestevedores hired by the shipper, Galaxie, see App. 112, Article 3(1) (carrier liable "when he or the persons employed byhim" fail to take due care), while COGSA, according to petitioner, makes nondelegable the carrier's obligation to "prop-erly and carefully . . . stow . . . the goods carried," COGSA

Whatever the merits of petitioner's comparative readingof COGSA and its Japanese counterpart, its claim is premature. At this interlocutory stage it is not established what
law the arbitrators will apply to petitioner's claims or thatpetitioner will receive diminished protection as a result.

The arbitrators may conclude that COGSA applies of its ownforce or that Japanese law does not apply so that, under another clause of the bill of lading, COGSA controls. Respond-ents seek only to enforce the arbitration agreement. The
District Court has retained jurisdiction over the case and"will have the opportunity at the award-enforcement stage
to ensure that the legitimate interest in the enforcement of
the . . . laws has been addressed." Mitsubishi Motors,

United States need not recognize a judgment of the court of

public policy of the United States"). Were there no subsequent opportunity for review and were we persuaded that
"the choice-of-forum and choice-of-law clauses operated in
tandem as a prospective waiver of a party's right to pursue
statutory remedies . . . , we would have little hesitation in
condemning the agreement as against public policy." Mitsubishi Motors, supra, at 637, n. 19. Cf. Knott v. Botany

where British law would give effect to provision in bill of
lading that purported to exempt carrier from liability for
damage to goods caused by carrier's negligence in loading
and stowage of cargo); The Hollandia, [1983] A. C. 565, 574-
575 (H. L. 1982) (noting choice-of-forum clause "does not ex

clause unenforceable where "the foreign court chosen as the
exclusive forum would apply a domestic substantive law
which would result in limiting the carrier's liability to a sum
lower than that to which he would be entitled if [English
COGSA] applied"). Under the circumstances of this case,
however, the First Circuit was correct to reserve judgment
on the choice-of-law question, 29 F. 3d, at 729, n. 3, as it
must be decided in the first instance by the arbitrator, cf.
Mitsubishi Motors, 473 U. S., at 637, n. 19. As the District
Court has retained jurisdiction, mere speculation that the
foreign arbitrators might apply Japanese law which, depending on the proper construction of COGSA, might reduce respondents' legal obligations, does not in and of itself lessen
liability under COGSA $ 3(8).

Because we hold that foreign arbitration clauses in bills of
lading are not invalid under COGSA in all circumstances,
both the FAA and COGSA may be given full effect. The
judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed, and the case
is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this

holding that the increased cost of litigating in a distantforum, without more, can lessen liability within the meaning

of COGSA $ 3(8). Ante, at 534-536. Second, I agree that,because the District Court has retained jurisdiction over this
case while the arbitration proceeds, any claim of lessening ofliability that might arise out of the arbitrators' interpretation of the bill of lading's choice-of-law clause, or out of theirapplication of COGSA, is premature.

Ante, at 539-541.Those two points suffice to affirm the decision below.

Because the Court's opinion appears to do more, however,I concur only in the judgment. Foreign arbitration clauses
of the kind presented here do not divest domestic courts ofjurisdiction, unlike true foreign forum selection clauses such
as that considered in Indussa Corp. v. S. S. Ranborg, 377F. 2d 200 (CA2 1967) (en banc). That difference is an important one--it is, after all, what leads the Court to dis-miss much of petitioner's argument as premature--and we
need not decide today whether Indussa, insofar as it reliedon considerations other than the increased cost of litigating
in a distant forum, retains any vitality in the context of trueforeign forum selection clauses. Accordingly, I would not,
without qualification, reject "the reasoning [and] the con-clusion of the Indussa rule itself," ante, at 534, nor would I
wholeheartedly approve an English decision that "long agorejected the reasoning later adopted by the Indussa court,"
ante, at 537. As the Court notes, "[f]ollowing Indussa, theCourts of Appeals without exception have invalidated foreign forum selection clauses under $ 3(8)." Ante, at 533. Iwould prefer to disturb that unbroken line of authority only
to the extent necessary to decide this case.

terms of bills of lading issued by ocean carriers transportingcargo to or from ports of the United States. Section 3(8) of

COGSA provides:

"Any clause, covenant, or agreement in a contract of car-riage relieving the carrier or the ship from liability for

loss or damage to or in connection with the goods, aris-ing from negligence, fault, or failure in the duties and
obligations provided in this section, or lessening suchliability otherwise than as provided in this chapter, shall
be null and void and of no effect." 46 U. S. C. App.$ 1303(8).

Petitioners in this case challenge the enforceability of aforeign arbitration clause, coupled with a choice-of-foreignlaw clause, in a bill of lading covering a shipment of orangesfrom Morocco to Boston, Massachusetts. The bill, issued by
the Japanese carrier, provides (1) that the transaction " `shallbe governed by the Japanese law,' " and (2) that any dispute
arising from the bill shall be arbitrated in Tokyo. See ante,at 531. Under the construction of COGSA that has been
uniformly followed by the Courts of Appeals and endorsedby scholarly commentary for decades, both of those clauses
are unenforceable against the shipper because they "relieve"or "lessen" the liability of the carrier. Nevertheless, relying
almost entirely on a recent case involving a domestic forumselection clause that was not even covered by COGSA,

Carnival Cruise Lines, Inc. v. Shute, 499 U. S. 585 (1991), theCourt today unwisely discards settled law and adopts a novel

construction of $ 3(8). I

In the 19th century it was common practice for shipownersto issue bills of lading that included stipulations exempting
themselves from liability for losses occasioned by the neg-ligence of their employees. Because a bill of lading was
(and is) a contract of adhesion, which a shipper must acceptor else find another means to transport his goods, shippers

were in no position to bargain around these no-liabilityclauses. Although the English courts enforced the stipulations, see Compania de Navigacion la Flecha v. Brauer, 168U. S. 104, 117-118 (1897), citing Peck v. North Staffordshire
Railway, 10 H. L. Cas. 473, 493, 494 (1863), this Court con-cluded, even prior to the 1893 enactment of the Harter Act,
that they were "contrary to public policy, and consequentlyvoid,"

Liverpool & Great Western Steam Co. v. Phenix Ins.Co., 129 U. S. 397, 442 (1889).

3 As we noted in Brauer, several District Courts had held that such a stipulation was in-valid even when the bill of lading also contained a choice-oflaw clause providing that "the contract should be governedby the law of England." 168 U. S., at 118. The question
whether such a choice-of-law clause was itself valid remainedopen in this Court until the Harter Act was passed in 1893.

Section 1 of the Harter Act makes it unlawful for the mas-ter or owner of any vessel transporting cargo between ports
of the United States and foreign ports to insert in any bill oflading any clause whereby the carrier "shall be relieved from
liability for loss or damage arising from negligence." 4 In

3 In support of its holding in Liverpool Steam, the Court observed:
"The carrier and his customer do not stand upon a footing of equality.
The individual customer has no real freedom of choice. He cannot afford
to higgle or stand out, and seek redress in the courts. He prefers rather
to accept any bill of lading, or to sign any paper, that the carrier presents;
and in most cases he has no alternative but to do this, or to abandon his
business." 129 U. S., at 441.

4 The first section of the Harter Act provides:

"Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled, That it shall not be
lawful for the manager, agent, master, or owner of any vessel transporting
merchandise or property from or between ports of the United States and
foreign ports to insert in any bill of lading or shipping document any
clause, covenant, or agreement whereby it, he, or they shall be relieved
from liability for loss or damage arising from negligence, fault, or failure
in proper loading, stowage, custody, care, or proper delivery of any and all
lawful merchandise or property committed to its or their charge. Any

Knott v. Botany Mills, 179 U. S. 69 (1900), we were pre-sented with the question whether that prohibition applied to

a bill of lading containing a choice-of-law clause designatingBritish law as controlling. The Court held:

"Th[e] express provision of the act of Congress over-rides and nullifies the stipulations of the bill of lading
that the carrier shall be exempt from liability for suchnegligence, and that the contract shall be governed by
the law of the ship's flag." Id., at 77.
The Court's holding that the choice-of-law clause was in-valid rested entirely on the Harter Act's prohibition against

relieving the carrier from liability. Id., at 72. Since Knott,courts have consistently understood the Harter Act to create
a flat ban on foreign choice-of-law clauses in bills of lading.See, e. g., Conklin & Garrett, Ltd. v. M/V Finnrose, 826 F. 2d
1441, 1442-1444 (CA5 1987); Union Ins. Soc. of Canton, Ltd.v.

S. S. Elikon, 642 F. 2d 721, 723-725 (CA4 1981); IndussaCorp. v. S. S. Ranborg, 377 F. 2d 200 (CA2 1967). Courts

have also consistently found such clauses invalid underCOGSA, which embodies an even broader prohibition against
clauses "relieving" or "lessening" a carrier's liability. In-deed, when a panel of the Second Circuit in 1955 interpreted
COGSA to permit a foreign choice-of-law clause, Muller v.
Swedish American Line Ltd., 224 F. 2d 806, scholars notedthat "the case seems impossible to reconcile with the holding

in Knott." 5 Eventually agreeing, the en banc court unani-mously overruled Muller in 1967. Indussa Corp., 377 F. 2d,

U. S. C. App. $ 190.

This section was rendered obsolete by $ 3(8) of COGSA, a broader prohibition that invalidates clauses either "relieving" or "lessening" a carrier's
liability. 46 U. S. C. App. $ 1303(8), quoted supra, at 543.

of-law holding in Muller, but also its enforcement of a foreignchoice-of-forum clause. They wrote:

"The stipulation for suit abroad seems also to offendCogsa, most obviously because it destroys the shipper's
certainty that Cogsa will be applied. Further, it is en-tirely unrealistic to look on an obligation to sue overseas
as not `lessening' the liability of the carrier. It putsa high hurdle in the way of enforcing that liability."
G. Gilmore & C. Black, Law of Admiralty 125, n. 23.
Judge Friendly's opinion for the en banc court in Indussaendorsed this reasoning. In

Indussa, the bill of lading con-tained a provision requiring disputes to be resolved in Norway under Norwegian law.6 Judge Friendly first remarkedon the harsh consequence of "requiring an American consignee claiming damages in the modest sum of $2,600 to jour-ney some 4200 miles to a court having a different legal system and employing another language." 377 F. 2d, at 201.The decision, however, rested not only on the impact of the
provision on a relatively small claim, but also on a fair read-ing of the broad language in COGSA. Judge Friendly
explained:

"[Section] 3(8) of COGSA says that `any clause, cove-nant, or agreement in a contract of carriage * * * lessening [the carrier's liability for negligence, fault, or derelic-tion of statutory duties] otherwise than as provided in
this Act, shall be null and void and of no effect.' Froma practical standpoint, to require an American plaintiff
to assert his claim only in a distant court lessens theliability of the carrier quite substantially, particularly
when the claim is small. Such a clause puts `a high hur6 The bill of lading contained the following provision:

dle' in the way of enforcing liability, Gilmore & Black,supra, 125 n. 23, and thus is an effective means for carriers to secure settlements lower than if cargo could suein a convenient forum. A clause making a claim triable

other of these regimes, requiring trial abroad mightlessen the carrier's liability since there could be no assurance that it would apply them in the same wayas would an American tribunal subject to the uniform
control of the Supreme Court, and $ 3(8) can well beread as covering a potential and not simply a demonstrable lessening of liability." Id., at 203-204 (citationsomitted).

As the Court notes, ante, at 533, the Courts of Appealswithout exception have followed Indussa. In the 1975 edition of their treatise, Gilmore and Black also endorsed itsholding, adding this comment:

"Cogsa allows a freedom of contracting out of its terms,but only in the direction of increasing the shipowner's
liabilities, and never in the direction of diminishingthem. This apparent onesidedness is a commonsense
recognition of the inequality in bargaining power whichboth Harter and Cogsa were designed to redress, and of
the fact that one of the great objectives of both Acts isto prevent the impairment of the value and negotiability
of the ocean bill of lading. Obviously, the latter resultcan never ensue from the increase of the carrier's duties." G. Gilmore & C. Black, Law of Admiralty 145-147 (2d ed.) (emphasis in original; footnote omitted).

Thus, our interpretation of maritime law prior to the en-actment of the Harter Act, our reading of that statute in
Knott, and the federal courts' consistent interpretation of

COGSA, buttressed by scholarly recognition of the commer-cial interest in uniformity, demonstrate that the clauses in

the Japanese carrier's bill of lading purporting to requirearbitration in Tokyo pursuant to Japanese law both would
have been held invalid under COGSA prior to today.7The foreign-arbitration clause imposes potentially prohibitive costs on the shipper, who must travel--and bringhis lawyers, witnesses, and exhibits--to a distant country
in order to seek redress. The shipper will therefore beinclined either to settle the claim at a discount or to forgo
bringing the claim at all. The foreign-law clause leaves theshipper who does pursue his claim open to the application of
unfamiliar and potentially disadvantageous legal standards,until he can obtain review (perhaps years later) in a domestic
forum under the high standard applicable to vacation of arbi-tration awards.

8 See Wilko v. Swan, 346 U. S. 427, 436-437

7 Of course, the objectionable feature in the instant bill of lading is a
foreign arbitration clause, not a foreign forum selection clause. But this
distinction is of little importance; in relevant respects, there is no difference between the two. Both impose substantial costs on shippers, and
both should be held to lessen liability under COGSA. The majority's reasoning to the contrary thus presumably covers forum selection as well as
arbitration. See ante, at 533-534; ante, at 542 (O'Connor, J., concurring
in judgment). The only ground on which one might distinguish the two
types of clauses is that another federal statute, the Federal Arbitration
Act, makes arbitration clauses enforceable, whereas no analogous federal
statute exists for forum selection clauses. For the reasons expressed
infra, at 554-556, this distinction is unpersuasive.

8 I am assuming that the majority would not actually uphold the application of disadvantageous legal standards--these, even under the narrowest
reading of COGSA, surely lessen liability. See ante, at 539-541. Nonetheless, the majority is apparently willing to allow arbitration to proceed
under foreign law, and to determine afterwards whether application of
that law has actually lessened the carrier's formal liability. As I have
discussed above, this regime creates serious problems of delay and uncertainty. Because the majority's holding in this case is limited to the enforceability of the foreign arbitration clause--it does not actually pass
upon the validity of the foreign-law clause--I will not discuss the foreignlaw clause further except to say that it is an unenforceable lessening of

(1953). Accordingly, courts have always held that suchclauses "lessen" or "relieve" the carrier's liability, see, e. g.,

State Establishment for Agricultural Product Trading v.M/V Wesermunde, 838 F. 2d 1576, 1580-1582 (CA11), cert.
denied, 488 U. S. 916 (1988), and even the Court of Appealsin this case assumed as much, 29 F. 3d 727, 730, 732, n. 5
(CA1 1994).9 Yet this Court today holds that carriers mayinsert foreign-arbitration clauses into bills of lading, and it
leaves in doubt the validity of choice-of-law clauses.Although the policy undergirding the doctrine of

stare de-cisis has its greatest value in preserving rules governing

commercial transactions, particularly when their meaning iswell understood and has been accepted for long periods of
time,10 the Court nevertheless has concluded that a changemust be made. Its law-changing decision is supported by
three arguments: (1) the statutory reference to "lesseningsuch liability" has been misconstrued; (2) the prior understanding of the meaning of the statute has been "under-mined" by the

Carnival Cruise case; and (3) the new ruleis supported by our obligation to honor the 1924 "Hague

Rules." None of these arguments is persuasive.

II
The Court assumes that the words "lessening such liabil-ity" must be narrowly construed to refer only to the substantive rules that define the carrier's legal obligations. Ante,at 534-535. Under this view, contractual provisions that
lessen the amount of the consignee's net recovery, or that
liability to the extent it gives an advantage to the carrier at the expense
of the shipper.

9 The Court of Appeals enforced the arbitration clause, despite its concession that the clause might violate COGSA, because of its perception
that COGSA must give way to the conflicting dictate of the Federal Arbitration Act. 29 F. 3d, at 731-733. I consider, and reject, this argument
infra, at 554-556.

lessen the likelihood that it will make any recovery at all,are beyond the scope of the statute.

In my opinion, this view is flatly inconsistent with the pur-pose of COGSA $ 3(8). That section responds to the inequality of bargaining power inherent in bills of lading and to car-riers' historic tendency to exploit that inequality whenever
possible to immunize themselves from liability for their ownfault. A bill of lading is a form document prepared by the
carrier, who presents it to the shipper on a take-it-or-leave-itbasis. See Black, The Bremen, COGSA and the Problem of
Conflicting Interpretation, 6 Vand. J. Transnat'l L. 365, 368(1973);

Liverpool Steam, 129 U. S., at 441. Characteristi-cally, there is no arm's-length negotiation over the bill's

terms; the shipper must agree to the carrier's standard-formlanguage, or else refrain from using the carrier's services.
Accordingly, if courts were to enforce bills of lading as writ-ten, a carrier could slip in a clause relieving itself of all liability for fault, or limiting that liability to a fraction of the ship-per's damages, and the shipper would have no recourse.

11

COGSA represents Congress' most recent attempt to re-spond to this problem. By its terms, it invalidates any

clause in a bill of lading "relieving" or "lessening" the "liabil-ity" of the carrier for negligence, fault, or dereliction of duty.

11 See United States v. Farr Sugar Corp., 191 F. 2d 370, 374 (CA2 1951),
aff'd, 343 U. S. 236 (1952):

"One other fact requires special note. The shipowners stress the consensual nature of the ["Both-to-Blame"] clause, arguing that a bill of lading
is but a contract. But that is so at most in name only; the clause, as we
are told, is now in practically all bills of lading issued by steamship companies doing business to and from the United States. Obviously the individual shipper has no opportunity to repudiate the document agreed upon by
the trade, even if he has actually examined it and all its twenty-eight
lengthy paragraphs, of which this clause is No. 9. This lack of equality of
bargaining power has long been recognized in our law; and stipulations for
unreasonable exemption of the carrier have not been allowed to stand.
Hence so definite a relinquishment of what the law gives the cargo as is
found here can hardly be found reasonable without direct authorization of
law." (Citations omitted.)

When one reads the statutory language in light of the poli-cies behind COGSA's enactment, it is perfectly clear that a

foreign forum selection or arbitration clause "relieves" or"lessens" the carrier's liability. The transaction costs associated with an arbitration in Japan will obviously exceed thepotential recovery in a great many cargo disputes. As a
practical matter, therefore, in such a case no matter howclear the carrier's formal legal liability may be, it would
make no sense for the consignee or its subrogee to enforcethat liability. It seems to me that a contractual provision
that entirely protects the shipper from being held liable foranything should be construed either to have "lessened" its
liability or to have "relieved" it of liability.Even if the value of the shipper's claim is large enough to
justify litigation in Asia,12 contractual provisions that imposeunnecessary and unreasonable costs on the consignee will
inevitably lessen its net recovery. If, as under the Court'sreasoning, such provisions do not affect the carrier's legal
liability, it would appear to be permissible to require the con-signee to pay the costs of the arbitration, or perhaps the
travel expenses and fees of the expert witnesses, interpret-ers, and lawyers employed by both parties. Judge Friendly
and the many other wise judges who shared his opinion weresurely correct in concluding that Congress could not have
intended such a perverse reading of the statutory text.More is at stake here than the allocation of rights and duties between shippers and carriers. A bill of lading, besidesbeing a contract of carriage, is a negotiable instrument that
controls possession of the goods being shipped. Accord-ingly, the bill of lading can be sold, traded, or used to obtain
credit as though the bill were the cargo itself. Disuniform12 The majority's reasoning is not, of course, limited to foreign forums as
accessible as Tokyo. A carrier who truly wished to relieve itself of liability might select an outpost in Antarctica as the setting for arbitration of
all claims. Under the Court's reasoning, such a clause presumably would
be enforceable.

ity in the interpretation of bills of lading will impair theirnegotiability. See Union Ins. Soc. of Canton, Ltd. v. S. S.

Elikon, 642 F. 2d, at 723; G. Gilmore & C. Black, Law ofAdmiralty 146-147 (2d ed. 1975). Thus, if the security interests in some bills of lading are enforceable only through thecourts of Japan, while others may be enforceable only in
Liechtenstein, the negotiability of bills of lading will sufferfrom the uncertainty. COGSA recognizes that this negotiability depends in part upon the financial community's capac-ity to rely on the enforceability, in an accessible forum, of
the bills' terms. Today's decision destroys that capacity.The Court's reliance on its decision in

Carnival Cruise
Lines, Inc. v. Shute, 499 U. S. 585 (1991), is misplaced. Thatcase held that a domestic forum selection clause in a passenger ticket was enforceable. As no carriage of goods was atissue, COGSA did not apply to the parties' dispute. Accordingly, the enforceability of the ticket's terms did not impli-cate the commercial interests in uniformity and negotiability
that are served by the statutory regulation of bills of lading.Moreover, the

Carnival Cruise holding is limited to the en-forceability of domestic forum selection clauses. The Court

in that case pointedly refused to respond to the concern ex-pressed in my dissent that a wooden application of its reasoning might extend its holding to the selection of a forum out-side of the United States. See id., at 604. The wooden
reasoning that the Court adopts today does make that exten-sion, but it is surely not compelled by the holding in

Carni-val Cruise.
13

13 Nor is it compelled by logic. It is true that some domestic forums
are more distant than some foreign forums--a citizen of Maine may have
less trouble arbitrating in Canada than in Arizona. But that is no reason
to eschew any distinction between foreign and domestic forums. If it is
to adhere to Carnival Cruise and yet avoid an outrageous result, the
Court must draw a line somewhere. The most sensible line, it seems to
me, is at the United States border. Transaction costs generally, though
not always, increase when that line is crossed. Passports usually must
be obtained, language barriers often present themselves, and distances

Finally, I am simply baffled by the Court's implicit sug-gestion that our interpretation of the Harter Act (which preceded the Hague Rules), and the federal courts' consistentinterpretation of COGSA since Indussa was decided in 1967,
has somehow been unfaithful to our international commit-ments. See

ante, at 536-539. The concerns about invali-dating freely negotiated forum selection clauses that this

Court expressed in The Bremen v. Zapata Off-Shore Co., 407U. S. 1 (1972), have no bearing on the validity of the provisions in bills of lading that are commonly recognized ascontracts of adhesion. Our international obligations do not
require us to enforce a contractual term that was not freelynegotiated by the parties. Much less do they require us to
ignore the clear meaning of COGSA--itself the product ofinternational negotiations--which forbids enforcement of
clauses lessening the carrier's liability. Indeed, discussing
The Bremen's impact on COGSA, Professor Black observed:

"[I]t is hard to see how it can be looked on as other thana `lessening' of the carrier's liability under COGSA to

remit the bill of lading holder to a distant foreign court.It is quite true that the difficulty imposed would vary
with circumstances; Canada is not Pakistan. But thereis always some palpable `lessening,' for if the choice-offorum clause is ever enforced, the result must be to dis-miss the litigant out of the United States court he has
chosen to sue in. On most moderate-sized claims, re-mission to the foreign forum is a practical immunization
of the carrier from liability." 6 Vand. J. Transnat'l L.,at 368-369.

The majority points to several foreign statutes, passed byother signatories to the Hague Rules, that make foreign
forum selection clauses unenforceable in the courts of those
are usually greater when litigants are forced to cross that boundary. I
think Carnival Cruise was wrongly decided, but adherence to the holding
in that case does not require the result the majority reaches today.

countries. See ante, at 537. The majority assumes (with-out citing any evidence) that these statutes were passed in

order to depart from the Hague Rules, and that COGSA, ourNation's enactment of the Hague Rules, should therefore be
read to mean something different from these statutes. Ithink the opposite conclusion is at least as plausible: These
foreign nations believed nonenforcement of foreign forumselection clauses was consistent with their international obligations, and they passed these statutes to make that explicit.If anything, then, these statutes demonstrate that several
foreign countries agree that the United States courts' con-sistent interpretation of COGSA does not contravene our
mutual treaty obligations. Moreover, because Congress ispresumed to know the law, Cannon v. University of Chicago,
441 U. S. 677, 696-699 (1979), it has been justified in assum-ing, based on the courts' uniform interpretation of COGSA
prior to today, that no specific statute such as Australia'sor South Africa's was necessary to invalidate foreign forum
selection and arbitration clauses. The existence of theseforeign statutes, then, proves nothing at all.

14

III
Lurking in the background of the Court's decision today isanother possible reason for holding, despite the clear meaning of COGSA and decades of precedent, that a foreign arbi-tration clause does not lessen liability. It may be that the
Court does violence to COGSA in order to avoid a perceivedconflict with another federal statute, the Federal Arbitration
Act (FAA), 9 U. S. C. $ 1 et seq. (1988 ed. and Supp. V). TheFAA requires that courts enforce arbitration clauses in contracts--including those requiring arbitration in foreign coun14 The majority's puzzling reference to the United Nations Convention
on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, ante, at
538, strikes me as irrelevant. Nothing in that treaty even remotely suggests an intent to enforce arbitration clauses that constitute a "lessening"
of liability under COGSA or the Hague Rules.

tries--the same way they would enforce any other contrac-tual clause. See,

e. g., Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v.
Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ., 489U. S. 468, 478 (1989). This statute was designed to overturn

the traditional common-law hostility to arbitration clauses.
See Mastrobuono v. Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc., 514U. S. 52, 55 (1995);

Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. v. Dobson,
513 U. S. 265, 270 (1995). According to the Court of Ap-peals, reading COGSA to invalidate foreign arbitration

clauses would conflict directly with the terms and policy ofthe FAA.

Unfortunately, in adopting a contrary reading to avoid thisconflict, the Court has today deprived COGSA $ 3(8) of much
of its force. The Court's narrow reading of "lessening [of]
liability" excludes more than arbitration; it apparently cov-ers only formal, legal liability. See

supra, at 551-552. Although I agree with the Court that it is important to readpotentially conflicting statutes so as to give effect to both

wherever possible, I think the majority has ignored a muchless damaging way to harmonize COGSA with the FAA.

Section 2 of the FAA reads:

"A written provision in any maritime transaction . . . to
settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising outof such contract . . . shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or inequity for the revocation of any contract." 9 U. S. C.

$ 2.
This language plainly intends to place arbitration clauses
upon the same footing as all other contractual clauses.
Thus, like any clause, an arbitration clause is enforceable,
"save upon such grounds" as would suffice to invalidate any
other, nonarbitration clause. The FAA thereby fulfills its
policy of jettisoning the prior regime of hostility to arbitration. Like any other contractual clause, then, an arbitration
clause may be invalid without violating the FAA if, for exam515us2$82i 08-25-98 19:29:02 PAGES OPINPGT

Stevens, J., dissenting

ple, it is procured through fraud or forgery; there is mutualmistake or impossibility; the provision is unconscionable; or,

as in this case, the terms of the clause are illegal under aseparate federal statute which does not evidence a hostility
to arbitration. Neither the terms nor the policies of theFAA would be thwarted if the Court were to hold today that
a foreign arbitration clause in a bill of lading "lessens liabil-ity" under COGSA. COGSA does not single out arbitration
clauses for disfavored treatment; it invalidates any clausethat lessens the carrier's liability. Illegality under COGSA
is therefore an independent ground "for the revocation of anycontract," under FAA $ 2. There is no conflict between the
two federal statutes.The correctness of this construction becomes even more
apparent when one considers the policies of the two statutes.COGSA seeks to ameliorate the inequality in bargaining power that comes from a particular form of adhesion con-tract. The FAA seeks to ensure enforcement of freely negotiated agreements to arbitrate. Volt, 489 U. S., at 478-479.As I have discussed,

supra, at 543-544, 550, foreign arbitra-tion clauses in bills of lading are not freely negotiated.

COGSA's policy is thus directly served by making theseclauses illegal; and the FAA's policy is not disserved thereby.
In contrast, allowing such adhesionary clauses to standserves the goals of neither statute.

IV
The Court's decision in this case is an excellent exampleof overzealous formalism. By eschewing a commonsense

reading of "lessening [of] liability," the Court has drainedthose words of much of their potency. The result compounds, rather than contains, the Court's unfortunate mis-take in the

Carnival Cruise case.I respectfully dissent.

HURLEY et al. v. IRISH-AMERICAN GAY,LESBIAN AND BISEXUAL GROUP

OF BOSTON, INC., et al.
certiorari to the supreme judicial court ofmassachusetts

No. 94-749. Argued April 25, 1995--Decided June 19, 1995
Petitioner South Boston Allied War Veterans Council, an unincorporated

association of individuals elected from various veterans groups, was authorized by the city of Boston to organize and conduct the St. Patrick's
Day-Evacuation Day Parade. The Council refused a place in the 1993
event to respondent GLIB, an organization formed for the purpose of
marching in the parade in order to express its members' pride in their
Irish heritage as openly gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals, to show
that there are such individuals in the community, and to support the
like men and women who sought to march in the New York St. Patrick's
Day parade. GLIB and some of its members filed this suit in state
court, alleging that the denial of their application to march violated,
inter alia, a state law prohibiting discrimination on account of sexual
orientation in places of public accommodation. In finding such a violation and ordering the Council to include GLIB in the parade, the trial
court, among other things, concluded that the parade had no common
theme other than the involvement of the participants, and that, given
the Council's lack of selectivity in choosing parade participants and its
failure to circumscribe the marchers' messages, the parade lacked any
expressive purpose, such that GLIB's inclusion therein would not violate
the Council's First Amendment rights. The Supreme Judicial Court of
Massachusetts affirmed.

Held: The state courts' application of the Massachusetts public accommodations law to require private citizens who organize a parade to include
among the marchers a group imparting a message that the organizers
do not wish to convey violates the First Amendment. Pp. 566-581.

(a) Confronted with the state courts' conclusion that the factual characteristics of petitioners' activity place it within the realm of nonexpressive conduct, this Court has a constitutional duty to conduct an
independent examination of the record as a whole, without deference to
those courts, to assure that their judgment does not constitute a forbidden intrusion on the field of free expression. See, e. g., New York Times
Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254, 285. Pp. 566-568.

Syllabus

(b) The selection of contingents to make a parade is entitled to First
Amendment protection. Parades such as petitioners' are a form of protected expression because they include marchers who are making some
sort of collective point, not just to each other but to bystanders along
the way. Cf., e. g., Gregory v. Chicago, 394 U. S. 111, 112. Moreover,
such protection is not limited to a parade's banners and songs, but extends to symbolic acts. See, e. g., West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette,
319 U. S. 624, 632, 642. Although the Council has been rather lenient
in admitting participants to its parade, a private speaker does not forfeit
constitutional protection simply by combining multifarious voices, by
failing to edit their themes to isolate a specific message as the exclusive
subject matter of the speech, or by failing to generate, as an original
matter, each item featured in the communication. Thus, petitioners are
entitled to protection under the First Amendment. GLIB's participation as a unit in the parade was equally expressive, since the organization was formed to celebrate its members' sexual identities and for related purposes. Pp. 568-570.

(c) The Massachusetts law does not, as a general matter, violate the
First or Fourteenth Amendments. Its provisions are well within a legislature's power to enact when it has reason to believe that a given
group is being discriminated against. And the statute does not, on
its face, target speech or discriminate on the basis of its content.
Pp. 571-572.

(d) The state court's application, however, had the effect of declaring
the sponsors' speech itself to be the public accommodation. Since every
participating parade unit affects the message conveyed by the private
organizers, the state courts' peculiar application of the Massachusetts
law essentially forced the Council to alter the parade's expressive content and thereby violated the fundamental First Amendment rule that
a speaker has the autonomy to choose the content of his own message
and, conversely, to decide what not to say. Petitioners' claim to the
benefit of this principle is sound, since the Council selects the expressive units of the parade from potential participants and clearly decided
to exclude a message it did not like from the communication it chose to
make, and that is enough to invoke its right as a private speaker to
shape its expression by speaking on one subject while remaining silent
on another, free from state interference. The constitutional violation is
not saved by Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U. S. 622.
The Council is a speaker in its own right; a parade does not consist of
individual, unrelated segments that happen to be transmitted together
for individual selection by members of the audience; and there is no
assertion here that some speakers will be destroyed in the absence of

BISEXUAL GROUP OF BOSTON, INC.

Opinion of the Court

I
March 17 is set aside for two celebrations in South Boston.As early as 1737, some people in Boston observed the feast

of the apostle to Ireland, and since 1776 the day has markedthe evacuation of royal troops and Loyalists from the city,
prompted by the guns captured at Ticonderoga and set up onDorchester Heights under General Washington's command.
Washington himself reportedly drew on the earlier traditionin choosing "St. Patrick" as the response to "Boston," the
password used in the colonial lines on evacuation day. SeeJ. Crimmins, St. Patrick's Day: Its Celebration in New York
and other American Places, 1737-1845, pp. 15, 19 (1902); seegenerally 1 H. Commager & R. Morris, The Spirit of 'Seventy

Massachusetts did not officially designate March 17 as Evac-uation Day until 1938, see Mass. Gen. Laws $ 6:12K (1992),
the City Council of Boston had previously sponsored publiccelebrations of Evacuation Day, including notable commemorations on the centennial in 1876, and on the 125th anniver-sary in 1901, with its parade, salute, concert, and fireworks
display. See Celebration of the Centennial Anniversary ofthe Evacuation of Boston by the British Army (G. Ellis ed.

The tradition of formal sponsorship by the city came to anend in 1947, however, when Mayor James Michael Curley
himself granted authority to organize and conduct the St.Patrick's Day-Evacuation Day Parade to the petitioner South
Boston Allied War Veterans Council, an unincorporated asso-ciation of individuals elected from various South Boston veterans groups. Every year since that time, the Council hasapplied for and received a permit for the parade, which at
times has included as many as 20,000 marchers and drawn

up to 1 million watchers. No other applicant has ever ap-plied for that permit.

Id., at B9. Through 1992, the city
allowed the Council to use the city's official seal, and pro-vided printing services as well as direct funding.

In 1992, a number of gay, lesbian, and bisexual descendants
of the Irish immigrants joined together with other support-ers to form the respondent organization, GLIB, to march in

the parade as a way to express pride in their Irish heritageas openly gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals, to demonstrate that there are such men and women among those sodescended, and to express their solidarity with like individuals who sought to march in New York's St. Patrick's Day
Parade. Id., at B3; App. 51. Although the Council denied
GLIB's application to take part in the 1992 parade, GLIB
obtained a state-court order to include its contingent, which
marched "uneventfully" among that year's 10,000 participants and 750,000 spectators. App. to Pet. for Cert. B3,
and n. 4.

In 1993, after the Council had again refused to admit GLIB
to the upcoming parade, the organization and some of its
members filed this suit against the Council, the individual
petitioner John J. "Wacko" Hurley, and the city of Boston,
alleging violations of the State and Federal Constitutions
and of the state public accommodations law, which prohibits
"any distinction, discrimination or restriction on account of
. . . sexual orientation . . . relative to the admission of any
person to, or treatment in any place of public accommodation,
resort or amusement." Mass. Gen. Laws $ 272:98 (1992).
After finding that "[f]or at least the past 47 years, the Parade has traveled the same basic route along the public
streets of South Boston, providing entertainment, amusement, and recreation to participants and spectators alike,"
App. to Pet. for Cert. B5-B6, the state trial court ruled that
the parade fell within the statutory definition of a public accommodation, which includes "any place . . . which is open to
and accepts or solicits the patronage of the general public

and, without limiting the generality of this definition,whether or not it be . . . (6) a boardwalk or other public

highway [or] . . . (8) a place of public amusement, recrea-tion, sport, exercise or entertainment," Mass. Gen. Laws

$ 272:92A (1992). The court found that the Council had no
written criteria and employed no particular procedures foradmission, voted on new applications in batches, had occasionally admitted groups who simply showed up at the pa-rade without having submitted an application, and did "not
generally inquire into the specific messages or views of eachapplicant." App. to Pet. for Cert. B8-B9. The court consequently rejected the Council's contention that the parade
was "private" (in the sense of being exclusive), holding instead that "the lack of genuine selectivity in choosing participants and sponsors demonstrates that the Parade is a public
event." Id., at B6. It found the parade to be "eclectic,"
containing a wide variety of "patriotic, commercial, political,
moral, artistic, religious, athletic, public service, trade union,
and eleemosynary themes," as well as conflicting messages.
Id., at B24. While noting that the Council had indeed excluded the Ku Klux Klan and ROAR (an antibusing group),
id., at B7, it attributed little significance to these facts, concluding ultimately that "[t]he only common theme among the
participants and sponsors is their public involvement in the
Parade," id., at B24.

The court rejected the Council's assertion that the exclusion of "groups with sexual themes merely formalized [the
fact] that the Parade expresses traditional religious and social values," id., at B3, and found the Council's "final position
[to be] that GLIB would be excluded because of its values
and its message, i. e., its members' sexual orientation," id.,
at B4, n. 5, citing Tr. of Closing Arg. 43, 51-52 (Nov. 23, 1993).
This position, in the court's view, was not only violative of
the public accommodations law but "paradoxical" as well,
since "a proper celebration of St. Patrick's and Evacuation
Day requires diversity and inclusiveness." App. to Pet. for

Opinion of the Court
Cert. B24. The court rejected the notion that GLIB's ad-mission would trample on the Council's First Amendment

rights since the court understood that constitutional protec-tion of any interest in expressive association would "requir[e]
focus on a specific message, theme, or group" absent fromthe parade.

Ibid. "Given the [Council's] lack of selectivityin choosing participants and failure to circumscribe the

marchers' message," the court found it "impossible to discernany specific expressive purpose entitling the Parade to protection under the First Amendment." Id., at B25. It con-cluded that the parade is "not an exercise of [the Council's]
constitutionally protected right of expressive association,"but instead "an open recreational event that is subject to the
public accommodations law." Id., at B27.The court held that because the statute did not mandate
inclusion of GLIB but only prohibited discrimination basedon sexual orientation, any infringement on the Council's
right to expressive association was only "incidental" and "nogreater than necessary to accomplish the statute's legitimate
purpose" of eradicating discrimination. Id., at B25, citingRoberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U. S. 609, 628-629
(1984). Accordingly, it ruled that "GLIB is entitled to par-ticipate in the Parade on the same terms and conditions as
other participants." App. to Pet. for Cert. B27.1The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts affirmed,

city because it found that the city's actions did not amount to inciting or
assisting in the Council's violations of $ 272:98. App. to Pet. for Cert.
B12-B13. It also dismissed respondents' First and Fourteenth Amendment challenge against the Council for want of state action triggering the
proscriptions of those Amendments. Id., at B14-B22. Finally, the court
did not reach the state constitutional questions, since respondents had
apparently assumed in their arguments that those claims, too, depended
for their success upon a finding of state action and because of the court's
holding that the public accommodation statutes apply to the parade. Id.,

that GLIB was excluded from the parade based on the sexual
orientation of its members, that it was impossible to detect
an expressive purpose in the parade, that there was no state
action, and that the parade was a public accommodation
within the meaning of $ 272:92A. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston v. Boston, 418 Mass.
238, 242-248, 636 N. E. 2d 1293, 1295-1298 (1994).2 Turning
to petitioners' First Amendment claim that application of the
public accommodations law to the parade violated their freedom of speech (as distinguished from their right to expressive association, raised in the trial court), the court's majority held that it need not decide on the particular First
Amendment theory involved "because, as the [trial] judge
found, it is `impossible to discern any specific expressive purpose entitling the Parade to protection under the First
Amendment.' " Id., at 249, 636 N. E. 2d, at 1299 (footnote
omitted). The defendants had thus failed at the trial level
"to demonstrate that the parade truly was an exercise of . . .
First Amendment rights," id., at 250, 636 N. E. 2d, at 1299,
citing Clark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence, 468
U. S. 288, 293, n. 5 (1984), and on appeal nothing indicated to
the majority of the Supreme Judicial Court that the trial
judge's assessment of the evidence on this point was clearly
erroneous, 418 Mass., at 250, 636 N. E. 2d, at 1299. The
court rejected petitioners' further challenge to the law as
overbroad, holding that it does not, on its face, regulate
speech, does not let public officials examine the content of
speech, and would not be interpreted as reaching speech.
Id., at 251-252, 636 N. E. 2d, at 1300. Finally, the court
rejected the challenge that the public accommodations law
was unconstitutionally vague, holding that this case did not
present an issue of speech and that the law gave persons of

ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know whatwas prohibited.

Id., at 252, 636 N. E. 2d, at 1300-1301.
Justice Nolan dissented. In his view, the Council "doesnot need a narrow or distinct theme or message in its parade

for it to be protected under the First Amendment." Id., at
256, 636 N. E. 2d, at 1303. First, he wrote, even if the pa-rade had no message at all, GLIB's particular message could

not be forced upon it. Id., at 257, 636 N. E. 2d, at 1303,citing

Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U. S. 705, 717 (1977) (state
requirement to display "Live Free or Die" on license platesviolates First Amendment). Second, according to Justice

Nolan, the trial judge clearly erred in finding the parade devoid of expressive purpose. 418 Mass., at 257, 636 N. E. 2d,
at 1303. He would have held that the Council, like any expressive association, cannot be barred from excluding applicants who do not share the views the Council wishes to advance. Id., at 257-259, 636 N. E. 2d, at 1303-1304, citing
Roberts, supra. Under either a pure speech or associational
theory, the State's purpose of eliminating discrimination on
the basis of sexual orientation, according to the dissent, could
be achieved by more narrowly drawn means, such as ordering admission of individuals regardless of sexual preference,
without taking the further step of prohibiting the Council
from editing the views expressed in their parade. 418
Mass., at 256, 258, 636 N. E. 2d, at 1302, 1304. In Justice
Nolan's opinion, because GLIB's message was separable from
the status of its members, such a narrower order would accommodate the State's interest without the likelihood of infringing on the Council's First Amendment rights. Finally,
he found clear error in the trial judge's equation of exclusion
on the basis of GLIB's message with exclusion on the basis
of its members' sexual orientation. To the dissent this
appeared false in the light of "overwhelming evidence" that
the Council objected to GLIB on account of its message
and a dearth of testimony or documentation indicating that
sexual orientation was the bar to admission. Id., at 260, 636

Opinion of the Court

N. E. 2d, at 1304. The dissent accordingly concluded thatthe Council had not even violated the State's public accommodations law.We granted certiorari to determine whether the requirement to admit a parade contingent expressing a message notof the private organizers' own choosing violates the First
Amendment. 513 U. S. 1071 (1995). We hold that it doesand reverse.

II
Given the scope of the issues as originally joined in thiscase, it is worth noting some that have fallen aside in the

course of the litigation, before reaching us. Although theCouncil presents us with a First Amendment claim, respondents do not. Neither do they press a claim that the Council'saction has denied them equal protection of the laws in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. While the guaranteesof free speech and equal protection guard only against encroachment by the government and "erec[t] no shield againstmerely private conduct,"

Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U. S. 1, 13(1948); see Hudgens v. NLRB, 424 U. S. 507, 513 (1976), respondents originally argued that the Council's conduct wasnot purely private, but had the character of state action.
The trial court's review of the city's involvement led it tofind otherwise, however, and although the Supreme Judicial
Court did not squarely address the issue, it appears to haveaffirmed the trial court's decision on that point as well as the
others. In any event, respondents have not brought that
question up either in a cross-petition for certiorari or in theirbriefs filed in this Court. When asked at oral argument

whether they challenged the conclusion by the Massachusetts' courts that no state action is involved in the parade,respondents' counsel answered that they "do not press that

issue here." Tr. of Oral Arg. 22. In this Court, then, theirclaim for inclusion in the parade rests solely on the Massachusetts public accommodations law.

Opinion of the Court
There is no corresponding concession from the other side,
however, and certainly not to the state courts' characterization of the parade as lacking the element of expression for
purposes of the First Amendment. Accordingly, our review
of petitioners' claim that their activity is indeed in the nature
of protected speech carries with it a constitutional duty to
conduct an independent examination of the record as a
whole, without deference to the trial court. See Bose Corp.
v. Consumers Union of United States, Inc., 466 U. S. 485,
499 (1984). The "requirement of independent appellate review . . . is a rule of federal constitutional law," id., at 510,
which does not limit our deference to a trial court on matters
of witness credibility, Harte-Hanks Communications, Inc. v.
Connaughton, 491 U. S. 657, 688 (1989), but which generally
requires us to "review the finding of facts by a State court
. . . where a conclusion of law as to a Federal right and a
finding of fact are so intermingled as to make it necessary,
in order to pass upon the Federal question, to analyze the
facts," Fiske v. Kansas, 274 U. S. 380, 385-386 (1927). See
also Niemotko v. Maryland, 340 U. S. 268, 271 (1951); Jacobellis v. Ohio, 378 U. S. 184, 189 (1964) (opinion of Brennan,
J.). This obligation rests upon us simply because the
reaches of the First Amendment are ultimately defined by
the facts it is held to embrace, and we must thus decide for
ourselves whether a given course of conduct falls on the near
or far side of the line of constitutional protection. See Bose
Corp., supra, at 503. Even where a speech case has originally been tried in a federal court, subject to the provision
of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a) that "[f]indings of
fact . . . shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous," we
are obliged to make a fresh examination of crucial facts.
Hence, in this case, though we are confronted with the state
courts' conclusion that the factual characteristics of petitioners' activity place it within the vast realm of nonexpressive
conduct, our obligation is to " `make an independent examina515us2$83m 08-25-98 19:27:01 PAGES OPINPGT

tion of the whole record,' . . . so as to assure ourselves thatth[is] judgment does not constitute a forbidden intrusion on

the field of free expression." New York Times Co. v. Sul-livan, 376 U. S. 254, 285 (1964) (footnote omitted), quoting
Edwards v. South Carolina, 372 U. S. 229, 235 (1963).

If there were no reason for a group of people to marchfrom here to there except to reach a destination, they could

make the trip without expressing any message beyond thefact of the march itself. Some people might call such a procession a parade, but it would not be much of one. Real"[p]arades are public dramas of social relations, and in them
performers define who can be a social actor and what sub-jects and ideas are available for communication and consideration." S. Davis, Parades and Power: Street Theatre inNineteenth-Century Philadelphia 6 (1986). Hence, we use
the word "parade" to indicate marchers who are makingsome sort of collective point, not just to each other but to
bystanders along the way. Indeed, a parade's dependenceon watchers is so extreme that nowadays, as with Bishop
Berkeley's celebrated tree, "if a parade or demonstration re-ceives no media coverage, it may as well not have happened."
Id., at 171. Parades are thus a form of expression, not justmotion, and the inherent expressiveness of marching to make
a point explains our cases involving protest marches. In
Gregory v. Chicago, 394 U. S. 111, 112 (1969), for example,petitioners had taken part in a procession to express their

grievances to the city government, and we held that such a"march, if peaceful and orderly, falls well within the sphere
of conduct protected by the First Amendment." Similarly,in

Edwards v. South Carolina, supra, at 235, where petition-ers had joined in a march of protest and pride, carrying placards and singing The Star Spangled Banner, we held thatthe activities "reflect an exercise of these basic constitutional

Opinion of the Court
rights in their most pristine and classic form." Accord,
Shuttlesworth v. Birmingham, 394 U. S. 147, 152 (1969).

The protected expression that inheres in a parade is notlimited to its banners and songs, however, for the Constitution looks beyond written or spoken words as mediums of
expression. Noting that "[s]ymbolism is a primitive but ef-fective way of communicating ideas,"

West Virginia Bd. of
Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U. S. 624, 632 (1943), our cases have rec-ognized that the First Amendment shields such acts as saluting a flag (and refusing to do so), id., at 632, 642, wearing anarmband to protest a war,

Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School Dist., 393 U. S. 503, 505-506 (1969),
displaying a red flag, Stromberg v. California, 283 U. S. 359,
369 (1931), and even "[m]arching, walking or parading" in
uniforms displaying the swastika, National Socialist Party
of America v. Skokie, 432 U. S. 43 (1977). As some of these
examples show, a narrow, succinctly articulable message is
not a condition of constitutional protection, which if confined
to expressions conveying a "particularized message," cf.
Spence v. Washington, 418 U. S. 405, 411 (1974) (per curiam),
would never reach the unquestionably shielded painting of
Jackson Pollock, music of Arnold Schoenberg, or Jabberwocky verse of Lewis Carroll.

Not many marches, then, are beyond the realm of expressive parades, and the South Boston celebration is not one of
them. Spectators line the streets; people march in costumes
and uniforms, carrying flags and banners with all sorts of
messages (e. g., "England get out of Ireland," "Say no to
drugs"); marching bands and pipers play; floats are pulled
along; and the whole show is broadcast over Boston television. See Record, Exh. 84 (video). To be sure, we agree
with the state courts that in spite of excluding some applicants, the Council is rather lenient in admitting participants.
But a private speaker does not forfeit constitutional protection simply by combining multifarious voices, or by failing to
edit their themes to isolate an exact message as the exclusive

Opinion of the Court

subject matter of the speech. Nor, under our precedent,does First Amendment protection require a speaker to generate, as an original matter, each item featured in the com-munication. Cable operators, for example, are engaged in
protected speech activities even when they only select programming originally produced by others. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U. S. 622, 636 (1994) ("Cable
programmers and cable operators engage in and transmitspeech, and they are entitled to the protection of the speech

and press provisions of the First Amendment"). For thatmatter, the presentation of an edited compilation of speech
generated by other persons is a staple of most newspapers'
opinion pages, which, of course, fall squarely within the core
of First Amendment security, Miami Herald Publishing Co.
v. Tornillo, 418 U. S. 241, 258 (1974), as does even the simple
selection of a paid noncommercial advertisement for inclusion in a daily paper, see New York Times, 376 U. S., at 265-
266. The selection of contingents to make a parade is entitled to similar protection.

Respondents' participation as a unit in the parade was
equally expressive. GLIB was formed for the very purpose
of marching in it, as the trial court found, in order to celebrate its members' identity as openly gay, lesbian, and bisexual descendants of the Irish immigrants, to show that there
are such individuals in the community, and to support the
like men and women who sought to march in the New York
parade. App. to Pet. for Cert. B3. The organization distributed a fact sheet describing the members' intentions,
App. A51, and the record otherwise corroborates the expressive nature of GLIB's participation, see Record, Exh. 84
(video); App. A67 (photograph). In 1993, members of GLIB
marched behind a shamrock-strewn banner with the simple
inscription "Irish American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual
Group of Boston." GLIB understandably seeks to communicate its ideas as part of the existing parade, rather than staging one of its own.

The Massachusetts public accommodations law underwhich respondents brought suit has a venerable history. At

common law, innkeepers, smiths, and others who "made pro-fession of a public employment," were prohibited from refusing, without good reason, to serve a customer. Lane v.
Cotton, 12 Mod. 472, 484-485, 88 Eng. Rep. 1458, 1464-1465(K. B. 1701) (Holt, C. J.); see Bell v. Maryland, 378 U. S.

226, 298, n. 17 (1964) (Goldberg, J., concurring); Lombard v.
Louisiana, 373 U. S. 267, 277 (1963) (Douglas, J., concurring).As one of the 19th-century English judges put it, the rule

was that "[t]he innkeeper is not to select his guests[;] [h]ehas no right to say to one, you shall come into my inn, and
to another you shall not, as every one coming and conductinghimself in a proper manner has a right to be received; and
for this purpose innkeepers are a sort of public servants."
Rex v. Ivens, 7 Car. & P. 213, 219, 173 Eng. Rep. 94, 96 (N. P.1835); M. Konvitz & T. Leskes, A Century of Civil Rights

160 (1961).After the Civil War, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts
was the first State to codify this principle to ensure accessto public accommodations regardless of race. See Act Forbidding Unjust Discrimination on Account of Color or Race,1865 Mass. Acts, ch. 277 (May 16, 1865); Konvitz & Leskes,

place of amusement, public conveyance or public meeting,"1865 Mass. Acts, ch. 277, $ 1, the original statute already expanded upon the common law, which had not conferred anyright of access to places of public amusement, Lerman &

Opinion of the Court

broaden the scope of legislation, to the point that the lawtoday prohibits discrimination on the basis of "race, color,

religious creed, national origin, sex, sexual orientation . . . ,deafness, blindness or any physical or mental disability or
ancestry" in "the admission of any person to, or treatmentin any place of public accommodation, resort or amusement."
Mass. Gen. Laws $ 272:98 (1992). Provisions like these arewell within the State's usual power to enact when a legislature has reason to believe that a given group is the target ofdiscrimination, and they do not, as a general matter, violate
the First or Fourteenth Amendments. See, e. g., New York
State Club Assn., Inc. v. City of New York, 487 U. S. 1, 11-16(1988);

Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U. S., at 624-626; Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, 379 U. S.

241, 258-262 (1964). Nor is this statute unusual in any obvi-ous way, since it does not, on its face, target speech or discriminate on the basis of its content, the focal point of itsprohibition being rather on the act of discriminating against
individuals in the provision of publicly available goods, privi-leges, and services on the proscribed grounds.

C
In the case before us, however, the Massachusetts law hasbeen applied in a peculiar way. Its enforcement does not

address any dispute about the participation of openly gay,lesbian, or bisexual individuals in various units admitted to
the parade. Petitioners disclaim any intent to exclude ho-mosexuals as such, and no individual member of GLIB claims
to have been excluded from parading as a member of anygroup that the Council has approved to march. Instead, the
disagreement goes to the admission of GLIB as its own pa-rade unit carrying its own banner. See App. to Pet. for
Cert. B26-B27, and n. 28. Since every participating unit af-fects the message conveyed by the private organizers, the
state courts' application of the statute produced an order es-sentially requiring petitioners to alter the expressive content

of their parade. Although the state courts spoke of the pa-rade as a place of public accommodation, see,

e. g., 418 Mass.,
at 247-248, 636 N. E. 2d, at 1297-1298, once the expressivecharacter of both the parade and the marching GLIB contingent is understood, it becomes apparent that the state courts'
application of the statute had the effect of declaring thesponsors' speech itself to be the public accommodation.

Under this approach any contingent of protected individualswith a message would have the right to participate in petitioners' speech, so that the communication produced by theprivate organizers would be shaped by all those protected
by the law who wished to join in with some expressive demonstration of their own. But this use of the State's power
violates the fundamental rule of protection under the First
Amendment, that a speaker has the autonomy to choose the
content of his own message.

"Since all speech inherently involves choices of what to
say and what to leave unsaid," Pacific Gas & Electric Co. v.
Public Utilities Comm'n of Cal., 475 U. S. 1, 11 (1986) (plurality opinion) (emphasis in original), one important manifestation of the principle of free speech is that one who chooses
to speak may also decide "what not to say," id., at 16. Although the State may at times "prescribe what shall be orthodox in commercial advertising" by requiring the dissemination of "purely factual and uncontroversial information,"
Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel of Supreme
Court of Ohio, 471 U. S. 626, 651 (1985); see Pittsburgh Press
Co. v. Pittsburgh Comm'n on Human Relations, 413 U. S.
376, 386-387 (1973), outside that context it may not compel
affirmance of a belief with which the speaker disagrees, see
Barnette, 319 U. S., at 642. Indeed this general rule, that
the speaker has the right to tailor the speech, applies not
only to expressions of value, opinion, or endorsement, but
equally to statements of fact the speaker would rather avoid,

New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376

Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Falwell, 485 U. S.
46 (1988). Nor is the rule's benefit restricted to the press,
being enjoyed by business corporations generally and by or-dinary people engaged in unsophisticated expression as well

as by professional publishers. Its point is simply the pointof all speech protection, which is to shield just those choices
of content that in someone's eyes are misguided, or evenhurtful. See

Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U. S. 444 (1969);
Terminiello v. Chicago, 337 U. S. 1 (1949).

Petitioners' claim to the benefit of this principle of autonomy to control one's own speech is as sound as the South
Boston parade is expressive. Rather like a composer, the
Council selects the expressive units of the parade from potential participants, and though the score may not produce a
particularized message, each contingent's expression in the
Council's eyes comports with what merits celebration on that
day. Even if this view gives the Council credit for a more
considered judgment than it actively made, the Council
clearly decided to exclude a message it did not like from the
communication it chose to make, and that is enough to invoke
its right as a private speaker to shape its expression by
speaking on one subject while remaining silent on another.
The message it disfavored is not difficult to identify. Although GLIB's point (like the Council's) is not wholly articulate, a contingent marching behind the organization's banner
would at least bear witness to the fact that some Irish are
gay, lesbian, or bisexual, and the presence of the organized
marchers would suggest their view that people of their sexual orientations have as much claim to unqualified social acceptance as heterosexuals and indeed as members of parade
units organized around other identifying characteristics.
The parade's organizers may not believe these facts about
Irish sexuality to be so, or they may object to unqualified

Opinion of the Court
social acceptance of gays and lesbians or have some otherreason for wishing to keep GLIB's message out of the parade. But whatever the reason, it boils down to the choiceof a speaker not to propound a particular point of view, and
that choice is presumed to lie beyond the government's
power to control.Respondents argue that any tension between this rule and

the Massachusetts law falls short of unconstitutionality, cit-ing the most recent of our cases on the general subject of
compelled access for expressive purposes, Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U. S. 622 (1994). There we
reviewed regulations requiring cable operators to set aside
channels for designated broadcast signals, and applied only
intermediate scrutiny. Id., at 662. Respondents contend
on this authority that admission of GLIB to the parade would
not threaten the core principle of speaker's autonomy because the Council, like a cable operator, is merely "a conduit"
for the speech of participants in the parade "rather than itself a speaker." Brief for Respondents 21. But this metaphor is not apt here, because GLIB's participation would
likely be perceived as having resulted from the Council's customary determination about a unit admitted to the parade,
that its message was worthy of presentation and quite possibly of support as well. A newspaper, similarly, "is more
than a passive receptacle or conduit for news, comment, and
advertising," and we have held that "[t]he choice of material
. . . and the decisions made as to limitations on the size and
content . . . and treatment of public issues . . .--whether
fair or unfair--constitute the exercise of editorial control and
judgment" upon which the State can not intrude. Tornillo,
418 U. S., at 258. Indeed, in Pacific Gas & Electric, we invalidated coerced access to the envelope of a private utility's
bill and newsletter because the utility "may be forced either
to appear to agree with [the intruding leaflet] or to respond."
475 U. S., at 15 (plurality opinion) (citation omitted). The
plurality made the further point that if "the government

[were] freely able to compel . . . speakers to propound politi-cal messages with which they disagree, . . . protection [of a

speaker's freedom] would be empty, for the governmentcould require speakers to affirm in one breath that which
they deny in the next." Id., at 16. Thus, when dissemination of a view contrary to one's own is forced upon aspeaker intimately connected with the communication advanced, the speaker's right to autonomy over the messageis compromised.

In Turner Broadcasting, we found this problem absent inthe cable context, because "[g]iven cable's long history of
serving as a conduit for broadcast signals, there appears little risk that cable viewers would assume that the broadcast
stations carried on a cable system convey ideas or messages
endorsed by the cable operator." 512 U. S., at 655. We
stressed that the viewer is frequently apprised of the identity of the broadcaster whose signal is being received via
cable and that it is "common practice for broadcasters to disclaim any identity of viewpoint between the management
and the speakers who use the broadcast facility." Ibid. (citation omitted); see id., at 684 (O'Connor, J., concurring in
part and dissenting in part) (noting that Congress "might . . .
conceivably obligate cable operators to act as common carriers for some of their channels").

Parades and demonstrations, in contrast, are not understood to be so neutrally presented or selectively viewed. Unlike the programming offered on various channels by a cable
network, the parade does not consist of individual, unrelated
segments that happen to be transmitted together for individual selection by members of the audience. Although each
parade unit generally identifies itself, each is understood to
contribute something to a common theme, and accordingly
there is no customary practice whereby private sponsors disavow "any identity of viewpoint" between themselves and
the selected participants. Practice follows practicability
here, for such disclaimers would be quite curious in a moving

parade. Cf. PruneYard Shopping Center v. Robins, 447U. S. 74, 87 (1980) (owner of shopping mall "can expressly

disavow any connection with the message by simply postingsigns in the area where the speakers or handbillers stand").
Without deciding on the precise significance of the likelihood
of misattribution, it nonetheless becomes clear that in thecontext of an expressive parade, as with a protest march,

the parade's overall message is distilled from the individualpresentations along the way, and each unit's expression is
perceived by spectators as part of the whole.An additional distinction between

Turner Broadcasting
and this case points to the fundamental weakness of any attempt to justify the state-court order's limitation on the
Council's autonomy as a speaker. A cable is not only a conduit for speech produced by others and selected by cable operators for transmission, but a franchised channel giving
monopolistic opportunity to shut out some speakers. This
power gives rise to the Government's interest in limiting
monopolistic autonomy in order to allow for the survival
of broadcasters who might otherwise be silenced and consequently destroyed. The Government's interest in Turner
Broadcasting was not the alteration of speech, but the survival of speakers. In thus identifying an interest going beyond abridgment of speech itself, the defenders of the law at
issue in Turner Broadcasting addressed the threshold requirement of any review under the Speech Clause, whatever
the ultimate level of scrutiny, that a challenged restriction
on speech serve a compelling, or at least important, governmental object, see, e. g., Pacific Gas & Electric, supra, at
19; Turner Broadcasting, supra, at 662; United States v.
O'Brien, 391 U. S. 367, 377 (1968).

In this case, of course, there is no assertion comparable to
the Turner Broadcasting claim that some speakers will be
destroyed in the absence of the challenged law. True, the
size and success of petitioners' parade makes it an enviable
vehicle for the dissemination of GLIB's views, but that fact,

BISEXUAL GROUP OF BOSTON, INC.

Opinion of the Court

without more, would fall far short of supporting a claim thatpetitioners enjoy an abiding monopoly of access to spectators. See App. to Pet. for Cert. B9; Brief for Respondents10 (citing trial court's finding that no other applicant has applied for the permit). Considering that GLIB presumably
would have had a fair shot (under neutral criteria developedby the city) at obtaining a parade permit of its own, respondents have not shown that petitioners enjoy the capacity to"silence the voice of competing speakers," as cable operators
do with respect to program providers who wish to reach sub-scribers,

Turner Broadcasting, supra, at 656. Nor has any
other legitimate interest been identified in support of applying the Massachusetts statute in this way to expressive activity like the parade.

The statute, Mass. Gen. Laws $ 272:98 (1992), is a piece of
protective legislation that announces no purpose beyond the
object both expressed and apparent in its provisions, which
is to prevent any denial of access to (or discriminatory treatment in) public accommodations on proscribed grounds, including sexual orientation. On its face, the object of the law
is to ensure by statute for gays and lesbians desiring to make
use of public accommodations what the old common law
promised to any member of the public wanting a meal at the
inn, that accepting the usual terms of service, they will not
be turned away merely on the proprietor's exercise of personal preference. When the law is applied to expressive activity in the way it was done here, its apparent object is
simply to require speakers to modify the content of their
expression to whatever extent beneficiaries of the law choose
to alter it with messages of their own. But in the absence
of some further, legitimate end, this object is merely to allow
exactly what the general rule of speaker's autonomy forbids.

It might, of course, have been argued that a broader objective is apparent: that the ultimate point of forbidding acts of
discrimination toward certain classes is to produce a society
free of the corresponding biases. Requiring access to a

579Cite as: 515 U. S. 557 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
speaker's message would thus be not an end in itself, but ameans to produce speakers free of the biases, whose expressive conduct would be at least neutral toward the particularclasses, obviating any future need for correction. But if this
indeed is the point of applying the state law to expressive
conduct, it is a decidedly fatal objective. Having availed it-self of the public thoroughfares "for purposes of assembly

[and] communicating thoughts between citizens," the Councilis engaged in a use of the streets that has "from ancient
times, been a part of the privileges, immunities, rights, andliberties of citizens."

Hague v. Committee for Industrial
Organization, 307 U. S. 496, 515 (1939) (opinion of Roberts,
J.). Our tradition of free speech commands that a speaker

who takes to the street corner to express his views in this
way should be free from interference by the State based on
the content of what he says. See, e. g., Police Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U. S. 92, 95 (1972); cf. H. Kalven, A Worthy Tradition 6-19 (1988); Fiss, Free Speech and Social
Structure, 71 Iowa L. Rev. 1405, 1408-1409 (1986). The very
idea that a noncommercial speech restriction be used to
produce thoughts and statements acceptable to some groups
or, indeed, all people, grates on the First Amendment, for it
amounts to nothing less than a proposal to limit speech in
the service of orthodox expression. The Speech Clause has
no more certain antithesis. See, e. g., Barnette, 319 U. S., at
642; Pacific Gas & Electric, 475 U. S., at 20. While the law
is free to promote all sorts of conduct in place of harmful
behavior, it is not free to interfere with speech for no better
reason than promoting an approved message or discouraging
a disfavored one, however enlightened either purpose may
strike the government.

Far from supporting GLIB, then, Turner Broadcasting
points to the reasons why the present application of the
Massachusetts law can not be sustained. So do the two
other principal authorities GLIB has cited. In PruneYard Shopping Center v. Robins, supra, to be sure, we

515us2$83m 08-25-98 19:27:01 PAGES OPINPGT
580 HURLEY v. IRISH-AMERICAN GAY, LESBIAN AND

BISEXUAL GROUP OF BOSTON, INC.

Opinion of the Court

sustained a state law requiring the proprietors of shoppingmalls to allow visitors to solicit signatures on political petitions without a showing that the shopping mall ownerswould otherwise prevent the beneficiaries of the law from
reaching an audience. But we found in that case that the
proprietors were running "a business establishment that isopen to the public to come and go as they please," that the

solicitations would "not likely be identified with those of theowner," and that the proprietors could "expressly disavow
any connection with the message by simply posting signsin the area where the speakers or handbillers stand." 447
U. S., at 87. Also, in Pacific Gas & Electric, supra, at 12,
we noted that PruneYard did not involve "any concern that
access to this area might affect the shopping center owner's
exercise of his own right to speak: the owner did not even
allege that he objected to the content of the pamphlets . . . ."
The principle of speaker's autonomy was simply not threatened in that case.

New York State Club Assn. is also instructive by the contrast it provides. There, we turned back a facial challenge
to a state antidiscrimination statute on the assumption that
the expressive associational character of a dining club with
over 400 members could be sufficiently attenuated to permit
application of the law even to such a private organization,
but we also recognized that the State did not prohibit exclusion of those whose views were at odds with positions espoused by the general club memberships. 487 U. S., at 13;
see also Roberts, 468 U. S., at 627. In other words, although
the association provided public benefits to which a State
could ensure equal access, it was also engaged in expressive
activity; compelled access to the benefit, which was upheld,
did not trespass on the organization's message itself. If we
were to analyze this case strictly along those lines, GLIB
would lose. Assuming the parade to be large enough and
a source of benefits (apart from its expression) that would
generally justify a mandated access provision, GLIB could

Opinion of the Court
nonetheless be refused admission as an expressive contin-gent with its own message just as readily as a private club

could exclude an applicant whose manifest views were atodds with a position taken by the club's existing members.

IV
Our holding today rests not on any particular view aboutthe Council's message but on the Nation's commitment to

protect freedom of speech. Disapproval of a private speak-er's statement does not legitimize use of the Commonwealth's power to compel the speaker to alter the messageby including one more acceptable to others. Accordingly,
the judgment of the Supreme Judicial Court is reversed, andthe case is remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with
this opinion. It is so ordered.

NATIONAL PRIVATE TRUCK COUNCIL, INC., et al.

v. OKLAHOMA TAX COMMISSION et al.

certiorari to the supreme court of oklahoma

No. 94-688. Argued April 18, 1995--Decided June 19, 1995
In the Oklahoma state courts, petitioners successfully challenged certain

state taxes as violating the "dormant" Commerce Clause. The Oklahoma Supreme Court ordered respondents to award refunds pursuant
to state law, but declined to award declaratory or injunctive relief under
42 U. S. C. $ 1983 or attorney's fees under $ 1988. The court reasoned
that because adequate remedies existed under state law, the Tax Injunction Act would have precluded petitioners from seeking an injunction in
federal court; although that Act does not apply to state courts, the Oklahoma Supreme Court invoked the principle of "intrastate uniformity" to
conclude that petitioners were not entitled to injunctive or declaratory
relief under $ 1983.

Held:

1. Section 1983 provides no basis for courts to issue injunctive or
declaratory relief in state tax cases when there is an adequate remedy
at law. This Court has long held that courts should adopt a hands-off
approach with respect to state tax administration. Dows v. Chicago,
11 Wall. 108, 110. In passing $ 1983, Congress did not limit this strong
background principle of noninterference with state taxation. Construing $ 1983 with this principle in mind, the Court concludes that $ 1983
does not call for courts--whether federal or state--to disrupt state tax
administration by issuing injunctive or declaratory relief when state law
furnishes an adequate legal remedy. Pp. 588-592.

2. Since no relief could be awarded under $ 1983, no attorney's fees
can be awarded under $ 1988. P. 592.

879 P. 2d 137, affirmed.

state law, it also held that petitioners were not entitled to
declaratory or injunctive relief under Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42
U. S. C. $ 1983, and, accordingly, that they could not obtain
attorney's fees under 42 U. S. C. $ 1988(b) (1988 ed., Supp. V).
Petitioners argue that this holding violates the Supremacy
Clause, U. S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2. We affirm.

I
In 1983, Oklahoma imposed third-structure taxes against
motor carriers with vehicles registered in any of 25 States.1
It did so in order to retaliate against those States that had
imposed discriminatory taxes against trucks registered in
Oklahoma. In December 1984, petitioners filed a class action in an Oklahoma trial court, arguing that the taxes violated the dormant Commerce Clause and the Privileges and
Immunities Clause of Art. IV, $ 2, cl. 1. Pursuant to state
law and $ 1983, petitioners sought declaratory and injunctive
relief as well as refunds of taxes paid. In addition, they
sought attorney's fees under both state law and $ 1988.2

1 Third-structure taxes are those nonregistration, nonfuel taxes that are
neither apportioned nor prorated. One example of a third-structure tax
is an axle tax, which imposes a flat charge based on the number of axles
per vehicle. See Private Truck Council v. Oklahoma Tax Comm'n, 806
P. 2d 598, 600-601 (Okla. 1990).

2 Section 1983 provides:

"Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other

Opinion of the Court
The trial court upheld the constitutionality of the taxes,but the Oklahoma Supreme Court reversed and held that

the taxes were invalid under our dormant Commerce Clausejurisprudence. Private Truck Council v. Oklahoma Tax
Comm'n, 806 P. 2d 598 (1990). The court awarded refundsunder state law, but declined to award relief under $ 1983
and declined to award attorney's fees under $ 1988. In soruling, it relied on

Consolidated Freightways Corp. v. Kas-sel, 730 F. 2d 1139 (CA8), cert. denied, 469 U. S. 834 (1984),

which held that $ 1983 may not be used to secure remediesfor dormant Commerce Clause violations.

After the Oklahoma Supreme Court's decision, we heldthat one of the "rights, privileges or immunities" protected
by $ 1983 was the right to be free from state action thatviolates the dormant Commerce Clause. See

Dennis v. Hig-gins, 498 U. S. 439 (1991). Accordingly, we granted the taxpayers' petition for certiorari, vacated the judgment, and re-manded the case for further consideration in light of Dennis.
501 U. S. 1247 (1991).On remand, the Oklahoma Supreme Court once again held
that petitioners were not entitled to relief under $ 1983. 879P. 2d 137 (1994). The court noted that because adequate
remedies existed under state law, the Tax Injunction Act, 28U. S. C. $ 1341, would have precluded petitioners from seeking an injunction in federal court. 879 P. 2d, at 140-141.Although the Tax Injunction Act does not apply in state
courts, the Oklahoma Supreme Court relied upon the princi-ple of "intrastate uniformity" to conclude that a state court
need not grant injunctive or declaratory relief under $ 1983when such remedies would not be available in federal court.
Id., at 141 (quoting Felder v. Casey, 487 U. S. 131, 153 (1988)).We granted certiorari to resolve a conflict among the state
courts as to whether, in tax cases, state courts must provide

relief under $ 1983 when adequate remedies exist under
state law.3

II

We have long recognized that principles of federalism and
comity generally counsel that courts should adopt a hands-off
approach with respect to state tax administration. Immediately prior to the enactment of $ 1983, the Court articulated
the reasons behind the reluctance to interfere:

"It is upon taxation that the several States chiefly rely
to obtain the means to carry on their respective governments, and it is of the utmost importance to all of them
that the modes adopted to enforce the taxes levied
should be interfered with as little as possible." Dows
v. Chicago, 11 Wall. 108, 110 (1871).

Since the passage of $ 1983, Congress and this Court repeatedly have shown an aversion to federal interference with
state tax administration. The passage of the Tax Injunction
Act in 1937 is one manifestation of this aversion. See 28
U. S. C. $ 1341 (prohibiting federal courts from enjoining the
collection of any state tax "where a plain, speedy and efficient remedy may be had in the courts of such State"). We
subsequently relied upon the Act's spirit to extend the prohibition from injunctions to declaratory judgments regarding the constitutionality of state taxes. See Great Lakes
Dredge & Dock Co. v. Huffman, 319 U. S. 293 (1943). Later,
we held that the Tax Injunction Act itself precluded district
courts from awarding such declaratory judgments. See Cal3 Compare Zizka v. Water Pollution Control Authority, 195 Conn. 682,
490 A. 2d 509 (1985) (States need not provide $ 1983 remedy in state tax
cases) and Backus v. Chilivis, 236 Ga. 500, 224 S. E. 2d 370 (1976) (same),

The reluctance to interfere with state tax collection con-tinued in McKesson Corp. v. Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco, Fla. Dept. of Business Regulation, 496U. S. 18 (1990), in which we confirmed that the States are
afforded great flexibility in satisfying the requirements ofdue process in the field of taxation. As long as state law
provides a " `clear and certain remedy,' " id., at 51 (quoting
Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co. v. O'Connor, 223 U. S. 280, 285(1912)), the States may determine whether to provide predeprivation process (e. g., an injunction) or instead to affordpostdeprivation relief (

e. g., a refund), 496 U. S., at 36-37.See also Harper v. Virginia Dept. of Taxation, 509 U. S. 86,

100-102 (1993). Of particular relevance to this case, FairAssessment in Real Estate Assn., Inc. v. McNary, 454 U. S.
100, 116 (1981), held that because of principles of comity andfederalism, Congress never authorized federal courts to entertain damages actions under $ 1983 against state taxeswhen state law furnishes an adequate legal remedy.

Seeking to overcome the longstanding federal reluctanceto interfere with state taxation, petitioners invoke the Supremacy Clause and the straightforward proposition that itrequires state courts to enforce federal law, here $$ 1983 and
1988. When they have jurisdiction, state courts have beencompelled to provide federal remedies, notwithstanding the
existence of less intrusive state-law remedies. See, e. g.,Monroe v. Pape, 365 U. S. 167, 183 (1961). Accordingly, petitioners argue that we should require the Oklahoma SupremeCourt to award equitable and declaratory relief under $ 1983
and attorney's fees under $ 1988.For purposes of this case, we will assume without deciding
that state courts generally must hear $ 1983 suits.4 But this

4 We have never held that state courts must entertain $ 1983 suits. See

Opinion of the Court

does not necessarily mean that, having found a violation of
federal law, state courts must award declaratory and injunctive relief under $ 1983 in tax cases. Though federal courts
are obliged to hear $ 1983 claims, it is clear that they may
not award damages or declaratory or injunctive relief in
state tax cases when an adequate state remedy exists. See
Fair Assessment, supra, at 116; Great Lakes Dredge & Dock
Co. v. Huffman, supra, at 293; Matthews v. Rodgers, 284 U. S.
521, 525 (1932); 28 U. S. C. $ 1341.

As we explain more fully below, the background presumption that federal law generally will not interfere with administration of state taxes leads us to conclude that Congress
did not authorize injunctive or declaratory relief under $ 1983
in state tax cases when there is an adequate remedy at law.5

III
Petitioners correctly point out that the Tax Injunction Act
does not prohibit state courts from entertaining $ 1983 suits
that seek to enjoin the collection of state taxes. Nor can a
desire for "intrastate uniformity" permit state courts to refuse to award relief merely because a federal court could not
grant such relief. As petitioners note, it was not until 1875
that Congress provided any kind of general federal-question
jurisdiction to the lower federal courts. See Palmore v.
United States, 411 U. S. 389, 401 (1973). "Until that time,
the state courts provided the only forum for vindicating
many important federal claims." Ibid. Because of the Supremacy Clause, state courts could not have refused to hear
cases arising under federal law merely to ensure "uniform$ 1983"). Cf. Arkansas Writers' Project, Inc. v. Ragland, 481 U. S. 221,
234, n. 7 (1987) (observing that whether state courts must assume jurisdiction over $ 1983 claims involving state taxes "is not entirely clear").

5 Will v. Michigan Dept. of State Police, 491 U. S. 58, 68-69 (1989),

already established that petitioners' claim for refunds against the State
could not proceed under $ 1983.

Opinion of the Court
ity" between state and federal courts located within a partic-ular state.

In determining whether Congress has authorized statecourts to issue injunctive and declaratory relief in state tax
cases, we must interpret $ 1983 in light of the strong background principle against federal interference with state tax-ation. Given this principle, we hold that $ 1983 does not call

for either federal or state courts to award injunctive anddeclaratory relief in state tax cases when an adequate legal
remedy exists. Petitioners do not dispute that Oklahomahas offered an adequate remedy in the form of refunds.
Under these circumstances, the Oklahoma courts' denial of
relief under $ 1983 was consistent with the long line of precedent underscoring the federal reluctance to interfere with
state taxation.

Our cases since Dows have uniformly concluded that federal courts cannot enjoin the collection of state taxes when a
remedy at law is available. See, e. g., Matthews v. Rodgers,
supra, at 525 (a "scrupulous regard for the rightful independence of state governments . . . and a proper reluctance to
interfere by injunction with their fiscal operations, require
that [injunctive] relief should be denied in every case where
the asserted federal right may be preserved without it");
Singer Sewing Machine Co. of N. J. v. Benedict, 229 U. S. 481,
485 (1913); Boise Artesian Hot & Cold Water Co. v. Boise
City, 213 U. S. 276, 282 (1909). Until Fair Assessment, one
could have construed these cases as concerning only the
equitable powers of the federal courts. See 454 U. S., at
108-111. In Fair Assessment, however, the principle of
noninterference with state taxation led us to construe $ 1983
narrowly. We held that $ 1983 does not permit federal
courts to award damages in state tax cases when state law
provides an adequate remedy. See id., at 116. Although
there was much discussion of the limitations on equity
power, that discussion was useful only insofar as it provided
a background against which $ 1983 must be interpreted. In515us2$84n 08-17-98 13:11:29 PAGES OPINPGT
590 NATIONAL PRIVATE TRUCK COUNCIL, INC. v.

OKLAHOMA TAX COMM'N

Opinion of the Court

deed, because Fair Assessment considered whether damageswere available under $ 1983, the principle of equitable restraint that we discussed could have no direct application inthat case.

In concluding that Congress did not authorize damages actions in state tax cases brought in federal court, we foundno evidence that Congress intended $ 1983 to overturn the

principle of federalism invoked in Dows and subsequentlyfollowed by the courts. Construing $ 1983, we held that the
case was "controlled by principles articulated even beforeenactment of $ 1983 and followed in later decisions."

Id.,
at 115-116.Just as

Fair Assessment relied upon a background principle in interpreting $ 1983 to preclude damages actions in tax
cases brought in federal court, so we rely on the same princi-ple in interpreting $ 1983 to provide no basis for courts to

award injunctive relief when an adequate legal remedy ex-ists. Our interpretation is supported not only by the background principle of federal noninterference discussed in Fair
Assessment, but also by the principles of equitable restraint
discussed at length in that case. See id., at 107-109.Whether a suit is brought in federal or state court, Congress

simply did not authorize the disruption of state tax administration in this way.

To be sure, the Tax Injunction Act reflects the congressional concern with federal court interference with state taxation, see 28 U. S. C. $ 1341, and there is no similar statute
divesting state courts of the authority to enter an injunction
under federal law when an adequate legal remedy exists.
But this silence is irrelevant here, because we do not understand $ 1983 to call for courts (whether federal or state) to
enjoin the collection of state taxes when an adequate remedy
is available under state law. Given the strong background
presumption against interference with state taxation, the
Tax Injunction Act may be best understood as but a partial
codification of the federal reluctance to interfere with state
taxation. See Fair Assessment, supra, at 110 ("[T]he prin515us2$84n 08-17-98 13:11:29 PAGES OPINPGT

591Cite as: 515 U. S. 582 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
ciple of comity which predated the Act [$ 1341] was not restricted by its passage"). After all, an injunction issued by
a state court pursuant to $ 1983 is just as disruptive as one
entered by a federal court.

The availability of an adequate legal remedy renders a
declaratory judgment unwarranted as well. In Great Lakes,
we observed that "considerations which have led federal
courts of equity to refuse to enjoin the collection of state
taxes . . . require a like restraint in the use of the declaratory
judgment procedure." 319 U. S., at 299. The declaratory
judgment procedure "may in every practical sense operate
to suspend collection of the state taxes until the litigation
is ended," ibid., and thus must be treated as being no less
potentially disruptive than an injunction. See also Grace
Brethren Church, 457 U. S., at 408 ("[T]here is little practical
difference between injunctive and declaratory relief "). Cf.
Samuels v. Mackell, 401 U. S. 66 (1971) (holding that prohibition against enjoining pending state criminal proceedings applies to granting of declaratory relief). Declaratory relief in
state tax cases might throw tax administration "into disarray, and taxpayers might escape the ordinary procedural requirements imposed by state law." Perez v. Ledesma, 401
U. S. 82, 128, n. 17 (1971) (Brennan, J., concurring in part and
dissenting in part). We simply do not read $ 1983 to provide
for injunctive or declaratory relief against a state tax, either
in federal or state court, when an adequate legal remedy
exists.6

6 As our opinions reveal, there may be extraordinary circumstances
under which injunctive or declaratory relief is available even when a legal
remedy exists. For example, if the "enforcement of the tax would lead to
a multiplicity of suits, or produce irreparable injury, [or] throw a cloud
upon the title," equity might be invoked. Dows v. Chicago, 11 Wall. 108,
110 (1871). As we have made clear, however, the multiplicity-of-suits
rationale for permitting equitable relief extends only to those situations
where there is a real risk of "numerous suits between the same parties,
involving the same issues of law or fact." Matthews v. Rodgers, 284 U. S.
521, 530 (1932). Thus, if a state court awards a refund to a taxpayer on

Kennedy, J., concurring

Of course, nothing we say prevents a State from empower-ing its own courts to issue injunctions and declaratory judgments even when a legal remedy exists. Absent a valid fed-eral prohibition, state courts are free to issue injunctions
and declaratory judgments under state law. When a litigantseeks declaratory or injunctive relief against a state tax pursuant to $ 1983, however, state courts, like their federal coun-terparts, must refrain from granting federal relief under

$ 1983 when there is an adequate legal remedy.Because petitioners had an adequate legal remedy, the
Oklahoma courts could not have awarded either declaratoryor injunctive relief against the state taxes under $ 1983. It
follows that when no relief can be awarded pursuant to$ 1983, no attorney's fees can be awarded under $ 1988. Accordingly, the judgment of the Oklahoma Supreme Court is

Affirmed.
Justice Kennedy, concurring.
One reason for difficulty in adapting 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 toan action attacking a state tax is, in my view, that $ 1983 was

not intended for claims based on the Commerce Clause at all.See Dennis v. Higgins, 498 U. S. 439, 451 (1991) (

Kennedy,
J., dissenting) (violations of the Commerce Clause do not giverise to a cause of action under $ 1983); see also

Golden StateTransit Corp. v. Los Angeles, 493 U. S. 103, 117 (1989) (

Kennedy, J., dissenting) (a federal statute's pre-emptive effectdoes not secure a right within the meaning of $ 1983). The

Court has not adopted that position, however, and on thatpremise I agree with today's opinion and join it in full.

the ground that the tax violates the Federal Constitution, but state tax
authorities continue to impose the unconstitutional tax, injunctive and declaratory relief might then be appropriate. In such circumstances, the
remedy might be thought to be "inadequate."

Syllabus

UNITED STATES v. AGUILAR
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 94-270. Argued March 20, 1995--Decided June 21, 1995
Respondent Aguilar, a United States District Judge, was convicted of illegally disclosing a wiretap in violation of 18 U. S. C. $ 2232(c), even
though the authorization for the particular wiretap had expired before
the disclosure was made. Because he lied to Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents during a grand jury investigation, he also was convicted of endeavoring to obstruct the due administration of justice
under $ 1503. The Court of Appeals reversed both convictions, reasoning that Aguilar's conduct in each instance was not covered by the statutory language.

Held:

1. Uttering false statements to an investigating agent who might or
might not testify before a grand jury is not sufficient to make out a
violation of $ 1503's prohibition of "endeavor[ing] to influence, obstruct,
or impede . . . the due administration of justice." The "nexus" requirement developed in recent Courts of Appeals decisions--whereby the
accused's act must have a relationship in time, causation, or logic with
grand jury or judicial proceedings--is a correct construction of $ 1503's
very broad language. Under that approach, the accused must take action with an intent to influence such proceedings; it is not enough that
there be an intent to influence some ancillary proceeding, such as an
investigation independent of the court's or grand jury's authority.
Moreover, the endeavor must have the "natural and probable effect" of
interfering with the due administration of justice, see, e. g., United
States v. Wood, 6 F. 3d 692, 695, and a person lacking knowledge that
his actions are likely to affect a pending proceeding necessarily lacks
the requisite intent to obstruct, Pettibone v. United States, 148 U. S.
197, 206-207. The Government did not show here that the FBI agents
acted as an arm of the grand jury, that the grand jury had subpoenaed
their testimony or otherwise directed them to appear, or that respondent knew that his false statements would be provided to the grand jury.
Indeed, the evidence goes no further than showing that respondent testified falsely to an investigating agent. What use will be made of such
testimony is so speculative that the testimony cannot be said to have
the "natural and probable effect" of obstructing justice. Pp. 598-602.

2. Disclosure of a wiretap after its authorization expires violates

$ 2232(c), which provides criminal penalties for anyone who, "[1] having
knowledge that a Federal . . . officer has been authorized or has applied
for authorization . . . to intercept a wire . . . communication, [2] in order
to obstruct, impede, or prevent such interception, [3] gives notice or
attempts to give notice of the possible interception to any person."
Contrary to the Court of Appeals' holding, the statutory language does
not require that the wiretap application or authorization be pending or
in esse at the time of the disclosure. Such a narrow purpose is not
evidenced by the term "such interception" in the statute's second clause,
which merely establishes that the defendant must intend to obstruct the
interception made pursuant to the application or authorization of which
he has the knowledge required by the first clause. Similarly, the phrase
"possible interception" in the third clause was not designed to limit the
punishable offense to cases where the interception was factually "possible," but was intended to recognize the fact that at the time the prohibited notice was given it very likely could not be known whether or not
there would be an interception. Moreover, without the word "possible," the statute would only prohibit giving notice of "the interception":
It would not reach the giving of notice of an application which has not
yet resulted in an authorization or an authorization which has not yet
resulted in an interception. Finally, the statute need not be read to
exclude disclosures of expired wiretaps because of concern that a
broader construction would run counter to the First Amendment. The
Government's interest in nondisclosure by officials in sensitive confidential positions is quite sufficient to justify the construction of the statute
as written, without any artificial narrowing because of First Amendment concerns. Pp. 602-606.

Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of theCourt.
A jury convicted United States District Judge RobertAguilar of one count of illegally disclosing a wiretap in violation of 18 U. S. C. $ 2232(c), and of one count of endeavoringto obstruct the due administration of justice in violation of

$ 1503. A panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Cir-cuit affirmed the conviction under $ 2232(c) but reversed the
conviction under $ 1503. After rehearing en banc, the Courtof Appeals reversed both convictions. We granted certiorari to resolve a conflict among the Federal Circuits overwhether $ 1503 punishes false statements made to potential
grand jury witnesses, and to answer the important questionwhether disclosure of a wiretap after its authorization expires violates $ 2232(c). 513 U. S. 1013 (1994).Many facts remain disputed by the parties. Both parties
appear to agree, however, that a motion for postconvictionrelief filed by one Michael Rudy Tham represents the starting point from which events bearing on this case unfolded.Tham was an officer of the International Brotherhood of
Teamsters, and was convicted of embezzling funds from thelocal affiliate of that organization. In July 1987, he filed a
motion under 28 U. S. C. $ 2255 to have his conviction setaside. The motion was assigned to Judge Stanley Weigel.
Tham, seeking to enhance the odds that his petition would begranted, asked Edward Solomon and Abraham Chalupowitz,
a.k.a. Abe Chapman, to assist him by capitalizing on theirrespective acquaintances with another judge in the Northern
District of California, respondent Aguilar. Respondentknew Chapman as a distant relation by marriage and knew
Solomon from law school. Solomon and Chapman met with

Opinion of the Court
respondent to discuss Tham's case, as a result of which respondent spoke with Judge Weigel about the matter.

Independent of the embezzlement conviction, the Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) identified Tham as a suspect
in an investigation of labor racketeering. On April 20, 1987,
the FBI applied for authorization to install a wiretap on
Tham's business phones. Chapman appeared on the application as a potential interceptee. Chief District Judge Robert
Peckham authorized the wiretap. The 30-day wiretap expired by law on May 20, 1987, 18 U. S. C. $ 2518(5), but Chief
Judge Peckham maintained the secrecy of the wiretap under

$ 2518(8)(d) after a showing of good cause. During the
course of the racketeering investigation, the FBI learned of
the meetings between Chapman and respondent. The FBI
informed Chief Judge Peckham, who, concerned with appearances of impropriety, advised respondent in August 1987
that Chapman might be connected with criminal elements
because Chapman's name had appeared on a wiretap
authorization.

Five months after respondent learned that Chapman had
been named in a wiretap authorization, he noticed a man
observing his home during a visit by Chapman. He alerted
his nephew to this fact and conveyed the message (with an
intent that his nephew relay the information to Chapman)
that Chapman's phone was being wiretapped. Respondent
apparently believed, in error, both that Chapman's phones
were tapped in connection with the initial application and
that the initial authorization was still in effect. Chief Judge
Peckham had in fact authorized another wiretap on Tham's
phones effective from October 1987 through the period in
which respondent made the disclosure, but there is no suggestion in the record that the latter had any specific knowledge of this reauthorization.

At this point, respondent's involvement in the two separate Tham matters converged. Two months after the disclo515us2$85h 08-25-98 19:27:51 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
sure to his nephew, a grand jury began to investigate an
alleged conspiracy to influence the outcome of Tham's habeas
case. Two FBI agents questioned respondent. During the
interview, respondent lied about his participation in the
Tham case and his knowledge of the wiretap. The grand
jury returned an indictment; a jury convicted Aguilar of one
count of disclosing a wiretap, 18 U. S. C. $ 2232(c), and one
count of endeavoring to obstruct the due administration of
justice, $ 1503. A panel of the Court of Appeals for the
Ninth Circuit affirmed the $ 2232(c) conviction but reversed
the $ 1503 conviction.

On rehearing en banc, the Court of Appeals reversed both
convictions for the reason that the conduct in each instance
was not covered by the statutory language. 21 F. 3d 1475
(1994). The court concluded that $ 2232(c) requires the disclosure of a pending wiretap application or an authorization
that had not expired because the purpose of the statute was
to thwart interference with the " `possible interception' " of
the wiretap of which the defendant had knowledge. Id., at
1480. Finding the interception in this case impossible once
the authorization had expired, it held respondent's disclosure
was not covered by the plain language of the statute. The
Court of Appeals also found that respondent had not interfered with a pending judicial proceeding under $ 1503. It
first noted that the grand jury had not authorized or directed
the FBI investigation. It then held that merely uttering
false statements does not " `corruptly influence' " within the
meaning of the statute. Id., at 1485-1486. It drew this
conclusion, in part, from 1988 amendments to $ 1512, which
added a prohibition on corrupt persuasion of witnesses.
The court read the corrupt persuasion prohibited by $ 1512
to require an active attempt to persuade a witness to tell a
false story, and used the language in $ 1512 as a guide to
interpret the omnibus clause of $ 1503 narrowly.

Opinion of the Court

I
Section 1503 provides:

"Whoever corruptly, or by threats or force, or by anythreatening letter or communication, endeavors to influence, intimidate, or impede any grand or petit juror,or officer in or of any court of the United States, or officer who may be serving at any examination or otherproceeding before any United States commissioner or
other committing magistrate, in the discharge of hisduty, or injures any such grand or petit juror in his person or property on account of any verdict or indictmentassented to by him, or on account of his being or having
been such juror, or injures any such officer, commis-sioner, or other committing magistrate in his person or
property on account of the performance of his officialduties, or

corruptly or by threats or force, or by anythreatening letter or communication, influences, obstructs, or impedes, or endeavors to influence, obstruct,
or impede, the due administration of justice, shall befined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more

than five years, or both." 18 U. S. C. $ 1503 (emphasisadded).

The statute is structured as follows: first it proscribes per-sons from endeavoring to influence, intimidate, or impede
grand or petit jurors or court officers in the discharge oftheir duties; it then prohibits injuring grand or petit jurors
in their person or property because of any verdict or indict-ment rendered by them; it then prohibits injury of any court
officer, commissioner, or similar officer on account of the per-formance of his official duties; finally, the "Omnibus Clause"
serves as a catchall, prohibiting persons from endeavoring toinfluence, obstruct, or impede the due administration of justice. The latter clause, it can be seen, is far more general inscope than the earlier clauses of the statute. Respondent

was charged with a violation of the Omnibus Clause, to wit:
with "corruptly endeavor[ing] to influence, obstruct, and impede the . . . grand jury investigation." App. 106.

The first case from this Court construing the predecessor
statute to $ 1503 was Pettibone v. United States, 148 U. S.
197 (1893). There we held that "a person is not sufficiently
charged with obstructing or impeding the due administration
of justice in a court unless it appears that he knew or had
notice that justice was being administered in such court."
Id., at 206. The Court reasoned that a person lacking
knowledge of a pending proceeding necessarily lacked the
evil intent to obstruct. Id., at 207. Recent decisions of
Courts of Appeals have likewise tended to place metes and
bounds on the very broad language of the catchall provision.
The action taken by the accused must be with an intent to
influence judicial or grand jury proceedings; it is not enough
that there be an intent to influence some ancillary proceeding, such as an investigation independent of the court's or
grand jury's authority. United States v. Brown, 688 F. 2d
596, 598 (CA9 1982) (citing cases). Some courts have
phrased this showing as a "nexus" requirement--that the act
must have a relationship in time, causation, or logic with the
judicial proceedings. United States v. Wood, 6 F. 3d 692, 696
(CA10 1993); United States v. Walasek, 527 F. 2d 676, 679,
and n. 12 (CA3 1975). In other words, the endeavor must
have the " `natural and probable effect' " of interfering with
the due administration of justice. Wood, supra, at 695;
United States v. Thomas, 916 F. 2d 647, 651 (CA11 1990);
Walasek, supra, at 679. This is not to say that the defendant's actions need be successful; an "endeavor" suffices.
United States v. Russell, 255 U. S. 138, 143 (1921). But as
in Pettibone, if the defendant lacks knowledge that his actions are likely to affect the judicial proceeding, he lacks the
requisite intent to obstruct.

Opinion of the Court
Although respondent urges various broader grounds foraffirmance,

we think the "nexus" requirement developed in the decisionsof the Courts of Appeals is a correct construction of $ 1503.

We have traditionally exercised restraint in assessing thereach of a federal criminal statute, both out of deference to
the prerogatives of Congress, Dowling v. United States, 473U. S. 207 (1985), and out of concern that "a fair warning
should be given to the world in language that the commonworld will understand, of what the law intends to do if a
certain line is passed," McBoyle v. United States, 283 U. S.25, 27 (1931). We do not believe that uttering false statements to an investigating agent--and that seems to be allthat was proved here--who might or might not testify before
a grand jury is sufficient to make out a violation of the catch-all provision of $ 1503.

The Government did not show here that the agents actedas an arm of the grand jury, or indeed that the grand jury
had even summoned the testimony of these particular agents.The Government argues that respondent "understood that
his false statements would be provided to the grand jury"and that he made the statements with the intent to thwart
the grand jury investigation and not just the FBI investiga-tion. Brief for United States 18. The Government supports its argument with a citation to the transcript of therecorded conversation between Aguilar and the FBI agent
at the point where Aguilar asks whether he is a target of agrand jury investigation. The agent responded to the question by stating:

"[T]here is a Grand Jury meeting. Convening I guessthat's the correct word. Um some evidence will be

heard I'm . . . I'm sure on this issue." App. 86.
1 Respondent argues that the term "corruptly" is vague and overbroad
as applied to the type of conduct at issue in this case and that Congress
narrowed the scope of the Omnibus Clause when it expressly punished his
conduct in 18 U. S. C. $ 1512.

Opinion of the Court
Because respondent knew of the pending proceeding, theGovernment therefore contends that Aguilar's statements

are analogous to those made directly to the grand jury itself,in the form of false testimony or false documents.

We think the transcript citation relied upon by the Gov-ernment would not enable a rational trier of fact to conclude

that respondent knew that his false statement would be pro-vided to the grand jury, and that the evidence goes no further than showing that respondent testified falsely to an in-vestigating agent. Such conduct, we believe, falls on the
other side of the statutory line from that of one who deliversfalse documents or testimony to the grand jury itself. Conduct of the latter sort all but assures that the grand jury willconsider the material in its deliberations. But what use will
be made of false testimony given to an investigating agentwho has not been subpoenaed or otherwise directed to appear before the grand jury is far more speculative. Wethink it cannot be said to have the "natural and probable
effect" of interfering with the due administration of justice.

Justice Scalia criticizes our treatment of the statutorylanguage for reading the word "endeavor" out of it, inasmuch

as it excludes defendants who have an evil purpose but usemeans that would "only unnaturally and improbably be successful." Post, at 612. This criticism is unwarranted. Ourreading of the statute gives the term "endeavor" a useful
function to fulfill: It makes conduct punishable where thedefendant acts with an intent to obstruct justice, and in a
manner that is likely to obstruct justice, but is foiled in some

way. Were a defendant with the requisite intent to lie to asubpoenaed witness who is ultimately not called to testify,

or who testifies but does not transmit the defendant's versionof the story, the defendant has endeavored to obstruct, but
has not actually obstructed, justice. Under our approach, ajury could find such defendant guilty.

Justice Scalia also apparently believes that any act,done with the intent to "obstruct . . . the due administration
of justice," is sufficient to impose criminal liability. Underthe dissent's theory, a man could be found guilty under $ 1503
if he knew of a pending investigation and lied to his wifeabout his whereabouts at the time of the crime, thinking that
an FBI agent might decide to interview her and that shemight in turn be influenced in her statement to the agent by
her husband's false account of his whereabouts. The intentto obstruct justice is indeed present, but the man's culpability is a good deal less clear from the statute than we usuallyrequire in order to impose criminal liability.

II
Section 2232(c) prohibits the disclosure of information thata wiretap has been sought or authorized. The statute reads:

"Whoever, having knowledge that a Federal investiga-tive or law enforcement officer has been authorized or
has applied for authorization under chapter 119 to inter-cept a wire, oral, or electronic communication, in order
to obstruct, impede, or prevent such interception, givesnotice or attempts to give notice of the possible interception to any person shall be fined under this title orimprisoned not more than five years, or both." 18
U. S. C. $ 2232(c).
This section is much more precisely targeted than is thecatchall provision of $ 1503 discussed above. The first clause

defines the element of knowledge required for the act to becriminal: knowledge that an officer has been authorized or

Opinion of the Court
has sought authorization to intercept a communication. Thesecond clause defines the required intent with which the act

be done: "in order to obstruct, impede, or prevent such inter-ception." The third clause defines the punishable act: "gives
notice or attempts to give notice of the possible interception." Respondent persuaded the Court of Appeals to holdthat the wiretap application or authorization must be pending or in esse at the time of the disclosure, but we do notbelieve any such requirement is to be found in the statutory language.Respondent here urges the reasoning accepted by the
Court of Appeals. "[T]he purpose of the statute is to prevent interference with `possible interception.' " 21 F. 3d, at
1480. Once a wiretap has expired or been denied, the Ninth
Circuit reasoned, there is no " `possible interception' " to
disclose or attempt to disclose. Ibid. The narrow purpose
of the statute is further evidenced by the statute's intent
requirement, which limits punishable disclosures to those
undertaken with the intent to interfere with " `such interception' " of which the defendant "has knowledge." Ibid.
Under the circumstances, the disclosure of an expired wiretap not only fails to violate the terms of the statute, it fails
to implicate any interest protected by $ 2232(c). Brief for
Respondent 38.

But this argument, we think, fails in the face of the statutory language itself. The term "such interception" is part
of the intent requirement in the second clause; the defendant
must intend to obstruct the interception made pursuant to
the application or authorization of which he has the knowledge required by the first clause. The phrase "possible interception" is found in the third clause, which describes the
act which offends the statute. A defendant intending to disclose the existence of a pending application would ordinarily
have no way of knowing whether the application or authorization had resulted in an interception, and that is doubtless
why the third clause uses the term "possible" interception.

604 UNITED STATES v. AGUILAR

Opinion of the Court
It was not intended to limit the offense to cases where theinterception based upon the application or authorization was

factually possible, but to recognize the fact that at the timethe prohibited notice was given it very likely could not be
known whether or not there would be an interception.The Court of Appeals thought its result justified by its
view that the aim of the statute was to prevent interferencewith "possible" interceptions, and that if an interception was
not possible because the wiretap was no longer in place atthe time of the disclosure, that interest was not threatened.
But the statute is aimed at something more than the inter-ference with interceptions; it is aimed at disclosure of wiretap orders or applications which may lead to interceptions.The offense is complete at the time the notice is given, when
it often cannot be known whether any interception willtake place.

Justice Stevens argues that $ 2232(c) criminalizes disclo-sures of pending applications without a need to rely on the
word " `possible.' " Post, at 608. That is not so. The refer-ence to pending applications occurs only in the clause specifying the knowledge element. The actus reus element mustbe independently satisfied. Without the word "possible,"
the statute would only prohibit giving notice of "the inter-ception": It would not reach the giving of notice of an application which has not yet resulted in an authorization or anauthorization which has not yet resulted in an interception.
That Congress could have accomplished the same result byphrasing the statute differently--for instance, by repeating
" `such interception' " in the third clause, ibid.--does notundercut the fact that the word "possible" is necessary in the
statute as written to criminalize such behavior.3

3 Justice Stevens also argues that our reading of the statute would
achieve no temporal limitation on liability and could result in the "absurd"
prosecution of a discloser 10 years after the wiretap expired. Post, at
608-609. Although we reserve the question for a case that presents it,
we note that the wiretapping scheme as a whole suggests that a plausible

605Cite as: 515 U. S. 593 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
Acceptance of respondent's position would open the doorto additional claims of "impossibility" other than the fact that

the application or order was not pending at the time of thedisclosure. Some sort of mechanical failure, or the departure of the person whose conversation was to be interceptedfrom the place at which the reception was authorized, are
two which come to mind. In Osborn v. United States, 385U. S. 323, 333 (1966), we expressed reservations about the
"continuing validity [of] the doctrine of `impossibility,' withall its subtleties," in the law of criminal attempt, and we
would require much more than the statutory language beforeus to believe that Congress intended to engraft it onto the
language of $ 2232(c).Finally, respondent urges us to read the statute to exclude
disclosures of expired wiretaps because of concern that abroader construction would run counter to the First Amendment. We see no necessity for such a restrictive construc-tion of the statute. It is true that the Government may not
generally restrict individuals from disclosing informationthat lawfully comes into their hands in the absence of a
"state interest of the highest order." Smith v. Daily Mail
Publishing Co., 443 U. S. 97, 103 (1979). But the statutehere in question does not impose such a restriction generally,

but only upon those who disclose wiretap information "inorder to obstruct, impede, or prevent" the interception.
Nor was the respondent simply a member of the general
temporal limit on liability for disclosure would be the point at which the
authorizing judge notifies the interceptee and related parties of the existence of an application or authorization pursuant to 18 U. S. C. $ 2518(8)(d).
Such notification must occur "within a reasonable time" after denial of the
application or termination of a wiretap, and may be postponed only upon
a showing of "good cause." $ 2518(8)(d). The parties did not brief this
issue, and we need not decide it on these facts because respondent disclosed his knowledge of the wiretap application before Chief Judge Peckham notified the parties in May 1989. That notification issued two years
after the FBI first applied for authorization and one year after the last
authorized wiretap expired.

public who happened to lawfully acquire possession of infor-mation about the wiretap; he was a Federal District Court

Judge who learned of a confidential wiretap application fromthe judge who had authorized the interception, and who
wished to preserve the integrity of the court. Government
officials in sensitive confidential positions may have specialduties of nondisclosure. See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 6(e) (prohibiting the disclosure of grand jury information). Like-wise, protective orders may be imposed in connection with
information acquired through civil discovery without violat-ing the First Amendment.

Seattle Times Co. v. Rhinehart,
467 U. S. 20, 31 (1984). As to one who voluntarily assumeda duty of confidentiality, governmental restrictions on disclosure are not subject to the same stringent standards that
would apply to efforts to impose restrictions on unwillingmembers of the public. See

Snepp v. United States, 444
U. S. 507 (1980) (per curiam). In this case, Chief Judge
Peckham postponed the notification of parties named in the
application in order to maintain the secrecy of the wiretap.
See 18 U. S. C. $ 2518(1)(d). We think the Government's
interest is quite sufficient to justify the construction of the
statute as written, without any artificial narrowing because
of First Amendment concerns.

Respondent raised below a challenge to the jury instructions, but the Court of Appeals found it unnecessary to decide. We affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals with
respect to respondent's conviction under $ 1503 and reverse
with respect to respondent's conviction under $ 2232(c). We
remand for proceedings consistent with this decision.

So ordered.
Justice Stevens, concurring in part and dissenting in
part.

Although I agree with the Court's disposition of the 18
U. S. C. $ 1503 issue, and also with its rejection of the First

Amendment challenge to respondent's conviction for disclos-ing a wiretap application under $ 2232(c), I believe the Court

of Appeals correctly construed $ 2232(c) to invalidate re-spondent's conviction under that statute.

When respondent was convicted of disclosing a 30-day
wiretap authorization that had expired months before thedisclosure, he was convicted of an attempt to do the impossible: interfere with a nonexistent wiretap. Traditionally, thelaw does not proscribe an attempt unless the defendant's intent is accompanied by "a dangerous probability that [theunlawful result] will happen."

Swift & Co. v. United States,
196 U. S. 375, 396 (1905) (Holmes, J.). Whether such a dangerous probability exists, of course, depends ultimately on
what result we interpret the statute as having declared unlawful. See 2 W. LaFave & A. Scott, Substantive Criminal
Law $ 6.3, pp. 44-45 (1986). In this case, there was no dangerous probability that respondent actually would reveal the
existence of a wiretap or wiretap application because none
existed to reveal. We should abjure a construction of a
criminal statute that leads to criminalizing nothing more
than an evil intent accompanied by a harmless act, particularly when, as here, the statutory language does not clearly
extend liability so far. Cf. Simpson v. United States, 435
U. S. 6, 14-15 (1978).

Indeed, the text of $ 2232(c) favors a reading that requires,
as an essential element of the offense, the possibility of interference with an authorized interception. Both the second
and third clauses of the statute support this straightforward
interpretation. The second clause requires that the defendant intend to impede "such interception." That phrase refers to an interception that the defendant knows a federal
officer "has been authorized or has applied for authorization"
to make. After the authorization expires, no "such interception" can occur. Moreover, to infer that "such interception"
includes any interception that might be made pursuant to
any subsequent reauthorization severely undermines the

Opinion of Stevens, J.
statute's knowledge requirement by making actual knowl-edge of an initial, limited authorization the linchpin of liability for disclosing later, entirely conjectural or nonexistentauthorizations. That inference contradicts our usual practice of giving strict effect to scienter provisions. See, e. g.,
United States v. X-Citement Video, Inc., 513 U. S. 64, 68-71(1994).

The third clause of $ 2232(c) describes the notice that adefendant must attempt to give a third person in order to
violate the statute as notice of "the possible interception."The definite article necessarily refers to an interception that
is "authorized" (or for which federal officers have applied for
authorization) per the second clause, thereby imposing authorization as a requirement to satisfy the next word, "possible." I agree with the Court that interceptions prevented
by mechanical failures or the departure of the suspect are
"possible" within the meaning of the statute, see ante, at
603-604, as long as those interceptions, however unlikely, are
legally "authorized." The wholly theoretical interception
that respondent was convicted of attempting to impede was
not authorized, nor had federal officers even sought authorization for it; therefore, it was not "possible" within the meaning of the statute.

The Court's attempt to explain the word "possible" as an
assurance that the statute will cover interceptions that may
or may not result from a pending application, see ante, at
604, is unpersuasive. Because the statute plainly criminalizes disclosures of pending applications, "possible" does not
need to do the work the Court assigns it. The phrase "such
interception," already used in the second clause, would do
just as well. The function of "possible" must be to place
some temporal limitation on potential liability under the
statute. Under the Court's reasoning, respondent could be
found guilty if he had disclosed a 10-year-old application or
authorization. The word "possible," properly understood,
would prevent such an absurd result by limiting liability to

Opinion of Scalia, J.
interceptions that could actually be made pursuant to pres-ent or pending authorization.

As the Court notes in response to this opinion, see ibid.,under its reading the third clause serves to define the actus
reus element of the crime, just as Congress could have doneby replacing the phrase "notice of the possible interception"
with the unambiguous phrase "notice of such authorizationor application." That unambiguous language, however,
would not achieve the temporal limitation on liability that Ibelieve Congress intended to achieve with the words "possible interception." The Court appears to acknowledge theneed for such a limitation. See

ante, at 604-605, n. 3.Rather than recognizing the limitation the statute contains,

however, the Court hints that it might in some future caseinvent one. Limiting liability to the time before the authorizing judge announces the wiretap may well be "plausible,"
ibid., but no plausible basis exists for finding that limitationin the words of the statute. A wiser course than judicial

legislation, I submit, is simply to adopt a literal, reasonableconstruction of the text that Congress drafted.

I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals in itsentirety.

Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Kennedy and
Justice Thomas join, concurring in part and dissentingin part.

I join all but Part I and the last paragraph of Part II ofthe Court's opinion. I would reverse the Court of Appeals,
and would uphold respondent's conviction, on the countcharging violation of 18 U. S. C. $ 1503.

I
The "omnibus clause" of $ 1503, under which respondentwas charged, provides:

"Whoever . . . corruptly or by threats or force, or byany threatening letter or communication, influences, ob515us2$85k 08-25-98 19:27:51 PAGES OPINPGT

structs, or impedes, or endeavors to influence, obstruct,or impede, the due administration of justice, shall be

fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more thanfive years, or both."

This makes criminal not just success in corruptly influencingthe due administration of justice, but also the "endeavor" to
do so. We have given this latter proscription, which re-spondent was specifically charged with violating, see App.
106-107, a generous reading: "The word of the section is `en-deavor,' and by using it the section got rid of the technicalities which might be urged as besetting the word `attempt,'and it describes

any effort or essay to accomplish the evilpurpose that the section was enacted to prevent." United

States v. Russell, 255 U. S. 138, 143 (1921) (emphasis added)(interpreting substantially identical predecessor statute).
Under this reading of the statute, it is even immaterialwhether the endeavor to obstruct pending proceedings is
possible of accomplishment. In Osborn v. United States, 385U. S. 323, 333 (1966), we dismissed out of hand the "impossibility" defense of a defendant who had sought to convey abribe to a prospective juror through an intermediary who
was secretly working for the Government. "Whatever con-tinuing validity," we said, "the doctrine of `impossibility' . . .
may continue to have in the law of criminal attempt, thatbody of law is inapplicable here." Ibid. (footnote omitted).

1

Even read at its broadest, however, $ 1503's prohibition of"endeavors" to impede justice is not without limits. To "endeavor" means to strive or work for a certain end. Web-ster's New International Dictionary 844 (2d ed. 1950); 1 New

1 This complete disavowal of the impossibility defense may be excessive.
As Pettibone v. United States, 148 U. S. 197 (1893), acknowledged, an endeavor to obstruct proceedings that did not exist would not violate the
statute. "[O]bstruction can only arise when justice is being administered." Id., at 207. See, e. g., United States v. Williams, 874 F. 2d 968,
977 (CA5 1989) ("There are three core elements that the government must
establish . . . : (1) there must be a pending judicial proceeding").

Shorter Oxford English Dictionary 816 (1993). Thus, $ 1503reaches only purposeful efforts to obstruct the due administration of justice, i. e., acts performed with that very objectin mind. See, e. g., United States v. Mullins, 22 F. 3d 1365,
1370 (CA6 1994); United States v. Ryan, 455 F. 2d 728, 734(CA9 1972). This limitation was clearly set forth in our first
decision construing $ 1503's predecessor statute, Pettibone v.
United States, 148 U. S. 197 (1893), which held an indictmentinsufficient because it had failed to allege the intent to obstruct justice. That opinion rejected the Government's con-tention that the intent required to violate the statute could
be found in "the intent to commit an unlawful act, in thedoing of which justice was in fact obstructed"; to justify a
conviction, it said, "the specific intent to violate the statutemust exist."

Id., at 207. Pettibone did acknowledge, how-ever--and here is the point that is distorted to produce today's opinion--that the specific intent to obstruct justicecould be found where the defendant intentionally committed
a wrongful act that had obstruction of justice as its "naturaland probable consequence."

Ibid.Today's "nexus" requirement sounds like this, but is in reality quite different. Instead of reaffirming that "naturaland probable consequence" is one way of establishing intent,
it substitutes " ` "natural and probable effect" ' " for intent,requiring that factor even when intent to obstruct justice is
otherwise clear. See ante, at 599, quoting United States v.
Wood, 6 F. 3d 692, 695 (CA10 1993), which in turn quotesUnited States v. Thomas, 916 F. 2d 647, 651 (CA11 1990).

2 Thomas, which appears to be the origin of this doctrine, made precisely
the same mistake the Court does. It cited and misapplied earlier Court
of Appeals cases standing for the entirely different principle--flowing
from our language in Pettibone--that to prove an "endeavor" to obstruct
justice, "all the government has to establish is that the defendant should
have reasonably foreseen that the natural and probable consequence of the
success of his scheme would [obstruct the due administration of justice]." United States v. Silverman, 745 F. 2d 1386, 1393 (CA11 1984).

But while it is quite proper to derive an intent requirementfrom $ 1503's use of the word "endeavor," it is quite impossible to derive a "natural and probable consequence" require-ment. One would be "endeavoring" to obstruct justice if
he intentionally set out to do it by means that would onlyunnaturally and improbably be successful. As we said in
Russell, "any effort or essay" corruptly to influence, ob-struct, or impede the due administration of justice constitutes a forbidden endeavor, 255 U. S., at 143, even, as we heldin

Osborn, an effort that is incapable of having that effect,see 385 U. S., at 333.

The Court does not indicate where its "nexus" require-ment is to be found in the words of the statute. Instead, it
justifies its holding with the assertion that "[w]e have tradi-tionally exercised restraint in assessing the reach of a federal
criminal statute, both out of deference to the prerogatives ofCongress and out of concern that a fair warning should be
given . . . of what the law intends to do if a certain line ispassed."

Ante, at 600 (citation and internal quotation marksomitted). But "exercising restraint

in assessing the reachof a federal criminal statute" (which is what the rule of lenity

requires, see United States v. Bass, 404 U. S. 336, 347-348(1971)) is quite different from importing extratextual requirements in order to limit the reach of a federal criminalstatute, which is what the Court has done here. By limiting

$ 1503 to acts having the "natural and probable effect" ofinterfering with the due administration of justice, the Court
effectively reads the word "endeavor," which we said in Russell embraced "any effort or essay" to obstruct justice, 255U. S., at 143, out of the omnibus clause, leaving a prohibition

of only actual obstruction and competent attempts.
does not impose a requirement of "natural and probable consequence," but
approves a manner of proof of "intent." See, e. g., United States
v. Neiswender, 590 F. 2d 1269, 1273 (CA4), cert. denied, 441 U. S. 963
(1979).

The Court apparently adds to its "natural and probableeffect" requirement the requirement that the defendant

know of that natural and probable effect. See ante, at 599("[I]f the defendant lacks knowledge that his actions are
likely to affect the judicial proceeding, he lacks the requisiteintent to obstruct"). Separate proof of such knowledge is
not, I think, required for the orthodox use of the "naturaland probable effect" rule discussed in

Pettibone: Where thedefendant intentionally commits a wrongful act that

in facthas the "natural and probable consequence" of obstructing

justice, "the unintended wrong may derive its character fromthe wrong that was intended." 148 U. S., at 207. Or, as we
would put the point in modern times, the jury is entitledto presume that a person intends the natural and probable
consequences of his acts.While inquiry into the state of the defendant's knowledge
seems quite superfluous to the Court's opinion (since the actperformed did not have the requisite "natural and probable
effect" anyway), it is necessary to my disposition of the case.As I have said, I think an act committed

with intent to ob-struct is all that matters; and what one can fairly be thought

to have intended depends in part upon what one can fairlybe thought to have known. The critical point of knowledge
at issue, in my view, is not whether "respondent knew thathis false statement

would be provided to the grand jury,"
ante, at 601 (emphasis added) (a heightened burden imposed
by the Court's knowledge-of-natural-and-probable-effect re-quirement), but rather whether respondent knew--or indeed, even erroneously believed--that his false statement
might be provided to the grand jury (which is all the knowl-edge needed to support the conclusion that the purpose of

his lie was to mislead the jury). Applying the familiarstandard of

Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307 (1979), to the
proper question, I find that a rational juror could readily

1990). The evidence further established that respondentmade false statements to the FBI agents that minimized his
involvement in the matters the grand jury was investigating.See App. 73, 76, 81, 83-84, 86. Viewing this evidence in the
light most favorable to the Government, I am simply unableto conclude that no rational trier of fact could have found
beyond a reasonable doubt that respondent lied specificallybecause he thought the agents

might convey what he said tothe grand jury--which suffices to constitute a corrupt endeavor to impede the due administration of justice. In fact,I think it would be hard for a juror to conclude otherwise.

III
Since I find against respondent on the $ 1503 count, I mustconsider several other grounds offered by respondent for affirming the Court of Appeals' setting aside of his conviction.First, invoking the interpretive canon of

ejusdem generis, heargues that, since all the rest of $ 1503 refers only to actions

directed at jurors and court officers,3 the omnibus clause can3 Those clauses provide:
"Whoever corruptly, or by threats or force, or by any threatening letter
or communication, endeavors to influence, intimidate, or impede any grand
or petit juror, or officer in or of any court of the United States, or officer
who may be serving at any examination or other proceeding before any

not apply to actions directed at witnesses. But the rule of
ejusdem generis, which "limits general terms which follow
specific ones to matters similar to those specified," Gooch v.
United States, 297 U. S. 124, 128 (1936); accord, Harrison v.
PPG Industries, Inc., 446 U. S. 578, 588 (1980), has no application here. Although something of a catchall, the omnibus
clause is not a general or collective term following a list of
specific items to which a particular statutory command is
applicable (e. g., "fishing rods, nets, hooks, bobbers, sinkers,
and other equipment"). Rather, it is one of the several distinct and independent prohibitions contained in $ 1503 that
share only the word "Whoever," which begins the statute,
and the penalty provision which ends it. Indeed, given the
already broad terms of the other clauses in $ 1503, to limit
the omnibus clause in the manner respondent urges would
render it superfluous. See United States v. Howard, 569
F. 2d 1331, 1333 (CA5 1978).

Respondent next contends that because Congress in 1982
enacted a different statute, 18 U. S. C. $ 1512, dealing with
witness tampering, and simultaneously removed from $ 1503
the provisions it had previously contained specifically addressing efforts to influence or injure witnesses, see Victim
and Witness Protection Act of 1982, Pub. L. 97-291, 96 Stat.
1249-1250, 1253, his witness-related conduct is no longer
punishable under the omnibus clause of $ 1503. The 1982
amendment, however, did nothing to alter the omnibus
clause, which by its terms encompasses corrupt "endeavors
to influence, obstruct, or impede, the due administration of

United States commissioner or other committing magistrate, in the discharge of his duty, or injures any such grand or petit juror in his person
or property on account of any verdict or indictment assented to by him,
or on account of his being or having been such juror, or injures any such
officer, commissioner, or other committing magistrate in his person or
property on account of the performance of his official duties . . . shall be
fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or
both." 18 U. S. C. $ 1503.

justice." The fact that there is now some overlap between$ 1503 and $ 1512 is no more intolerable than the fact that

there is some overlap between the omnibus clause of $ 1503and the other provisions of $ 1503 itself. It hardly leads to
the conclusion that $ 1503 was, to the extent of the overlap,silently repealed. It is not unusual for a particular act to
violate more than one criminal statute, see, e. g., Gavieres v.
United States, 220 U. S. 338, 342 (1911), and in such situationsthe Government may proceed under any statute that applies,

see, e. g., United States v. Batchelder, 442 U. S. 114, 123-124(1979); United States v. Beacon Brass Co., 344 U. S. 43, 45-46
(1952). It is, moreover, "a cardinal principle of statutoryconstruction that repeals by implication are not favored."
United States v. United Continental Tuna Corp., 425 U. S.164, 168 (1976); see also

Posadas v. National City Bank, 296U. S. 497, 503 (1936).

Finally, respondent posits that the phrase " `corruptly . . .endeavors to influence, obstruct, or impede' may be unconstitutionally vague," in that it fails to provide sufficient noticethat lying to potential grand jury witnesses in an effort to
thwart a grand jury investigation is proscribed. Brief forRespondent 22, n. 13. Statutory language need not be colloquial, however, and the term "corruptly" in criminal laws hasa longstanding and well-accepted meaning. It denotes "[a]n
act done with an intent to give some advantage inconsistentwith official duty and the rights of others. . . . It includes
bribery but is more comprehensive; because an act may becorruptly done though the advantage to be derived from it
be not offered by another." United States v. Ogle, 613 F. 2d233, 238 (CA10) (internal quotation marks omitted), cert. denied, 449 U. S. 825 (1980). See also Ballentine's Law Dic-tionary 276 (3d ed. 1969); Black's Law Dictionary 345 (6th
ed. 1990). As the District Court here instructed the jury:

"An act is done corruptly if it's done voluntarily and in-tentionally to bring about either an unlawful result or a

lawful result by some unlawful method, with a hope or

expectation of either financial gain or other benefit tooneself or a benefit of another person." App. 117.

Moreover, in the context of obstructing jury proceedings,any claim of ignorance of wrongdoing is incredible. Acts
specifically intended to "influence, obstruct, or impede, thedue administration of justice" are obviously wrongful, just
as they are necessarily "corrupt." See Ogle, supra, at 239;United States v. North, 910 F. 2d 843, 941 (CADC) (Silberman, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), modified,920 F. 2d 940 (1990);

United States v. Reeves, 752 F. 2d 995,999 (CA5), cert. denied, 474 U. S. 834 (1985).

The "nexus" requirement that the Court today engraftsinto $ 1503 has no basis in the words Congress enacted. I

would reverse that part of the Court of Appeals' judgmentwhich set aside respondent's conviction under that statute.

FLORIDA BAR v. WENT FOR IT, INC., et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eleventh circuit

No. 94-226. Argued January 11, 1995--Decided June 21, 1995
Respondent lawyer referral service and an individual Florida attorney

filed this action for declaratory and injunctive relief challenging, as
violative of the First and Fourteenth Amendments, Florida Bar (Bar)
Rules prohibiting personal injury lawyers from sending targeted
direct-mail solicitations to victims and their relatives for 30 days following an accident or disaster. The District Court entered summary judgment for the plaintiffs, relying on Bates v. State Bar of Ariz., 433 U. S.
350, and subsequent cases. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed on similar
grounds.

Held: In the circumstances presented here, the Bar Rules do not violate

the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Pp. 622-635.

(a) Bates and its progeny establish that lawyer advertising is commercial speech and, as such, is accorded only a limited measure of First
Amendment protection. Under the "intermediate" scrutiny framework
set forth in Central Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n
of N. Y., 447 U. S. 557, a restriction on commercial speech that, like
the advertising at issue, does not concern unlawful activity and is not
misleading is permissible if the government: (1) asserts a substantial
interest in support of its regulation; (2) establishes that the restriction
directly and materially advances that interest; and (3) demonstrates that
the regulation is " `narrowly drawn,' " id., at 564-565. Pp. 622-624.

(b) The Bar's 30-day ban on targeted direct-mail solicitation withstands Central Hudson scrutiny. First, the Bar has substantial interest both in protecting the privacy and tranquility of personal injury
victims and their loved ones against invasive, unsolicited contact by lawyers and in preventing the erosion of confidence in the profession that
such repeated invasions have engendered. Second, the fact that the
harms targeted by the ban are quite real is demonstrated by a Bar
study, effectively unrebutted by respondents below, that contains extensive statistical and anecdotal data suggesting that the Florida public
views direct-mail solicitations in the immediate wake of accidents as an
intrusion on privacy that reflects poorly upon the profession. Edenfield v. Fane, 507 U. S. 761, 771-772; Shapero v. Kentucky Bar Assn.,
486 U. S. 466, 475-476; and Bolger v. Youngs Drug Products Corp., 463

620 FLORIDA BAR v. WENT FOR IT, INC.

Opinion of the Court
Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court.
Rules of the Florida Bar prohibit personal injury lawyersfrom sending targeted direct-mail solicitations to victims and

their relatives for 30 days following an accident or disaster.This case asks us to consider whether such Rules violate the
First and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution. Wehold that in the circumstances presented here, they do not.

I
In 1989, the Florida Bar (Bar) completed a 2-year study ofthe effects of lawyer advertising on public opinion. After

conducting hearings, commissioning surveys, and reviewingextensive public commentary, the Bar determined that several changes to its advertising rules were in order. In late1990, the Florida Supreme Court adopted the Bar's proposed
amendments with some modifications. The Florida Bar:Petition to Amend the Rules Regulating the Florida Bar--
Advertising Issues, 571 So. 2d 451 (Fla. 1990). Two of theseamendments are at issue in this case. Rule 4-7.4(b)(1) provides that "[a] lawyer shall not send, or knowingly permit tobe sent, . . . a written communication to a prospective client
for the purpose of obtaining professional employment if: (A)the written communication concerns an action for personal
injury or wrongful death or otherwise relates to an accidentor disaster involving the person to whom the communication
is addressed or a relative of that person, unless the accidentor disaster occurred more than 30 days prior to the mailing
of the communication." Rule 4-7.8(a) states that "[a] lawyershall not accept referrals from a lawyer referral service unless the service: (1) engages in no communication with thepublic and in no direct contact with prospective clients in a
manner that would violate the Rules of Professional Conductif the communication or contact were made by the lawyer."
Together, these Rules create a brief 30-day blackout periodafter an accident during which lawyers may not, directly or

Opinion of the Court
indirectly, single out accident victims or their relatives in
order to solicit their business.

In March 1992, G. Stewart McHenry and his wholly owned
lawyer referral service, Went For It, Inc., filed this action
for declaratory and injunctive relief in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida challenging
Rules 4-7.4(b)(1) and 4-7.8(a) as violative of the First and
Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution. McHenry alleged that he routinely sent targeted solicitations to accident
victims or their survivors within 30 days after accidents and
that he wished to continue doing so in the future. Went For
It, Inc., represented that it wished to contact accident victims or their survivors within 30 days of accidents and to
refer potential clients to participating Florida lawyers. In
October 1992, McHenry was disbarred for reasons unrelated
to this suit, Florida Bar v. McHenry, 605 So. 2d 459 (Fla.
1992). Another Florida lawyer, John T. Blakely, was substituted in his stead.

The District Court referred the parties' competing summary judgment motions to a Magistrate Judge, who concluded that the Bar had substantial government interests,
predicated on a concern for professionalism, both in protecting the personal privacy and tranquility of recent accident
victims and their relatives and in ensuring that these individuals do not fall prey to undue influence or overreaching.
Citing the Bar's extensive study, the Magistrate Judge found
that the Rules directly serve those interests and sweep no
further than reasonably necessary. The Magistrate recommended that the District Court grant the Bar's motion for
summary judgment on the ground that the Rules pass constitutional muster.

The District Court rejected the Magistrate Judge's report
and recommendations and entered summary judgment for
the plaintiffs, 808 F. Supp. 1543 (MD Fla. 1992), relying on
Bates v. State Bar of Ariz., 433 U. S. 350 (1977), and sub515us2$86j 08-17-98 13:33:22 PAGES OPINPGT

sequent cases. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed on similargrounds, McHenry v. Florida Bar, 21 F. 3d 1038 (1994). The

panel noted, in its conclusion, that it was "disturbed thatBates and its progeny require the decision" that it reached,
21 F. 3d, at 1045. We granted certiorari, 512 U. S. 1289(1994), and now reverse.

II

A
Constitutional protection for attorney advertising, and forcommercial speech generally, is of recent vintage. Until the

mid-1970's, we adhered to the broad rule laid out in Valentine v. Chrestensen, 316 U. S. 52, 54 (1942), that, while theFirst Amendment guards against government restriction of

speech in most contexts, "the Constitution imposes no suchrestraint on government as respects purely commercial
advertising." In 1976, the Court changed course. In
Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens ConsumerCouncil, Inc., 425 U. S. 748, we invalidated a state statute

barring pharmacists from advertising prescription drugprices. At issue was speech that involved the idea that " `I
will sell you the X prescription drug at the Y price.' " Id.,at 761. Striking the ban as unconstitutional, we rejected
the argument that such speech "is so removed from `anyexposition of ideas,' and from `truth, science, morality, and
arts in general, in its diffusion of liberal sentiments on theadministration of Government,' that it lacks all protection."
Id., at 762 (citations omitted).In

Virginia Bd., the Court limited its holding to advertis-ing by pharmacists, noting that "[p]hysicians and lawyers . . .

do not dispense standardized products; they render profes-sional

services of almost infinite variety and nature, with theconsequent enhanced possibility for confusion and deception

if they were to undertake certain kinds of advertising." Id.,at 773, n. 25 (emphasis in original). One year later, however,
the Court applied the Virginia Bd. principles to invalidatea state rule prohibiting lawyers from advertising in news515us2$86j 08-17-98 13:33:22 PAGES OPINPGT

623Cite as: 515 U. S. 618 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
papers and other media. In Bates v. State Bar of Arizona,
supra, the Court struck a ban on price advertising for what
it deemed "routine" legal services: "the uncontested divorce,the simple adoption, the uncontested personal bankruptcy,

the change of name, and the like." 433 U. S., at 372. Expressing confidence that legal advertising would only bepracticable for such simple, standardized services, the Court

rejected the State's proffered justifications for regulation.Nearly two decades of cases have built upon the foundation laid by Bates. It is now well established that lawyeradvertising is commercial speech and, as such, is accorded a
measure of First Amendment protection. See, e. g., Shapero
v. Kentucky Bar Assn., 486 U. S. 466, 472 (1988); Zauderer
v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel of Supreme Court of Ohio,
471 U. S. 626, 637 (1985); In re R. M. J., 455 U. S. 191, 199
(1982). Such First Amendment protection, of course, is not
absolute. We have always been careful to distinguish commercial speech from speech at the First Amendment's core.
" `[C]ommercial speech [enjoys] a limited measure of protection, commensurate with its subordinate position in the scale
of First Amendment values,' and is subject to `modes of
regulation that might be impermissible in the realm of noncommercial expression.' " Board of Trustees of State Univ.
of N. Y. v. Fox, 492 U. S. 469, 477 (1989), quoting Ohralik v.
Ohio State Bar Assn., 436 U. S. 447, 456 (1978). We have
observed that " `[t]o require a parity of constitutional protection for commercial and noncommercial speech alike could
invite dilution, simply by a leveling process, of the force of
the Amendment's guarantee with respect to the latter kind
of speech.' " 492 U. S., at 481, quoting Ohralik, supra, at
456.

Mindful of these concerns, we engage in "intermediate"
scrutiny of restrictions on commercial speech, analyzing
them under the framework set forth in Central Hudson
Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U. S.
557 (1980). Under Central Hudson, the government may

624 FLORIDA BAR v. WENT FOR IT, INC.

Opinion of the Court
freely regulate commercial speech that concerns unlawful ac-tivity or is misleading. Id., at 563-564. Commercial speech

that falls into neither of those categories, like the advertisingat issue here, may be regulated if the government satisfies a
test consisting of three related prongs: First, the govern-ment must assert a substantial interest in support of its regulation; second, the government must demonstrate that therestriction on commercial speech directly and materially advances that interest; and third, the regulation must be " `nar-rowly drawn.' "

Id., at 564-565.

B
"Unlike rational basis review, the Central Hudson stand-ard does not permit us to supplant the precise interests put

forward by the State with other suppositions," Edenfield v.Fane, 507 U. S. 761, 768 (1993). The Bar asserts that it has
a substantial interest in protecting the privacy and tran-quility of personal injury victims and their loved ones
against intrusive, unsolicited contact by lawyers. See Brieffor Petitioner 8, 25-27; 21 F. 3d, at 1043-1044.

1 This interest

obviously factors into the Bar's paramount (and repeatedlyprofessed) objective of curbing activities that "negatively

affec[t] the administration of justice." The Florida Bar:Petition to Amend the Rules Regulating the Florida Bar--
Advertising Issues, 571 So. 2d, at 455; see also Brief forPetitioner 7, 14, 24; 21 F. 3d, at 1043 (describing Bar's effort "to preserve the integrity of the legal profession").

1 At prior stages of this litigation, the Bar asserted a different interest,
in addition to that urged now, in protecting people against undue influence
and overreaching. See 21 F. 3d, at 1042-1043; cf. Shapero v. Kentucky
Bar Assn., 486 U. S. 466, 474-476 (1988); Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Assn.,
436 U. S. 447, 462 (1978). Because the Bar does not press this interest
before us, we do not consider it. Of course, our precedents do not require
the Bar to point to more than one interest in support of its 30-day restriction; a single substantial interest is sufficient to satisfy Central Hudson's
first prong. See Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co., 514 U. S. 476, 485 (1995)
(deeming only one of the government's proffered interests "substantial").

515us2$86j 08-17-98 13:33:22 PAGES OPINPGT

625Cite as: 515 U. S. 618 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
Because direct-mail solicitations in the wake of accidents areperceived by the public as intrusive, the Bar argues, the reputation of the legal profession in the eyes of Floridians hassuffered commensurately. See Pet. for Cert. 14-15; Brief
for Petitioner 28-29. The regulation, then, is an effort to
protect the flagging reputations of Florida lawyers by pre-venting them from engaging in conduct that, the Bar maintains, " `is universally regarded as deplorable and beneathcommon decency because of its intrusion upon the special
vulnerability and private grief of victims or their families.' "Brief for Petitioner 28, quoting

In re Anis, 126 N. J. 448, 458,
599 A. 2d 1265, 1270 (1992).

We have little trouble crediting the Bar's interest as substantial. On various occasions we have accepted the proposition that "States have a compelling interest in the practice
of professions within their boundaries, and . . . as part of
their power to protect the public health, safety, and other
valid interests they have broad power to establish standards
for licensing practitioners and regulating the practice of professions." Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, 421 U. S. 773, 792
(1975); see also Ohralik, supra, at 460; Cohen v. Hurley, 366
U. S. 117, 124 (1961). Our precedents also leave no room for
doubt that "the protection of potential clients' privacy is a
substantial state interest." See Edenfield, supra, at 769.
In other contexts, we have consistently recognized that
"[t]he State's interest in protecting the well-being, tranquility, and privacy of the home is certainly of the highest order
in a free and civilized society." Carey v. Brown, 447 U. S.
455, 471 (1980). Indeed, we have noted that "a special benefit of the privacy all citizens enjoy within their own walls,
which the State may legislate to protect, is an ability to
avoid intrusions." Frisby v. Schultz, 487 U. S. 474, 484-
485 (1988).

Under Central Hudson's second prong, the State must
demonstrate that the challenged regulation "advances the
Government's interest `in a direct and material way.' "

515us2$86j 08-17-98 13:33:22 PAGES OPINPGT
626 FLORIDA BAR v. WENT FOR IT, INC.

Opinion of the Court
Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co., 514 U. S. 476, 487 (1995), quoting
Edenfield, supra, at 767. That burden, we have explained,
" `is not satisfied by mere speculation or conjecture; rather,a governmental body seeking to sustain a restriction on commercial speech must demonstrate that the harms it recites
are real and that its restriction will in fact alleviate them toa material degree.' " 514 U. S., at 487, quoting

Edenfield,
supra, at 770-771. In Edenfield, the Court invalidated aFlorida ban on in-person solicitation by certified public accountants (CPA's). We observed that the State Board of Ac-countancy had "present[ed] no studies that suggest personal
solicitation of prospective business clients by CPA's creates
the dangers of fraud, overreaching, or compromised independence that the Board claims to fear." 507 U. S., at 771.
Moreover, "[t]he record [did] not disclose any anecdotal evidence, either from Florida or another State, that validate[d]
the Board's suppositions." Ibid. In fact, we concluded that
the only evidence in the record tended to "contradic[t], rather
than strengthe[n], the Board's submissions." Id., at 772.
Finding nothing in the record to substantiate the State's allegations of harm, we invalidated the regulation.

The direct-mail solicitation regulation before us does not
suffer from such infirmities. The Bar submitted a 106-
page summary of its 2-year study of lawyer advertising
and solicitation to the District Court. That summary contains data--both statistical and anecdotal--supporting the
Bar's contentions that the Florida public views direct-mail
solicitations in the immediate wake of accidents as an intrusion on privacy that reflects poorly upon the profession. As
of June 1989, lawyers mailed 700,000 direct solicitations in
Florida annually, 40% of which were aimed at accident victims or their survivors. Summary of the Record in No.
74,987 (Fla.) on Petition to Amend the Rules Regulating
Lawyer Advertising (hereinafter Summary of Record), App.
H, p. 2. A survey of Florida adults commissioned by the
Bar indicated that Floridians "have negative feelings about

Opinion of the Court
those attorneys who use direct mail advertising." MagidAssociates, Attitudes & Opinions Toward Direct Mail Advertising by Attorneys (Dec. 1987), Summary of Record, App.C(4), p. 6. Fifty-four percent of the general population surveyed said that contacting persons concerning accidents or
similar events is a violation of privacy. Id., at 7. A randomsampling of persons who received direct-mail advertising

from lawyers in 1987 revealed that 45% believed that direct-mail solicitation is "designed to take advantage of gullible or
unstable people"; 34% found such tactics "annoying or irri-tating"; 26% found it "an invasion of your privacy"; and 24%
reported that it "made you angry." Ibid. Significantly,
27% of direct-mail recipients reported that their regard for
the legal profession and for the judicial process as a whole
was "lower" as a result of receiving the direct mail. Ibid.

The anecdotal record mustered by the Bar is noteworthy
for its breadth and detail. With titles like "Scavenger Lawyers" (The Miami Herald, Sept. 29, 1987) and "Solicitors Out
of Bounds" (St. Petersburg Times, Oct. 26, 1987), newspaper
editorial pages in Florida have burgeoned with criticism of
Florida lawyers who send targeted direct mail to victims
shortly after accidents. See Summary of Record, App. B,
pp. 1-8 (excerpts from articles); see also Peltz, Legal Advertising--Opening Pandora's Box, 19 Stetson L. Rev. 43, 116
(1989) (listing Florida editorials critical of direct-mail solicitation of accident victims in 1987, several of which are referenced in the record). The study summary also includes page
upon page of excerpts from complaints of direct-mail recipients. For example, a Florida citizen described how he was
" `appalled and angered by the brazen attempt' " of a law firm
to solicit him by letter shortly after he was injured and his
fiancee was killed in an auto accident. Summary of Record,
App. I(1), p. 2. Another found it " `despicable and inexcusable' " that a Pensacola lawyer wrote to his mother three
days after his father's funeral. Ibid. Another described
how she was " `astounded' " and then " `very angry' " when

she received a solicitation following a minor accident. Id.,at 3. Still another described as " `beyond comprehension' "

a letter his nephew's family received the day of the nephew'sfuneral.

Ibid. One citizen wrote, " `I consider the unsolicited contact from you after my child's accident to be of the
rankest form of ambulance chasing and in incredibly poortaste. . . . I cannot begin to express with my limited vocabulary the utter contempt in which I hold you and yourkind.' "

Ibid.
In light of this showing--which respondents at no time re-futed, save by the conclusory assertion that the Rule lacked

"any factual basis," Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment and Supplementary Memorandum of Law in No. 92-370-
Civ. (MD Fla.), p. 5--we conclude that the Bar has satisfied
the second prong of the Central Hudson test. In dissent,
Justice Kennedy complains that we have before us few
indications of the sample size or selection procedures employed by Magid Associates (a nationally renowned consulting firm) and no copies of the actual surveys employed. See
post, at 640. As stated, we believe the evidence adduced
by the Bar is sufficient to meet the standard elaborated in
Edenfield v. Fane, 507 U. S. 761 (1993). In any event, we do
not read our case law to require that empirical data come
to us accompanied by a surfeit of background information.
Indeed, in other First Amendment contexts, we have permitted litigants to justify speech restrictions by reference to
studies and anecdotes pertaining to different locales altogether, see Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U. S. 41,
50-51 (1986); Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U. S. 560,
584-585 (1991) (Souter, J., concurring in judgment), or even,
in a case applying strict scrutiny, to justify restrictions based
solely on history, consensus, and "simple common sense,"
Burson v. Freeman, 504 U. S. 191, 211 (1992). Nothing in
Edenfield, a case in which the State offered no evidence or
anecdotes in support of its restriction, requires more. After
scouring the record, we are satisfied that the ban on direct515us2$86j 08-17-98 13:33:22 PAGES OPINPGT

629Cite as: 515 U. S. 618 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
mail solicitation in the immediate aftermath of accidents, un-like the rule at issue in

Edenfield, targets a concrete, nonspeculative harm.In reaching a contrary conclusion, the Court of Appeals

determined that this case was governed squarely by Shapero
v. Kentucky Bar Assn., 486 U. S. 466 (1988). Making nomention of the Bar's study, the court concluded that " `a targeted letter [does not] invade the recipient's privacy anymore than does a substantively identical letter mailed at
large. The invasion, if any, occurs when the lawyer dis-covers the recipient's legal affairs, not when he confronts the
recipient with the discovery.' " 21 F. 3d, at 1044, quoting
Shapero, supra, at 476. In many cases, the Court of Appeals explained, "this invasion of privacy will involve no
more than reading the newspaper." 21 F. 3d, at 1044.

While some of Shapero's language might be read to support the Court of Appeals' interpretation, Shapero differs in
several fundamental respects from the case before us. First
and foremost, Shapero's treatment of privacy was casual.
Contrary to the dissent's suggestions, post, at 637-638, the
State in Shapero did not seek to justify its regulation as a
measure undertaken to prevent lawyers' invasions of privacy
interests. See generally Brief for Respondent in Shapero v.
Kentucky Bar Assn., O. T. 1987, No. 87-16. Rather, the
State focused exclusively on the special dangers of overreaching inhering in targeted solicitations. Ibid. Second,
in contrast to this case, Shapero dealt with a broad ban on
all direct-mail solicitations, whatever the time frame and
whoever the recipient. Finally, the State in Shapero assembled no evidence attempting to demonstrate any actual harm
caused by targeted direct mail. The Court rejected the
State's effort to justify a prophylactic ban on the basis of
blanket, untested assertions of undue influence and overreaching. 486 U. S., at 475. Because the State did not
make a privacy-based argument at all, its empirical showing
on that issue was similarly infirm.

630 FLORIDA BAR v. WENT FOR IT, INC.

Opinion of the Court
We find the Court's perfunctory treatment of privacy in
Shapero to be of little utility in assessing this ban on targeted solicitation of victims in the immediate aftermath of
accidents. While it is undoubtedly true that many people
find the image of lawyers sifting through accident and police
reports in pursuit of prospective clients unpalatable and invasive, this case targets a different kind of intrusion. The
Bar has argued, and the record reflects, that a principal purpose of the ban is "protecting the personal privacy and tranquility of [Florida's] citizens from crass commercial intrusion
by attorneys upon their personal grief in times of trauma."
Brief for Petitioner 8; cf. Summary of Record, App. I(1) (citizen commentary describing outrage at lawyers' timing in
sending solicitation letters). The intrusion targeted by the
Bar's regulation stems not from the fact that a lawyer has
learned about an accident or disaster (as the Court of Appeals notes, in many instances a lawyer need only read the
newspaper to glean this information), but from the lawyer's
confrontation of victims or relatives with such information,
while wounds are still open, in order to solicit their business.
In this respect, an untargeted letter mailed to society at
large is different in kind from a targeted solicitation; the
untargeted letter involves no willful or knowing affront to or
invasion of the tranquility of bereaved or injured individuals
and simply does not cause the same kind of reputational
harm to the profession unearthed by the Bar's study.

Nor do we find Bolger v. Youngs Drug Products Corp., 463
U. S. 60 (1983), dispositive of the issue, despite any superficial
resemblance. In Bolger, we rejected the Federal Government's paternalistic effort to ban potentially "offensive" and
"intrusive" direct-mail advertisements for contraceptives.
Minimizing the Government's allegations of harm, we reasoned that "[r]ecipients of objectionable mailings . . . may
` "effectively avoid further bombardment of their sensibilities
simply by averting their eyes." ' " Id., at 72, quoting Con515us2$86j 08-17-98 13:33:22 PAGES OPINPGT

solidated Edison Co. of N. Y. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of
N. Y., 447 U. S. 530, 542 (1980), in turn quoting Cohen v. California, 403 U. S. 15, 21 (1971). We found that the " `short,though regular, journey from mail box to trash can . . . is

an acceptable burden, at least so far as the Constitution is
concerned.' " 463 U. S., at 72 (ellipses in original), quoting
Lamont v. Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, 269 F. Supp.
880, 883 (SDNY), summarily aff 'd, 386 F. 2d 449 (CA2 1967).Concluding that citizens have at their disposal ample means

of averting any substantial injury inhering in the delivery ofobjectionable contraceptive material, we deemed the State's
intercession unnecessary and unduly restrictive.Here, in contrast, the harm targeted by the Bar cannot be
eliminated by a brief journey to the trash can. The purpose
of the 30-day targeted direct-mail ban is to forestall the out-rage and irritation with the state-licensed legal profession

that the practice of direct solicitation only days after accidents has engendered. The Bar is concerned not with citizens' "offense" in the abstract, see post, at 638-639, but with
the demonstrable detrimental effects that such "offense" has
on the profession it regulates. See Brief for Petitioner 7,
14, 24, 28.2 Moreover, the harm posited by the Bar is as
much a function of simple receipt of targeted solicitations
within days of accidents as it is a function of the letters'
contents. Throwing the letter away shortly after opening it
may minimize the latter intrusion, but it does little to combat the former. We see no basis in Bolger, nor in the
other, similar cases cited by the dissent, post, at 638-639,
for dismissing the Bar's assertions of harm, particularly

2 Missing this nuance altogether, the dissent asserts apocalyptically that
we are "unsettl[ing] leading First Amendment precedents," post, at 635,
639-640. We do no such thing. There is an obvious difference between
situations in which the government acts in its own interests, or on behalf
of entities it regulates, and situations in which the government is motivated primarily by paternalism. The cases cited by the dissent, post, at
638-639, focus on the latter situation.

Opinion of the Court
given the unrefuted empirical and anecdotal basis for theBar's conclusions.

Passing to Central Hudson's third prong, we examine therelationship between the Bar's interests and the means chosen to serve them. See Board of Trustees of State Univ. of
N. Y. v. Fox, 492 U. S., at 480. With respect to this prong,the differences between commercial speech and noncommercial speech are manifest. In Fox, we made clear that the"least restrictive means" test has no role in the commercial
speech context. Ibid. "What our decisions require," in-stead, "is a `fit' between the legislature's ends and the means
chosen to accomplish those ends,' a fit that is not necessarily
perfect, but reasonable; that represents not necessarily the
single best disposition but one whose scope is `in proportion
to the interest served,' that employs not necessarily the least
restrictive means but . . . a means narrowly tailored to
achieve the desired objective." Ibid. (citations omitted).
Of course, we do not equate this test with the less rigorous
obstacles of rational basis review; in Cincinnati v. Discovery
Network, Inc., 507 U. S. 410, 417, n. 13 (1993), for example,
we observed that the existence of "numerous and obvious
less-burdensome alternatives to the restriction on commercial speech . . . is certainly a relevant consideration in
determining whether the `fit' between ends and means is
reasonable."

Respondents levy a great deal of criticism, echoed in the
dissent, post, at 642-644, at the scope of the Bar's restriction
on targeted mail. "[B]y prohibiting written communications
to all people, whatever their state of mind," respondents
charge, the Rule "keeps useful information from those accident victims who are ready, willing and able to utilize a lawyer's advice." Brief for Respondents 14. This criticism
may be parsed into two components. First, the Rule does
not distinguish between victims in terms of the severity of
their injuries. According to respondents, the Rule is unconstitutionally overinclusive insofar as it bans targeted mail515us2$86j 08-17-98 13:33:22 PAGES OPINPGT

633Cite as: 515 U. S. 618 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
ings even to citizens whose injuries or grief are relativelyminor.

Id., at 15. Second, the Rule may prevent citizens
from learning about their legal options, particularly at a timewhen other actors--opposing counsel and insurance adjusters--may be clamoring for victims' attentions. Any benefit
arising from the Bar's regulation, respondents implicitly con-tend, is outweighed by these costs.

We are not persuaded by respondents' allegations of con-stitutional infirmity. We find little deficiency in the ban's
failure to distinguish among injured Floridians by the sever-ity of their pain or the intensity of their grief. Indeed, it is
hard to imagine the contours of a regulation that might satisfy respondents on this score. Rather than drawing difficult lines on the basis that some injuries are "severe" and
some situations appropriate (and others, presumably, inappropriate) for grief, anger, or emotion, the Bar has crafted a
ban applicable to all postaccident or disaster solicitations for
a brief 30-day period. Unlike respondents, we do not see
"numerous and obvious less-burdensome alternatives" to
Florida's short temporal ban. Cincinnati, supra, at 417,
n. 13. The Bar's rule is reasonably well tailored to its stated
objective of eliminating targeted mailings whose type
and timing are a source of distress to Floridians, distress
that has caused many of them to lose respect for the legal
profession.

Respondents' second point would have force if the Bar's
Rule were not limited to a brief period and if there were not
many other ways for injured Floridians to learn about the
availability of legal representation during that time. Our
lawyer advertising cases have afforded lawyers a great deal
of leeway to devise innovative ways to attract new business.
Florida permits lawyers to advertise on prime-time television and radio as well as in newspapers and other media.
They may rent space on billboards. They may send untargeted letters to the general population, or to discrete segments thereof. There are, of course, pages upon pages de515us2$86j 08-17-98 13:33:22 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
voted to lawyers in the Yellow Pages of Florida telephonedirectories. These listings are organized alphabetically and

by area of specialty. See generally Rule 4-7.2(a), RulesRegulating The Florida Bar ("[A] lawyer may advertise services through public media, such as a telephone directory,legal directory, newspaper or other periodical, billboards and
other signs, radio, television, and recorded messages thepublic may access by dialing a telephone number, or through
written communication not involving solicitation as definedin rule 4-7.4");

The Florida Bar: Petition to Amend theRules Regulating the Florida Bar--Advertising Issues, 571

So. 2d, at 461. These ample alternative channels for receiptof information about the availability of legal representation
during the 30-day period following accidents may explainwhy, despite the ample evidence, testimony, and commentary submitted by those favoring (as well as opposing)unrestricted direct-mail solicitation, respondents have not
pointed to--and we have not independently found--a singleexample of an individual case in which immediate solicitation
helped to avoid, or failure to solicit within 30 days broughtabout, the harms that concern the dissent, see post, at 643.
In fact, the record contains considerable empirical surveyinformation suggesting that Floridians have little difficulty
finding a lawyer when they need one. See, e. g., Summaryof Record, App. C(4), p. 7; id., App. C(5), p. 8. Finding no
basis to question the commonsense conclusion that the manyalternative channels for communicating necessary information about attorneys are sufficient, we see no defect in Flori-da's regulation.

III
Speech by professionals obviously has many dimensions.There are circumstances in which we will accord speech by

attorneys on public issues and matters of legal representa-tion the strongest protection our Constitution has to offer.
See, e. g., Gentile v. State Bar of Nevada, 501 U. S. 1030(1991); In re Primus, 436 U. S. 412 (1978). This case, how515us2$86j 08-17-98 13:33:22 PAGES OPINPGT

Kennedy, J., dissenting
ever, concerns pure commercial advertising, for which wehave always reserved a lesser degree of protection under the

First Amendment. Particularly because the standards andconduct of state-licensed lawyers have traditionally been
subject to extensive regulation by the States, it is all themore appropriate that we limit our scrutiny of state regulations to a level commensurate with the " `subordinate posi-tion' " of commercial speech in the scale of First Amendment
values. Fox, 492 U. S., at 477, quoting Ohralik, 436 U. S.,at 456.

We believe that the Bar's 30-day restriction on targeteddirect-mail solicitation of accident victims and their relatives
withstands scrutiny under the three-pronged Central Hud-son test that we have devised for this context. The Bar
has substantial interest both in protecting injured Floridiansfrom invasive conduct by lawyers and in preventing the erosion of confidence in the profession that such repeated inva-sions have engendered. The Bar's proffered study, unrebutted by respondents below, provides evidence indicating thatthe harms it targets are far from illusory. The palliative
devised by the Bar to address these harms is narrow both inscope and in duration. The Constitution, in our view, requires nothing more.The judgment of the Court of Appeals, accordingly, is

Reversed.
Justice Kennedy, with whom Justice Stevens, Justice Souter, and Justice Ginsburg join, dissenting.

Attorneys who communicate their willingness to assist po-tential clients are engaged in speech protected by the First

and Fourteenth Amendments. That principle has been un-derstood since Bates v. State Bar of Ariz., 433 U. S. 350
(1977). The Court today undercuts this guarantee in an im-portant class of cases and unsettles leading First Amendment precedents, at the expense of those victims most inneed of legal assistance. With all respect for the Court, in

636 FLORIDA BAR v. WENT FOR IT, INC.

Kennedy, J., dissenting
my view its solicitude for the privacy of victims and its con-cern for our profession are misplaced and self-defeating, even

upon the Court's own premises.I take it to be uncontroverted that when an accident
results in death or injury, it is often urgent at once to investigate the occurrence, identify witnesses, and preserveevidence. Vital interests in speech and expression are,

therefore, at stake when by law an attorney cannot direct aletter to the victim or the family explaining this simple fact
and offering competent legal assistance. Meanwhile, repre-sented and better informed parties, or parties who have been
solicited in ways more sophisticated and indirect, may be at
work. Indeed, these parties, either themselves or by their
attorneys, investigators, and adjusters, are free to contact
the unrepresented persons to gather evidence or offer settlement. This scheme makes little sense. As is often true
when the law makes little sense, it is not first principles but
their interpretation and application that have gone awry.

Although I agree with the Court that the case can be resolved by following the three-part inquiry we have identified
to assess restrictions on commercial speech, Central Hudson
Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U. S.
557, 566 (1980), a preliminary observation is in order.
Speech has the capacity to convey complex substance, yielding various insights and interpretations depending upon the
identity of the listener or the reader and the context of its
transmission. It would oversimplify to say that what we
consider here is commercial speech and nothing more, for in
many instances the banned communications may be vital to
the recipients' right to petition the courts for redress of
grievances. The complex nature of expression is one reason
why even so-called commercial speech has become an essential part of the public discourse the First Amendment secures. See, e. g., Edenfield v. Fane, 507 U. S. 761, 766-767
(1993). If our commercial speech rules are to control this
case, then, it is imperative to apply them with exacting care

and fidelity to our precedents, for what is at stake is thesuppression of information and knowledge that transcends

the financial self-interests of the speaker.

I
As the Court notes, the first of the Central Hudson factorsto be considered is whether the interest the State pursues

in enacting the speech restriction is a substantial one. Ante,at 624. The State says two different interests meet this
standard. The first is the interest "in protecting the personalprivacy and tranquility" of the victim and his or her family.
Brief for Petitioner 8. As the Court notes, that interest hasrecognition in our decisions as a general matter; but it does
not follow that the privacy interest in the cases the majoritycites is applicable here. The problem the Court confronts,
and cannot overcome, is our recent decision in Shapero v.
Kentucky Bar Assn., 486 U. S. 466 (1988). In assessing theimportance of the interest in that solicitation case, we made

an explicit distinction between direct, in-person solicitationsand direct-mail solicitations. Shapero, like this case, involved a direct-mail solicitation, and there the State recitedits fears of "overreaching and undue influence." Id., at 475.
We found, however, no such dangers presented by direct-mailadvertising. We reasoned that "[a] letter, like a printed advertisement (but unlike a lawyer), can readily be put in adrawer to be considered later, ignored, or discarded."

Id.,at 475-476. We pointed out that "[t]he relevant inquiry is

not whether there exist potential clients whose `condition'makes them susceptible to undue influence, but whether the
mode of communication poses a serious danger that lawyerswill exploit any such susceptibility."

Id., at 474. In assess-ing the substantiality of the evils to be prevented, we concluded that "the mode of communication makes all the differ-ence." Id., at 475. The direct mail in Shapero did not
present the justification for regulation of speech presentedin Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Assn., 436 U. S. 447 (1978) (a

515us2$86l 08-17-98 13:33:22 PAGES OPINPGT

Kennedy, J., dissenting
lawyer's direct, in-person solicitation of personal injury busi-ness may be prohibited by the State). See also

Edenfield,
supra (an accountant's direct, in-person solicitation of ac-counting business did implicate a privacy interest, though

not one permitting state suppression of speech when other
factors were considered).To avoid the controlling effect of

Shapero in the case before us, the Court seeks to declare that a different privacyinterest is implicated. As it sees the matter, the substantial

concern is that victims or their families will be offended byreceiving a solicitation during their grief and trauma. But
we do not allow restrictions on speech to be justified on the
ground that the expression might offend the listener. On
the contrary, we have said that these "are classically not justifications validating the suppression of expression protected
by the First Amendment." Carey v. Population Services
Int'l, 431 U. S. 678, 701 (1977). And in Zauderer v. Office of
Disciplinary Counsel of Supreme Court of Ohio, 471 U. S.
626 (1985), where we struck down a ban on attorney advertising, we held that "the mere possibility that some members
of the population might find advertising . . . offensive cannot
justify suppressing it. The same must hold true for advertising that some members of the bar might find beneath their
dignity." Id., at 648.

We have applied this principle to direct-mail cases as well
as with respect to general advertising, noting that the right
to use the mails is protected by the First Amendment. See
Bolger v. Youngs Drug Products Corp., 463 U. S. 60, 76
(1983) (Rehnquist, J., concurring) (citing Blount v. Rizzi,
400 U. S. 410 (1971)). In Bolger, we held that a statute designed to "shiel[d] recipients of mail from materials that they
are likely to find offensive" furthered an interest of "little
weight," noting that "we have consistently held that the fact
that protected speech may be offensive to some does not justify its suppression." 463 U. S., at 71 (citing Carey, supra,
at 701). It is only where an audience is captive that we will

515us2$86l 08-17-98 13:33:22 PAGES OPINPGT

639Cite as: 515 U. S. 618 (1995)
Kennedy, J., dissenting
assure its protection from some offensive speech. See Consolidated Edison Co. of N. Y. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of
N. Y., 447 U. S. 530, 542 (1980). Outside that context, "wehave never held that the Government itself can shut off the

flow of mailings to protect those recipients who might potentially be offended." Bolger, supra, at 72. The occupants ofa household receiving mailings are not a captive audience,

463 U. S., at 72, and the asserted interest in preventing theiroffense should be no more controlling here than in our prior
cases. All the recipient of objectional mailings need do is totake "the `short, though regular, journey from mail box to
trash can.' " Ibid. (citation omitted). As we have observed,
this is "an acceptable burden, at least so far as the Constitution is concerned." Ibid. If these cases forbidding restrictions on speech that might be offensive are to be overruled,
the Court should say so.

In the face of these difficulties of logic and precedent, the
State and the opinion of the Court turn to a second interest:
protecting the reputation and dignity of the legal profession.
The argument is, it seems fair to say, that all are demeaned
by the crass behavior of a few. The argument takes a further step in the amicus brief filed by the Association of Trial
Lawyers of America. There it is said that disrespect for the
profession from this sort of solicitation (but presumably from
no other sort of solicitation) results in lower jury verdicts.
In a sense, of course, these arguments are circular. While
disrespect will arise from an unethical or improper practice,
the majority begs a most critical question by assuming that
direct-mail solicitations constitute such a practice. The fact
is, however, that direct solicitation may serve vital purposes
and promote the administration of justice, and to the extent
the bar seeks to protect lawyers' reputations by preventing
them from engaging in speech some deem offensive, the
State is doing nothing more (as amicus the Association of
Trial Lawyers of America is at least candid enough to admit)
than manipulating the public's opinion by suppressing speech

640 FLORIDA BAR v. WENT FOR IT, INC.

Kennedy, J., dissenting
that informs us how the legal system works. The disrespectargument thus proceeds from the very assumption it tries to

prove, which is to say that solicitations within 30 days serveno legitimate purpose. This, of course, is censorship pure
and simple; and censorship is antithetical to the first princi-ples of free expression.

II
Even were the interests asserted substantial, the regula-tion here fails the second part of the

Central Hudson test,which requires that the dangers the State seeks to eliminate

be real and that a speech restriction or ban advance thatasserted state interest in a direct and material way.

Eden-field, 507 U. S., at 771. The burden of demonstrating the

reality of the asserted harm rests on the State. Ibid.Slight evidence in this regard does not mean there is sufficient evidence to support the claims. Here, what the Statehas offered falls well short of demonstrating that the harms
it is trying to redress are real, let alone that the regulationdirectly and materially advances the State's interests. The
parties and the Court have used the term "Summary of Rec-ord" to describe a document prepared by the Florida Bar
(Bar), one of the adverse parties, and submitted to the Dis-trict Court in this case. See

ante, at 626. This documentincludes no actual surveys, few indications of sample size or

selection procedures, no explanations of methodology, and nodiscussion of excluded results. There is no description of
the statistical universe or scientific framework that permitsany productive use of the information the so-called Summary
of Record contains. The majority describes this anecdotalmatter as "noteworthy for its breadth and detail,"

ante, at627, but when examined, it is noteworthy for its incompetence. The selective synopses of unvalidated studies deal,for the most part, with television advertising and phone book
listings, and not direct-mail solicitations. Although theremay be issues common to various kinds of attorney advertising and solicitation, it is not clear what would follow from

641Cite as: 515 U. S. 618 (1995)
Kennedy, J., dissenting
that limited premise, unless the Court means by its decisionto call into question all forms of attorney advertising. The

most generous reading of this document permits identifica-tion of 34 pages on which direct-mail solicitation is arguably
discussed. Of these, only two are even a synopsis of a studyof the attitudes of Floridians towards such solicitations.
The bulk of the remaining pages include comments by law-yers about direct mail (some of them favorable), excerpts
from citizen complaints about such solicitation, and a few ex-cerpts from newspaper articles on the topic. Our cases require something more than a few pages of self-serving andunsupported statements by the State to demonstrate that a
regulation directly and materially advances the eliminationof a real harm when the State seeks to suppress truthful and
nondeceptive speech. See, e. g., Edenfield, 507 U. S., at771-772.

It is telling that the essential thrust of all the materialadduced to justify the State's interest is devoted to the reputational concerns of the Bar. It is not at all clear that thisregulation advances the interest of protecting persons who
are suffering trauma and grief, and we are cited to no mate-rial in the record for that claim. Indeed, when asked at oral
argument what a "typical injured plaintiff get[s] in the mail,"the Bar's lawyer replied: "That's not in the record. . . and I
don't know the answer to that question." Tr. of Oral Arg.25. Having declared that the privacy interest is one both
substantial and served by the regulation, the Court oughtnot to be excused from justifying its conclusion.

III
The insufficiency of the regulation to advance the State'sinterest is reinforced by the third inquiry necessary in this

analysis. Were it appropriate to reach the third part of theCentral Hudson test, it would be clear that the relationship
between the Bar's interests and the means chosen to servethem is not a reasonable fit. The Bar's rule creates a flat

Kennedy, J., dissenting
ban that prohibits far more speech than necessary to servethe purported state interest. Even assuming that interest

were legitimate, there is a wild disproportion between theharm supposed and the speech ban enforced. It is a disproportion the Court does not bother to discuss, but our speech
jurisprudence requires that it do so. Central Hudson, 447U. S., at 569-571;

Board of Trustees of State Univ. of N. Y.
v. Fox, 492 U. S. 469, 480 (1989).To begin with, the ban applies with respect to all accidental injuries, whatever their gravity. The Court's purportedjustification for the excess of regulation in this respect is the
difficulty of drawing lines between severe and less serious
injuries, see ante, at 633, but making such distinctions is not
important in this analysis. Even were it significant, the
Court's assertion is unconvincing. After all, the criminal
law routinely distinguishes degrees of bodily harm, see, e. g.,
United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual

$ 1B1.1, comment., n. 1(b), (h), ( j) (Nov. 1994), and if that delineation is permissible and workable in the criminal context,
it should not be "hard to imagine the contours of a regulation" that satisfies the reasonable fit requirement. Ante, at
633.

There is, moreover, simply no justification for assuming
that in all or most cases an attorney's advice would be unwelcome or unnecessary when the survivors or the victim must
at once begin assessing their legal and financial position in a
rational manner. With regard to lesser injuries, there is little chance that for any period, much less 30 days, the victims
will become distraught upon hearing from an attorney. It
is, in fact, more likely a real risk that some victims might
think no attorney will be interested enough to help them.
It is at this precise time that sound legal advice may be necessary and most urgent.

Even as to more serious injuries, the State's argument
fails, since it must be conceded that prompt legal representation is essential where death or injury results from accidents.

Kennedy, J., dissenting
The only seeming justification for the State's restriction isthe one the Court itself offers, which is that attorneys can

and do resort to other ways of communicating importantlegal information to potential clients. Quite aside from the
latent protectionism for the established bar that the argument discloses, it fails for the more fundamental reason thatit concedes the necessity for the very representation the attorneys solicit and the State seeks to ban. The accident vic-tims who are prejudiced to vindicate the State's purported
desire for more dignity in the legal profession will be thevery persons who most need legal advice, for they are the
victims who, because they lack education, linguistic ability,
or familiarity with the legal system, are unable to seek out
legal services. Cf. Trainmen v. Virginia ex rel. Virginia
State Bar, 377 U. S. 1, 3-4 (1964).

The reasonableness of the State's chosen methods for redressing perceived evils can be evaluated, in part, by a commonsense consideration of other possible means of regulation
that have not been tried. Here, the Court neglects the fact
that this problem is largely self-policing: Potential clients
will not hire lawyers who offend them. And even if a person
enters into a contract with an attorney and later regrets it,
Florida, like some other States, allows clients to rescind certain contracts with attorneys within a stated time after they
are executed. See, e. g., Rules Regulating the Florida Bar,
Rule 4-1.5 (Statement of Client's Rights) (effective Jan. 1,
1993). The State's restriction deprives accident victims of
information which may be critical to their right to make a
claim for compensation for injuries. The telephone book and
general advertisements may serve this purpose in part; but
the direct solicitation ban will fall on those who most need
legal representation: for those with minor injuries, the victims too ill informed to know an attorney may be interested
in their cases; for those with serious injuries, the victims too
ill informed to know that time is of the essence if counsel is
to assemble evidence and warn them not to enter into settle515us2$86l 08-17-98 13:33:23 PAGES OPINPGT

ment negotiations or evidentiary discussions with investiga-tors for opposing parties. One survey reports that over a

recent 5-year period, 68% of the American population con-sulted a lawyer. N. Y. Times, June 11, 1995, section 3, p. 1,
col. 1. The use of modern communication methods in atimely way is essential if clients who make up this vast demand are to be advised and informed of all of their choicesand rights in selecting an attorney. The very fact that some
280,000 direct-mail solicitations are sent to accident victimsand their survivors in Florida each year is some indication
of the efficacy of this device. Nothing in the Court's opiniondemonstrates that these efforts do not serve some beneficial
role. A solicitation letter is not a contract. Nothing in therecord shows that these communications do not at the least
serve the purpose of informing the prospective client that heor she has a number of different attorneys from whom to
choose, so that the decision to select counsel, after an inter-view with one or more interested attorneys, can be deliberate and informed. And if these communications reveal thesocial costs of the tort system as a whole, then efforts can be
directed to reforming the operation of that system, not tosuppressing information about how the system works. The
Court's approach, however, does not seem to be the properway to begin elevating the honor of the profession.

IV
It is most ironic that, for the first time since Bates v. State
Bar of Arizona, the Court now orders a major retreat fromthe constitutional guarantees for commercial speech in order

to shield its own profession from public criticism. Obscur-ing the financial aspect of the legal profession from public
discussion through direct-mail solicitation, at the expense ofthe least sophisticated members of society, is not a laudable
constitutional goal. There is no authority for the proposi-tion that the Constitution permits the State to promote the
public image of the legal profession by suppressing informa515us2$86l 08-17-98 13:33:23 PAGES OPINPGT

tion about the profession's business aspects. If public re-spect for the profession erodes because solicitation distorts

the idea of the law as most lawyers see it, it must be remem-bered that real progress begins with more rational speech,
not less. I agree that if this amounts to mere "sermoniz-ing," see

Shapero, 486 U. S., at 490 (O'Connor, J., dissent-ing), the attempt may be futile. The guiding principle, however, is that full and rational discussion furthers soundregulation and necessary reform. The image of the profession cannot be enhanced without improving the substance ofits practice. The objective of the profession is to ensure
that "the ethical standards of lawyers are linked to the serv-ice and protection of clients."

Ohralik, 436 U. S., at 461.Today's opinion is a serious departure, not only from our

prior decisions involving attorney advertising, but also fromthe principles that govern the transmission of commercial
speech. The Court's opinion reflects a new-found and ille-gitimate confidence that it, along with the Supreme Court
of Florida, knows what is best for the Bar and its clients.Self-assurance has always been the hallmark of a censor.
That is why under the First Amendment the public, not theState, has the right and the power to decide what ideas and
information are deserving of their adherence. "[T]he gen-eral rule is that the speaker and the audience, not the government, assess the value of the information presented."
Edenfield, 507 U. S., at 767. By validating Florida's rule,today's majority is complicit in the Bar's censorship. For

these reasons, I dissent from the opinion of the Court andfrom its judgment.

VERNONIA SCHOOL DISTRICT 47J v. ACTON

et ux., guardians ad litem for ACTON

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 94-590. Argued March 28, 1995--Decided June 26, 1995
Motivated by the discovery that athletes were leaders in the student drug

culture and concern that drug use increases the risk of sports-related
injury, petitioner school district (District) adopted the Student Athlete
Drug Policy (Policy), which authorizes random urinalysis drug testing
of students who participate in its athletics programs. Respondent
Acton was denied participation in his school's football program when he
and his parents (also respondents) refused to consent to the testing.
They then filed this suit, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief on
the grounds that the Policy violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments and the Oregon Constitution. The District Court denied the
claims, but the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the Policy violated both the Federal and State Constitutions.

Held: The Policy is constitutional under the Fourth and Fourteenth

Amendments. Pp. 652-666.

(a) State-compelled collection and testing of urine constitutes a
"search" under the Fourth Amendment. Skinner v. Railway Labor
Executives' Assn., 489 U. S. 602, 617. Where there was no clear practice, either approving or disapproving the type of search at issue, at the
time the constitutional provision was enacted, the "reasonableness" of a
search is judged by balancing the intrusion on the individual's Fourth
Amendment interests against the promotion of legitimate governmental
interests. Pp. 652-654.

(b) The first factor to be considered in determining reasonableness is
the nature of the privacy interest on which the search intrudes. Here,
the subjects of the Policy are children who have been committed to the
temporary custody of the State as schoolmaster; in that capacity, the
State may exercise a degree of supervision and control greater than it
could exercise over free adults. The requirements that public school
children submit to physical examinations and be vaccinated indicate that
they have a lesser privacy expectation with regard to medical examinations and procedures than the general population. Student athletes
have even less of a legitimate privacy expectation, for an element of
communal undress is inherent in athletic participation, and athletes are

Syllabus
subject to preseason physical exams and rules regulating their conduct. Pp. 654-657.

(c) The privacy interests compromised by the process of obtaining
urine samples under the Policy are negligible, since the conditions of
collection are nearly identical to those typically encountered in public
restrooms. In addition, the tests look only for standard drugs, not
medical conditions, and the results are released to a limited group.
Pp. 658-660.

(d) The nature and immediacy of the governmental concern at issue,
and the efficacy of this means for meeting it, also favor a finding of
reasonableness. The importance of deterring drug use by all this
Nation's schoolchildren cannot be doubted. Moreover, the Policy is directed more narrowly to drug use by athletes, where the risk of physical
harm to the user and other players is high. The District Court's conclusion that the District's concerns were immediate is not clearly erroneous, and it is self-evident that a drug problem largely caused by athletes,
and of particular danger to athletes, is effectively addressed by ensuring
that athletes do not use drugs. The Fourth Amendment does not require that the "least intrusive" search be conducted, so respondents'
argument that the drug testing could be based on suspicion of drug use,
if true, would not be fatal; and that alternative entails its own substantial difficulties. Pp. 660-664.

The Student Athlete Drug Policy adopted by School Dis-trict 47J in the town of Vernonia, Oregon, authorizes random

to decide whether this violates the Fourth and FourteenthAmendments to the United States Constitution.

A
Petitioner Vernonia School District 47J (District) operatesone high school and three grade schools in the logging community of Vernonia, Oregon. As elsewhere in small-townAmerica, school sports play a prominent role in the town's
life, and student athletes are admired in their schools and inthe community.

Drugs had not been a major problem in Vernonia schools.In the mid-to-late 1980's, however, teachers and administrators observed a sharp increase in drug use. Students beganto speak out about their attraction to the drug culture, and
to boast that there was nothing the school could do about it.Along with more drugs came more disciplinary problems.

Opinion of the Court
Between 1988 and 1989 the number of disciplinary referralsin Vernonia schools rose to more than twice the number

reported in the early 1980's, and several students weresuspended. Students became increasingly rude during
class; outbursts of profane language became common.

Not only were student athletes included among the drugusers but, as the District Court found, athletes were the

leaders of the drug culture. 796 F. Supp. 1354, 1357 (Ore.1992). This caused the District's administrators particular
concern, since drug use increases the risk of sports-relatedinjury. Expert testimony at the trial confirmed the deleterious effects of drugs on motivation, memory, judgment, re-action, coordination, and performance. The high school football and wrestling coach witnessed a severe sternum injury
suffered by a wrestler, and various omissions of safety proce-dures and misexecutions by football players, all attributable

in his belief to the effects of drug use.Initially, the District responded to the drug problem by
offering special classes, speakers, and presentations de-signed to deter drug use. It even brought in a specially
trained dog to detect drugs, but the drug problem persisted.According to the District Court:

"[T]he administration was at its wits end and . . . a largesegment of the student body, particularly those involved
in interscholastic athletics, was in a state of rebellion.Disciplinary actions had reached `epidemic proportions.'
The coincidence of an almost three-fold increase in classroom disruptions and disciplinary reports along with thestaff 's direct observations of students using drugs or

glamorizing drug and alcohol use led the administration
to the inescapable conclusion that the rebellion was
being fueled by alcohol and drug abuse as well as the
student's misperceptions about the drug culture." Ibid.

At that point, District officials began considering a drugtesting program. They held a parent "input night" to dis515us3$87K 08-12-98 17:56:25 PAGES OPINPGT
650 VERNONIA SCHOOL DIST. 47J v. ACTON

Opinion of the Court
cuss the proposed Student Athlete Drug Policy (Policy), andthe parents in attendance gave their unanimous approval.

The school board approved the Policy for implementation inthe fall of 1989. Its expressed purpose is to prevent student
athletes from using drugs, to protect their health and safety,and to provide drug users with assistance programs.

B
The Policy applies to all students participating in inter-scholastic athletics. Students wishing to play sports must

sign a form consenting to the testing and must obtain thewritten consent of their parents. Athletes are tested at the
beginning of the season for their sport. In addition, onceeach week of the season the names of the athletes are placed
in a "pool" from which a student, with the supervision of twoadults, blindly draws the names of 10% of the athletes for
random testing. Those selected are notified and tested thatsame day, if possible.

The student to be tested completes a specimen controlform which bears an assigned number. Prescription medications that the student is taking must be identified by pro-viding a copy of the prescription or a doctor's authorization.
The student then enters an empty locker room accompaniedby an adult monitor of the same sex. Each boy selected
produces a sample at a urinal, remaining fully clothed withhis back to the monitor, who stands approximately 12 to 15
feet behind the student. Monitors may (though do not al-ways) watch the student while he produces the sample, and
they listen for normal sounds of urination. Girls producesamples in an enclosed bathroom stall, so that they can be
heard but not observed. After the sample is produced, itis given to the monitor, who checks it for temperature and
tampering and then transfers it to a vial.The samples are sent to an independent laboratory, which
routinely tests them for amphetamines, cocaine, and mari-juana. Other drugs, such as LSD, may be screened at the

Opinion of the Court
request of the District, but the identity of a particular stu-dent does not determine which drugs will be tested. The

laboratory's procedures are 99.94% accurate. The Districtfollows strict procedures regarding the chain of custody and
access to test results. The laboratory does not know theidentity of the students whose samples it tests. It is authorized to mail written test reports only to the superintendentand to provide test results to District personnel by telephone
only after the requesting official recites a code confirminghis authority. Only the superintendent, principals, viceprincipals, and athletic directors have access to test results,and the results are not kept for more than one year.

If a sample tests positive, a second test is administered assoon as possible to confirm the result. If the second test is
negative, no further action is taken. If the second test ispositive, the athlete's parents are notified, and the school
principal convenes a meeting with the student and his par-ents, at which the student is given the option of (1) participating for six weeks in an assistance program that includesweekly urinalysis, or (2) suffering suspension from athletics
for the remainder of the current season and the next athleticseason. The student is then retested prior to the start of
the next athletic season for which he or she is eligible. ThePolicy states that a second offense results in automatic imposition of option (2); a third offense in suspension for theremainder of the current season and the next two athletic
seasons. C

In the fall of 1991, respondent James Acton, then a seventhgrader, signed up to play football at one of the District's
grade schools. He was denied participation, however, be-cause he and his parents refused to sign the testing consent
forms. The Actons filed suit, seeking declaratory and in-junctive relief from enforcement of the Policy on the grounds
that it violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments tothe United States Constitution and Article I, $ 9, of the Ore515us3$87K 08-12-98 17:56:25 PAGES OPINPGT

gon Constitution. After a bench trial, the District Courtentered an order denying the claims on the merits and

dismissing the action. 796 F. Supp., at 1355. The UnitedStates Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that the Policy violated both the Fourth and FourteenthAmendments and Article I, $ 9, of the Oregon Constitution.
23 F. 3d 1514 (1994). We granted certiorari. 513 U. S.1013 (1994).

II
The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitutionprovides that the Federal Government shall not violate "[t]he

right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses,papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and
seizures . . . ." We have held that the Fourteenth Amend-ment extends this constitutional guarantee to searches and
seizures by state officers, Elkins v. United States, 364 U. S.206, 213 (1960), including public school officials,

New Jerseyv. T. L. O., 469 U. S. 325, 336-337 (1985). In Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives' Assn., 489 U. S. 602, 617 (1989), weheld that state-compelled collection and testing of urine, such
as that required by the Policy, constitutes a "search" subjectto the demands of the Fourth Amendment. See also Treasury Employees v. Von Raab, 489 U. S. 656, 665 (1989).As the text of the Fourth Amendment indicates, the ultimate measure of the constitutionality of a governmentalsearch is "reasonableness." At least in a case such as this,
where there was no clear practice, either approving or disap-proving the type of search at issue, at the time the constitutional provision was enacted,1 whether a particular searchmeets the reasonableness standard " `is judged by balancing

1 Not until 1852 did Massachusetts, the pioneer in the "common school"
movement, enact a compulsory school-attendance law, and as late as the
1870's only 14 States had such laws. R. Butts, Public Education in the
United States From Revolution to Reform 102-103 (1978); 1 Children and
Youth in America 467-468 (R. Bremner ed. 1970). The drug problem, and
the technology of drug testing, are of course even more recent.

Opinion of the Court
its intrusion on the individual's Fourth Amendment interestsagainst its promotion of legitimate governmental interests.' "

Skinner, supra, at 619 (quoting Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U. S.648, 654 (1979)). Where a search is undertaken by law
enforcement officials to discover evidence of criminal wrongdoing, this Court has said that reasonableness generallyrequires the obtaining of a judicial warrant,

Skinner, supra,
at 619. Warrants cannot be issued, of course, without theshowing of probable cause required by the Warrant Clause.

But a warrant is not required to establish the reasonablenessof

all government searches; and when a warrant is not required (and the Warrant Clause therefore not applicable),
probable cause is not invariably required either. A search
unsupported by probable cause can be constitutional, we
have said, "when special needs, beyond the normal need for
law enforcement, make the warrant and probable-cause requirement impracticable." Griffin v. Wisconsin, 483 U. S.
868, 873 (1987) (internal quotation marks omitted).

We have found such "special needs" to exist in the public
school context. There, the warrant requirement "would unduly interfere with the maintenance of the swift and informal disciplinary procedures [that are] needed," and "strict
adherence to the requirement that searches be based on
probable cause" would undercut "the substantial need of
teachers and administrators for freedom to maintain order
in the schools." T. L. O., 469 U. S., at 340, 341. The school
search we approved in T. L. O., while not based on probable
cause, was based on individualized suspicion of wrongdoing.
As we explicitly acknowledged, however, " `the Fourth
Amendment imposes no irreducible requirement of such suspicion,' " id., at 342, n. 8 (quoting United States v. MartinezFuerte, 428 U. S. 543, 560-561 (1976)). We have upheld suspicionless searches and seizures to conduct drug testing of
railroad personnel involved in train accidents, see Skinner,
supra; to conduct random drug testing of federal customs
officers who carry arms or are involved in drug interdiction,

see Von Raab, supra; and to maintain automobile check-points looking for illegal immigrants and contraband,

Martinez-Fuerte, supra, and drunk drivers, Michigan Dept.of State Police v. Sitz, 496 U. S. 444 (1990).

III
The first factor to be considered is the nature of the pri-vacy interest upon which the search here at issue intrudes.

The Fourth Amendment does not protect all subjective ex-pectations of privacy, but only those that society recognizes
as "legitimate." T. L. O., 469 U. S., at 338. What expecta-tions are legitimate varies, of course, with context,

id., at337, depending, for example, upon whether the individual asserting the privacy interest is at home, at work, in a car, or ina public park. In addition, the legitimacy of certain privacy
expectations vis-a` -vis the State may depend upon the indi-vidual's legal relationship with the State. For example, in
Griffin, supra, we held that, although a "probationer's home,like anyone else's, is protected by the Fourth Amendmen[t],"
the supervisory relationship between probationer and Statejustifies "a degree of impingement upon [a probationer's] privacy that would not be constitutional if applied to the publicat large." 483 U. S., at 873, 875. Central, in our view, to
the present case is the fact that the subjects of the Policy are(1) children, who (2) have been committed to the temporary
custody of the State as schoolmaster.Traditionally at common law, and still today, unemancipated minors lack some of the most fundamental rights ofself-determination--including even the right of liberty in its
narrow sense, i. e., the right to come and go at will. Theyare subject, even as to their physical freedom, to the control
of their parents or guardians. See 59 Am. Jur. 2d, Parentand Child $ 10 (1987). When parents place minor children
in private schools for their education, the teachers and ad-ministrators of those schools stand

in loco parentis over thechildren entrusted to them. In fact, the tutor or schoolmas515us3$87K 08-12-98 17:56:25 PAGES OPINPGT

655Cite as: 515 U. S. 646 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
ter is the very prototype of that status. As Blackstone de-scribes it, a parent "may . . . delegate part of his parental

authority, during his life, to the tutor or schoolmaster of hischild; who is then

in loco parentis, and has such a portion of
the power of the parent committed to his charge, viz. that of
restraint and correction, as may be necessary to answer thepurposes for which he is employed." 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 441 (1769).In

T. L. O. we rejected the notion that public schools, like
private schools, exercise only parental power over their stu-dents, which of course is not subject to constitutional constraints. 469 U. S., at 336. Such a view of things, we said,
"is not entirely `consonant with compulsory education laws,' "
ibid. (quoting Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U. S. 651, 662 (1977)),
and is inconsistent with our prior decisions treating school
officials as state actors for purposes of the Due Process and
Free Speech Clauses, T. L. O., supra, at 336. But while denying that the State's power over schoolchildren is formally
no more than the delegated power of their parents, T. L. O.
did not deny, but indeed emphasized, that the nature of that
power is custodial and tutelary, permitting a degree of supervision and control that could not be exercised over free
adults. "[A] proper educational environment requires close
supervision of schoolchildren, as well as the enforcement of
rules against conduct that would be perfectly permissible if
undertaken by an adult." 469 U. S., at 339. While we do
not, of course, suggest that public schools as a general matter
have such a degree of control over children as to give rise to
a constitutional "duty to protect," see DeShaney v. Winnebago County Dept. of Social Servs., 489 U. S. 189, 200 (1989),
we have acknowledged that for many purposes "school authorities ac[t] in loco parentis," Bethel School Dist. No. 403
v. Fraser, 478 U. S. 675, 684 (1986), with the power and indeed the duty to "inculcate the habits and manners of civility," id., at 681 (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus,

Independent Community School Dist., 393 U. S. 503, 506

e. g., Goss v. Lopez, 419 U. S. 565,

after it has occurred"); Fraser, supra, at 683 ("[I]t is a highlyappropriate function of public school education to prohibit
the use of vulgar and offensive terms in public discourse");

publications, so long as the censorship is "reasonably related
to legitimate pedagogical concerns"); Ingraham, supra, at
682 ("Imposing additional administrative safeguards [upon
corporal punishment] . . . would . . . entail a significant intrusion into an area of primary educational responsibility").

Fourth Amendment rights, no less than First and Fourteenth Amendment rights, are different in public schools
than elsewhere; the "reasonableness" inquiry cannot disregard the schools' custodial and tutelary responsibility for
children. For their own good and that of their classmates,
public school children are routinely required to submit to
various physical examinations, and to be vaccinated against
various diseases. According to the American Academy of
Pediatrics, most public schools "provide vision and hearing
screening and dental and dermatological checks. . . . Others
also mandate scoliosis screening at appropriate grade levels." Committee on School Health, American Academy of
Pediatrics, School Health: A Guide for Health Professionals
2 (1987). In the 1991-1992 school year, all 50 States required public school students to be vaccinated against diphtheria, measles, rubella, and polio. U. S. Dept. of Health &
Human Services, Public Health Service, Centers for Disease
Control, State Immunization Requirements 1991-1992, p. 1.

Opinion of the Court
dures, therefore, "students within the school environment
have a lesser expectation of privacy than members of the
population generally." T. L. O., supra, at 348 (Powell, J.,
concurring).

Legitimate privacy expectations are even less with regard
to student athletes. School sports are not for the bashful.
They require "suiting up" before each practice or event, and
showering and changing afterwards. Public school locker
rooms, the usual sites for these activities, are not notable for
the privacy they afford. The locker rooms in Vernonia are
typical: No individual dressing rooms are provided; shower
heads are lined up along a wall, unseparated by any sort of
partition or curtain; not even all the toilet stalls have doors.
As the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit has noted, there is "an element of `communal undress'
inherent in athletic participation," Schaill by Kross v. Tippecanoe County School Corp., 864 F. 2d 1309, 1318 (1988).

There is an additional respect in which school athletes
have a reduced expectation of privacy. By choosing to "go
out for the team," they voluntarily subject themselves to a
degree of regulation even higher than that imposed on students generally. In Vernonia's public schools, they must
submit to a preseason physical exam (James testified that his
included the giving of a urine sample, App. 17), they must
acquire adequate insurance coverage or sign an insurance
waiver, maintain a minimum grade point average, and comply with any "rules of conduct, dress, training hours and related matters as may be established for each sport by the
head coach and athletic director with the principal's approval." Record, Exh. 2, p. 30, || 8. Somewhat like adults
who choose to participate in a "closely regulated industry,"
students who voluntarily participate in school athletics have
reason to expect intrusions upon normal rights and privileges, including privacy. See Skinner, 489 U. S., at 627;
United States v. Biswell, 406 U. S. 311, 316 (1972).

Opinion of the Court

IV
Having considered the scope of the legitimate expectationof privacy at issue here, we turn next to the character of the

intrusion that is complained of. We recognized in Skinnerthat collecting the samples for urinalysis intrudes upon "an
excretory function traditionally shielded by great privacy."489 U. S., at 626. We noted, however, that the degree of
intrusion depends upon the manner in which production ofthe urine sample is monitored. Ibid. Under the District's
Policy, male students produce samples at a urinal along awall. They remain fully clothed and are only observed from
behind, if at all. Female students produce samples in anenclosed stall, with a female monitor standing outside listening only for sounds of tampering. These conditions arenearly identical to those typically encountered in public restrooms, which men, women, and especially schoolchildren usedaily. Under such conditions, the privacy interests compromised by the process of obtaining the urine sample are inour view negligible.

The other privacy-invasive aspect of urinalysis is, ofcourse, the information it discloses concerning the state of
the subject's body, and the materials he has ingested. Inthis regard it is significant that the tests at issue here look
only for drugs, and not for whether the student is, for exam-ple, epileptic, pregnant, or diabetic. See id., at 617. Moreover, the drugs for which the samples are screened arestandard, and do not vary according to the identity of the
student. And finally, the results of the tests are disclosedonly to a limited class of school personnel who have a need
to know; and they are not turned over to law enforcementauthorities or used for any internal disciplinary function.
796 F. Supp., at 1364; see also 23 F. 3d, at 1521.2

2 Despite the fact that, like routine school physicals and vaccinations--
which the dissent apparently finds unobjectionable even though they "are
both blanket searches of a sort," post, at 682--the search here is undertaken for prophylactic and distinctly nonpunitive purposes (protecting

659Cite as: 515 U. S. 646 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
Respondents argue, however, that the District's Policy is
in fact more intrusive than this suggests, because it requires
the students, if they are to avoid sanctions for a falsely positive test, to identify in advance prescription medications
they are taking. We agree that this raises some cause for
concern. In Von Raab, we flagged as one of the salutary
features of the Customs Service drug-testing program the
fact that employees were not required to disclose medical
information unless they tested positive, and, even then, the
information was supplied to a licensed physician rather than
to the Government employer. See Von Raab, 489 U. S., at
672-673, n. 2. On the other hand, we have never indicated
that requiring advance disclosure of medications is per se
unreasonable. Indeed, in Skinner we held that it was not
"a significant invasion of privacy." 489 U. S., at 626, n. 7.
It can be argued that, in Skinner, the disclosure went only
to the medical personnel taking the sample, and the Government personnel analyzing it, see id., at 609, but see id., at
610 (railroad personnel responsible for forwarding the sample, and presumably accompanying information, to the Government's testing lab); and that disclosure to teachers and
coaches--to persons who personally know the student--is a
greater invasion of privacy. Assuming for the sake of argustudent athletes from injury, and deterring drug use in the student population), see 796 F. Supp., at 1363, the dissent would nonetheless lump this
search together with "evidentiary" searches, which generally require
probable cause, see supra, at 653, because, from the student's perspective,
the test may be "regarded" or "understood" as punishment, post, at 683-
684. In light of the District Court's findings regarding the purposes and
consequences of the testing, any such perception is by definition an irrational one, which is protected nowhere else in the law. In any event, our
point is not, as the dissent apparently believes, post, at 682-683, that since
student vaccinations and physical exams are constitutionally reasonable,
student drug testing must be so as well; but rather that, by reason of
those prevalent practices, public school children in general, and student
athletes in particular, have a diminished expectation of privacy. See
supra, at 656-657.

660 VERNONIA SCHOOL DIST. 47J v. ACTON

Opinion of the Court
ment that both those propositions are true, we do not believethey establish a difference that respondents are entitled to

rely on here.The General Authorization Form that respondents refused
to sign, which refusal was the basis for James's exclusionfrom the sports program, said only (in relevant part): "I . . .
authorize the Vernonia School District to conduct a test ona urine specimen which I provide to test for drugs and/or
alcohol use. I also authorize the release of information con-cerning the results of such a test to the Vernonia School District and to the parents and/or guardians of the student."App. 10-11. While the practice of the District seems to
have been to have a school official take medication informa-tion from the student at the time of the test, see id., at 29,
42, that practice is not set forth in, or required by, the Policy,which says simply: "Student athletes who . . . are or have
been taking prescription medication must provide verifica-tion (either by a copy of the prescription or by doctor's authorization) prior to being tested." Id., at 8. It may wellbe that, if and when James was selected for random testing
at a time that he was taking medication, the School Districtwould have permitted him to provide the requested information in a confidential manner--for example, in a sealedenvelope delivered to the testing lab. Nothing in the Policy
contradicts that, and when respondents choose, in effect,to challenge the Policy on its face, we will not assume
the worst. Accordingly, we reach the same conclusion asin Skinner: that the invasion of privacy was not significant.

V
Finally, we turn to consider the nature and immediacy ofthe governmental concern at issue here, and the efficacy of

this means for meeting it. In both Skinner and Von Raab,we characterized the government interest motivating the
search as "compelling." Skinner, supra, at 628 (interest inpreventing railway accidents); Von Raab, supra, at 670 (in515us3$87K 08-12-98 17:56:25 PAGES OPINPGT

661Cite as: 515 U. S. 646 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
terest in ensuring fitness of customs officials to interdictdrugs and handle firearms). Relying on these cases, the

District Court held that because the District's program alsocalled for drug testing in the absence of individualized suspicion, the District "must demonstrate a `compelling need' for
the program." 796 F. Supp., at 1363. The Court of Appealsappears to have agreed with this view. See 23 F. 3d, at

1526. It is a mistake, however, to think that the phrase"compelling state interest," in the Fourth Amendment context, describes a fixed, minimum quantum of governmentalconcern, so that one can dispose of a case by answering in
isolation the question: Is there a compelling state interest
here? Rather, the phrase describes an interest that appears
important enough to justify the particular search at hand, in
light of other factors that show the search to be relatively
intrusive upon a genuine expectation of privacy. Whether
that relatively high degree of government concern is necessary in this case or not, we think it is met.

That the nature of the concern is important--indeed, perhaps compelling--can hardly be doubted. Deterring drug
use by our Nation's schoolchildren is at least as important as
enhancing efficient enforcement of the Nation's laws against
the importation of drugs, which was the governmental concern in Von Raab, supra, at 668, or deterring drug use by
engineers and trainmen, which was the governmental concern in Skinner, supra, at 628. School years are the time
when the physical, psychological, and addictive effects of
drugs are most severe. "Maturing nervous systems are
more critically impaired by intoxicants than mature ones are;
childhood losses in learning are lifelong and profound"; "children grow chemically dependent more quickly than adults,
and their record of recovery is depressingly poor." Hawley,
The Bumpy Road to Drug-Free Schools, 72 Phi Delta Kappan 310, 314 (1990). See also Estroff, Schwartz, & Hoffmann, Adolescent Cocaine Abuse: Addictive Potential, Behavioral and Psychiatric Effects, 28 Clinical Pediatrics 550

Opinion of the Court
(Dec. 1989); Kandel, Davies, Karus, & Yamaguchi, The Con-sequences in Young Adulthood of Adolescent Drug Involvement, 43 Arch. Gen. Psychiatry 746 (Aug. 1986). And ofcourse the effects of a drug-infested school are visited not
just upon the users, but upon the entire student body and
faculty, as the educational process is disrupted. In the pres-ent case, moreover, the necessity for the State to act is magnified by the fact that this evil is being visited not just uponindividuals at large, but upon children for whom it has undertaken a special responsibility of care and direction. Finally,it must not be lost sight of that this program is directed more
narrowly to drug use by school athletes, where the risk of
immediate physical harm to the drug user or those with
whom he is playing his sport is particularly high. Apart
from psychological effects, which include impairment of judgment, slow reaction time, and a lessening of the perception
of pain, the particular drugs screened by the District's Policy
have been demonstrated to pose substantial physical risks
to athletes. Amphetamines produce an "artificially induced
heart rate increase, [p]eripheral vasoconstriction, [b]lood
pressure increase, and [m]asking of the normal fatigue response," making them a "very dangerous drug when used
during exercise of any type." Hawkins, Drugs and Other
Ingesta: Effects on Athletic Performance, in H. Appenzeller,
Managing Sports and Risk Management Strategies 90, 90-91
(1993). Marijuana causes "[i]rregular blood pressure responses during changes in body position," "[r]eduction in the
oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood," and "[i]nhibition of
the normal sweating responses resulting in increased body
temperature." Id., at 94. Cocaine produces "[v]asoconstriction[,] [e]levated blood pressure," and "[p]ossible coronary artery spasms and myocardial infarction." Ibid.

As for the immediacy of the District's concerns: We are
not inclined to question--indeed, we could not possibly find
clearly erroneous--the District Court's conclusion that "a
large segment of the student body, particularly those in515us3$87K 08-12-98 17:56:25 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
volved in interscholastic athletics, was in a state of rebel-lion," that "[d]isciplinary actions had reached `epidemic proportions,' " and that "the rebellion was being fueled byalcohol and drug abuse as well as by the student's misperceptions about the drug culture." 796 F. Supp., at 1357. That
is an immediate crisis of greater proportions than existedin

Skinner, where we upheld the Government's drug-testing
program based on findings of drug use by railroad employeesnationwide, without proof that a problem existed on the particular railroads whose employees were subject to the test.See

Skinner, 489 U. S., at 607. And of much greater proportions than existed in Von Raab, where there was no
documented history of drug use by any customs officials.
See Von Raab, 489 U. S., at 673; id., at 683 (Scalia, J.,
dissenting).

As to the efficacy of this means for addressing the problem: It seems to us self-evident that a drug problem largely
fueled by the "role model" effect of athletes' drug use, and
of particular danger to athletes, is effectively addressed by
making sure that athletes do not use drugs. Respondents
argue that a "less intrusive means to the same end" was
available, namely, "drug testing on suspicion of drug use."
Brief for Respondents 45-46. We have repeatedly refused
to declare that only the "least intrusive" search practicable
can be reasonable under the Fourth Amendment. Skinner,
supra, at 629, n. 9 (collecting cases). Respondents' alternative entails substantial difficulties--if it is indeed practicable
at all. It may be impracticable, for one thing, simply because the parents who are willing to accept random drug
testing for athletes are not willing to accept accusatory drug
testing for all students, which transforms the process into a
badge of shame. Respondents' proposal brings the risk that
teachers will impose testing arbitrarily upon troublesome
but not drug-likely students. It generates the expense of
defending lawsuits that charge such arbitrary imposition, or
that simply demand greater process before accusatory drug

testing is imposed. And not least of all, it adds to the ever-expanding diversionary duties of schoolteachers the new

function of spotting and bringing to account drug abuse, atask for which they are ill prepared, and which is not readily
compatible with their vocation. Cf. Skinner, supra, at 628(quoting 50 Fed. Reg. 31526 (1985)) (a drug impaired individual "will seldom display any outward `signs detectable by thelay person or, in many cases, even the physician' ");

Goss,419 U. S., at 594 (Powell, J., dissenting) ("There is an ongoing

relationship, one in which the teacher must occupy manyroles--educator, adviser, friend, and, at times, parentsubstitute. It is rarely adversary in nature . . .") (footnoteomitted). In many respects, we think, testing based on
"suspicion" of drug use would not be better, but worse.3

VI
Taking into account all the factors we have consideredabove--the decreased expectation of privacy, the relative unobtrusiveness of the search, and the severity of the need met

3 There is no basis for the dissent's insinuation that in upholding the
District's Policy we are equating the Fourth Amendment status of schoolchildren and prisoners, who, the dissent asserts, may have what it calls
the "categorical protection" of a "strong preference for an individualized
suspicion requirement," post, at 681. The case on which it relies for that
proposition, Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U. S. 520 (1979), displays no stronger
a preference for individualized suspicion than we do today. It reiterates the proposition on which we rely, that " `elaborate less-restrictivealternative arguments could raise insuperable barriers to the exercise of
virtually all search-and-seizure powers.' " Id., at 559, n. 40 (quoting
United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U. S. 543, 556-557, n. 12 (1976)).
Even Wolfish's arguendo "assum[ption] that the existence of less intrusive
alternatives is relevant to the determination of the reasonableness of the
particular search method at issue," 441 U. S., at 559, n. 40, does not support
the dissent, for the opinion ultimately rejected the hypothesized alternative (as we do) on the ground that it would impair other policies important
to the institution. See id., at 560, n. 40 (monitoring of visits instead of
conducting body searches would destroy "the confidentiality and intimacy
that these visits are intended to afford").

Opinion of the Court
by the search--we conclude Vernonia's Policy is reasonableand hence constitutional.

We caution against the assumption that suspicionless drugtesting will readily pass constitutional muster in other contexts. The most significant element in this case is the firstwe discussed: that the Policy was undertaken in furtherance
of the government's responsibilities, under a public schoolsystem, as guardian and tutor of children entrusted to its
care.4 Just as when the government conducts a search inits capacity as employer (a warrantless search of an absent
employee's desk to obtain an urgently needed file, for exam-ple), the relevant question is whether that intrusion upon
privacy is one that a reasonable employer might engage in,see

O'Connor v. Ortega, 480 U. S. 709 (1987); so also whenthe government acts as guardian and tutor the relevant

question is whether the search is one that a reasonableguardian and tutor might undertake. Given the findings of
need made by the District Court, we conclude that in thepresent case it is.

We may note that the primary guardians of Vernonia'sschoolchildren appear to agree. The record shows no objection to this districtwide program by any parents other thanthe couple before us here--even though, as we have described, a public meeting was held to obtain parents' views.We find insufficient basis to contradict the judgment of Vernonia's parents, its school board, and the District Court, asto what was reasonably in the interest of these children
under the circumstances.

4 The dissent devotes a few meager paragraphs of its 21 pages to this
central aspect of the testing program, see post, at 680-682, in the course
of which it shows none of the interest in the original meaning of the Fourth
Amendment displayed elsewhere in the opinion, see post, at 669-671. Of
course at the time of the framing, as well as at the time of the adoption of
the Fourteenth Amendment, children had substantially fewer "rights"
than legislatures and courts confer upon them today. See 1 D. Kramer,
Legal Rights of Children $ 1.02, p. 9 (2d ed. 1994); Wald, Children's Rights:

Justice Ginsburg, concurring.
The Court constantly observes that the School District'sdrug-testing policy applies only to students who voluntarily

participate in interscholastic athletics. Ante, at 650, 657 (re-duced privacy expectation and closer school regulation of
student athletes), 662 (drug use by athletes risks immediatephysical harm to users and those with whom they play). Correspondingly, the most severe sanction allowed under theDistrict's policy is suspension from extracurricular athletic
programs. Ante, at 651. I comprehend the Court's opinion
as reserving the question whether the District, on no morethan the showing made here, constitutionally could impose

routine drug testing not only on those seeking to engagewith others in team sports, but on all students required to
attend school. Cf. United States v. Edwards, 498 F. 2d 496,500 (CA2 1974) (Friendly, J.) (in contrast to search without
notice and opportunity to avoid examination, airport searchof passengers and luggage is avoidable "by choosing not to
travel by air") (internal quotation marks omitted).

Justice O'Connor, with whom Justice Stevens and
Justice Souter join, dissenting.

The population of our Nation's public schools, grades 7
through 12, numbers around 18 million. See U. S. Dept. of

O'Connor, J., dissenting
Education, National Center for Education Statistics, Digest
of Education Statistics 58 (1994) (Table 43). By the reasoning of today's decision, the millions of these students who
participate in interscholastic sports, an overwhelming majority of whom have given school officials no reason whatsoever
to suspect they use drugs at school, are open to an intrusive
bodily search.

In justifying this result, the Court dispenses with a requirement of individualized suspicion on considered policy
grounds. First, it explains that precisely because every student athlete is being tested, there is no concern that school
officials might act arbitrarily in choosing whom to test. Second, a broad-based search regime, the Court reasons, dilutes
the accusatory nature of the search. In making these policy
arguments, of course, the Court sidesteps powerful, countervailing privacy concerns. Blanket searches, because they
can involve "thousands or millions" of searches, "pos[e] a
greater threat to liberty" than do suspicion-based ones,
which "affec[t] one person at a time," Illinois v. Krull, 480
U. S. 340, 365 (1987) (O'Connor, J., dissenting). Searches
based on individualized suspicion also afford potential targets considerable control over whether they will, in fact, be
searched because a person can avoid such a search by not
acting in an objectively suspicious way. And given that the
surest way to avoid acting suspiciously is to avoid the underlying wrongdoing, the costs of such a regime, one would
think, are minimal.

But whether a blanket search is "better," ante, at 664, than
a regime based on individualized suspicion is not a debate in
which we should engage. In my view, it is not open to
judges or government officials to decide on policy grounds
which is better and which is worse. For most of our constitutional history, mass, suspicionless searches have been generally considered per se unreasonable within the meaning of
the Fourth Amendment. And we have allowed exceptions

in recent years only where it has been clear that a suspicion-based regime would be ineffectual. Because that is not the

case here, I dissent. I

A
In Carroll v. United States, 267 U. S. 132 (1925), the Court
explained that "[t]he Fourth Amendment does not denounceall searches or seizures, but only such as are unreasonable."

Id., at 147. Applying this standard, the Court first held thata search of a car was not unreasonable merely because it was
warrantless; because obtaining a warrant is impractical for
an easily movable object such as a car, the Court explained,a warrant is not required. The Court also held, however,

that a warrantless car search was unreasonable unless sup-ported by some level of individualized suspicion, namely,
probable cause. Significantly, the Court did not base its con-clusion on the

express probable cause requirement contained
in the Warrant Clause, which, as just noted, the Court foundinapplicable. Rather, the Court rested its views on "what

was deemed an unreasonable search and seizure when [the
Fourth Amendment] was adopted" and "[what] will conservepublic interests as well as the interests and rights of individual citizens." Id., at 149. With respect to the "rights ofindividual citizens," the Court eventually offered the simple
yet powerful intuition that "those lawfully within the coun-try, entitled to use the public highways, have a right to free
passage without interruption or search unless there is knownto a competent official authorized to search, probable cause
for believing that their vehicles are carrying contraband or
illegal merchandise." Id., at 154.

More important for the purposes of this case, the Court
clearly indicated that evenhanded treatment was no substitute for the individualized suspicion requirement:

"It would be intolerable and unreasonable if a prohibition agent were authorized to stop every automobile on

O'Connor, J., dissenting
the chance of finding liquor and thus subject all personslawfully using the highways to the inconvenience and

indignity of such a search." Id., at 153-154.
The Carroll Court's view that blanket searches are "intol-erable and unreasonable" is well grounded in history. As

recently confirmed in one of the most exhaustive analyses ofthe original meaning of the Fourth Amendment ever undertaken, see W. Cuddihy, The Fourth Amendment: Origins andOriginal Meaning (1990) (Ph.D. Dissertation at Claremont
Graduate School) (hereinafter Cuddihy), what the Framersof the Fourth Amendment most strongly opposed, with
limited exceptions wholly inapplicable here, were generalsearches--that is, searches by general warrant, by writ of
assistance, by broad statute, or by any other similar author-ity. See id., at 1402, 1499, 1555; see also Clancy, The Role
of Individualized Suspicion in Assessing the Reasonablenessof Searches and Seizures, 25 Mem. St. U. L. Rev. 483, 528
(1994); Maclin, When the Cure for the Fourth Amendment IsWorse Than the Disease, 68 S. Cal. L. Rev. 1, 9-12 (1994); L.
Levy, Original Intent and the Framers' Constitution 221-246(1988). Although, ironically, such warrants, writs, and statutes typically required individualized suspicion, see, e. g.,Cuddihy 1140 ("Typical of the American warrants of 1761-76
was Starke's `tobacco' warrant, which commanded its bearerto `enter any suspected Houses' ") (emphasis added), such requirements were subjective and largely unenforceable. Ac-cordingly, these various forms of authority led in practice to
"virtually unrestrained," and hence "general," searches. J.Landynski, Search and Seizure and the Supreme Court 20
(1966). To be sure, the Fourth Amendment, in the WarrantClause, prohibits by name only searches by general warrants. But that was only because the abuses of the generalwarrant were particularly vivid in the minds of the Framers'
generation, Cuddihy 1554-1560, and not because the Framersviewed other kinds of general searches as any less unreasonable. "Prohibition of the general warrant was part of a

larger scheme to extinguish general searches categorically."
Id., at 1499.

More important, there is no indication in the historical ma-terials that the Framers' opposition to general searches

stemmed solely from the fact that they allowed officials to
single out individuals for arbitrary reasons, and thus thatofficials could render them reasonable simply by making sure

to extend their search to every house in a given area or to
every person in a given group. See Delaware v. Prouse, 440
U. S. 648, 664 (1979) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting) (referringto this as the " `misery loves company' " theory of the Fourth

Amendment). On the contrary, although general searches
were typically arbitrary, they were not invariably so. Some
general searches, for example, were of the arguably evenhanded "door-to-door" kind. Cuddihy 1091; see also id., at
377, 1502, 1557. Indeed, Cuddihy's descriptions of a few
blanket searches suggest they may have been considered
more worrisome than the typical general search. See id., at
575 ("One type of warrant [between 1700 and 1760] went
beyond a general search, in which the searcher entered and
inspected suspicious places, by requiring him to search entire
categories of places whether he suspected them or not"); id.,
at 478 ("During the exigencies of Queen Anne's War, two
colonies even authorized searches in 1706 that extended to
entire geographic areas, not just to suspicious houses in a
district, as conventional general warrants allowed").

Perhaps most telling of all, as reflected in the text of the
Warrant Clause, the particular way the Framers chose to
curb the abuses of general warrants--and by implication, all
general searches--was not to impose a novel "evenhandedness" requirement; it was to retain the individualized suspicion requirement contained in the typical general warrant,
but to make that requirement meaningful and enforceable,
for instance, by raising the required level of individualized
suspicion to objective probable cause. See U. S. Const.,
Amdt. 4. So, for example, when the same Congress that

proposed the Fourth Amendment authorized duty collectorsto search for concealed goods subject to import duties, specific warrants were required for searches on land; but evenfor searches at sea, where warrants were impractical and
thus not required, Congress nonetheless limited officials to
searching only those ships and vessels "in which [a collector]
shall have reason to suspect any goods, wares or merchandise subject to duty shall be concealed." The Collection Actof July 31, 1789, $ 24, 1 Stat. 43 (emphasis added); see also

Cuddihy 1490-1491 ("The Collection Act of 1789 was [the]most significant [of all early search statutes], for it identified
the techniques of search and seizure that the framers of the
amendment believed reasonable while they were framing
it"). Not surprisingly, the Carroll Court relied on this statute and other subsequent ones like it in arriving at its views.
See Carroll, 267 U. S., at 150-151, 154; cf. Clancy, supra, at
489 ("While the plain language of the Amendment does not
mandate individualized suspicion as a necessary component
of all searches and seizures, the historical record demonstrates that the framers believed that individualized suspicion was an inherent quality of reasonable searches and
seizures").

True, not all searches around the time the Fourth Amendment was adopted required individualized suspicion--although most did. A search incident to arrest was an obvious
example of one that did not, see Cuddihy 1518, but even
those searches shared the essential characteristics that
distinguish suspicion-based searches from abusive general
searches: they only "affec[t] one person at a time," Krull, 480
U. S., at 365 (O'Connor, J., dissenting), and they are generally avoidable by refraining from wrongdoing. See supra,
at 667. Protection of privacy, not evenhandedness, was then
and is now the touchstone of the Fourth Amendment.

The view that mass, suspicionless searches, however evenhanded, are generally unreasonable remains inviolate in the
criminal law enforcement context, see Ybarra v. Illinois, 444

U. S. 85 (1979) (invalidating evenhanded, nonaccusatory pat-down for weapons of all patrons in a tavern in which there

was probable cause to think drug dealing was going on), atleast where the search is more than minimally intrusive, see
Michigan Dept. of State Police v. Sitz, 496 U. S. 444 (1990)
(upholding the brief and easily avoidable detention, for pur-poses of observing signs of intoxication, of all motorists approaching a roadblock). It is worth noting in this regardthat state-compelled, state-monitored collection and testing
of urine, while perhaps not the most intrusive of searches,see,

e. g., Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U. S. 520, 558-560 (1979) (visual
body cavity searches), is still "particularly destructive of privacy and offensive to personal dignity." Treasury Employees v. Von Raab, 489 U. S. 656, 680 (1989) (Scalia, J., dissenting); see also ante, at 658; Skinner v. Railway Labor
Executives' Assn., 489 U. S. 602, 617 (1989). We have not
hesitated to treat monitored bowel movements as highly intrusive (even in the special border search context), compare
United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U. S. 543 (1976) (brief
interrogative stops of all motorists crossing certain border
checkpoint reasonable without individualized suspicion),
with United States v. Montoya de Hernandez, 473 U. S. 531
(1985) (monitored bowel movement of border crossers reasonable only upon reasonable suspicion of alimentary canal
smuggling), and it is not easy to draw a distinction. See
Fried, Privacy, 77 Yale L. J. 475, 487 (1968) ("[I]n our culture
the excretory functions are shielded by more or less absolute
privacy"). And certainly monitored urination combined
with urine testing is more intrusive than some personal
searches we have said trigger Fourth Amendment protections in the past. See, e. g., Cupp v. Murphy, 412 U. S. 291,
295 (1973) (Stewart, J.) (characterizing the scraping of dirt
from under a person's fingernails as a " `severe, though brief,
intrusion upon cherished personal security' ") (citation omitted). Finally, the collection and testing of urine is, of course,
a search of a person, one of only four categories of suspect

searches the Constitution mentions by name. See U. S.Const., Amdt. 4 (listing "persons, houses, papers, and effects"); cf. Cuddihy 835, 1518, 1552, n. 394 (indicating longhistory of outrage at personal searches before 1789).

Thus, it remains the law that the police cannot, say, subject
to drug testing every person entering or leaving a certaindrug-ridden neighborhood in order to find evidence of crime.

3 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure $ 9.5(b), pp. 551-553 (2d ed.1987) (hereinafter LaFave). And this is true even though it
is hard to think of a more compelling government interestthan the need to fight the scourge of drugs on our streets
and in our neighborhoods. Nor could it be otherwise, for if
being evenhanded were enough to justify evaluating a search
regime under an open-ended balancing test, the Warrant
Clause, which presupposes that there is some category of
searches for which individualized suspicion is nonnegotiable,
see 2 LaFave $ 4.1, at 118, would be a dead letter.

Outside the criminal context, however, in response to the
exigencies of modern life, our cases have upheld several
evenhanded blanket searches, including some that are more
than minimally intrusive, after balancing the invasion of privacy against the government's strong need. Most of these
cases, of course, are distinguishable insofar as they involved
searches either not of a personally intrusive nature, such as
searches of closely regulated businesses, see, e. g., New York
v. Burger, 482 U. S. 691, 699-703 (1987); cf. Cuddihy 1501
("Even the states with the strongest constitutional restrictions on general searches had long exposed commercial establishments to warrantless inspection"), or arising in unique
contexts such as prisons, see, e. g., Wolfish, supra, at 558-560
(visual body cavity searches of prisoners following contact
visits); cf. Cuddihy 1516-1519, 1552-1553 (indicating that
searches incident to arrest and prisoner searches were the
only common personal searches at time of founding). This
certainly explains why Justice Scalia, in his dissent in our
recent Von Raab decision, found it significant that "[u]ntil

today this Court had upheld a bodily search separate fromarrest and without individualized suspicion of wrongdoing

only with respect to prison inmates, relying upon theuniquely dangerous nature of that environment."

Von
Raab, supra, at 680 (citation omitted).

In any event, in many of the cases that can be distin-guished on the grounds suggested above and, more important, in all of the cases that cannot, see, e. g., Skinner, supra(blanket drug testing scheme);

Von Raab, supra (same);
cf. Camara v. Municipal Court of City and County of San
Francisco, 387 U. S. 523 (1967) (area-wide searches of private
residences), we upheld the suspicionless search only after
first recognizing the Fourth Amendment's longstanding preference for a suspicion-based search regime, and then pointing to sound reasons why such a regime would likely be ineffectual under the unusual circumstances presented. In
Skinner, for example, we stated outright that " `some quantum of individualized suspicion' " is "usually required" under
the Fourth Amendment, Skinner, supra, at 624, quoting
Martinez-Fuerte, supra, at 560, and we built the requirement into the test we announced: "In limited circumstances,
where the privacy interests implicated by the search are
minimal, and where an important governmental interest furthered by the intrusion would be placed in jeopardy by a
requirement of individualized suspicion, a search may be
reasonable despite the absence of such suspicion," 489 U. S.,
at 624 (emphasis added). The obvious negative implication
of this reasoning is that, if such an individualized suspicion
requirement would not place the government's objectives in
jeopardy, the requirement should not be forsaken. See also
Von Raab, supra, at 665-666.

Accordingly, we upheld the suspicionless regime at issue
in Skinner on the firm understanding that a requirement of
individualized suspicion for testing train operators for drug
or alcohol impairment following serious train accidents
would be unworkable because "the scene of a serious rail

accident is chaotic." Skinner, 489 U. S., at 631. (Of course,it could be plausibly argued that the fact that testing occurred only after train operators were involved in serioustrain accidents amounted to an individualized suspicion requirement in all but name, in light of the record evidence of
a strong link between serious train accidents and drug andalcohol use.) We have performed a similar inquiry in the

other cases as well. See Von Raab, 489 U. S., at 674 (suspi-cion requirement for searches of customs officials for drug
impairment impractical because "not feasible to subject[such] employees and their work product to the kind of dayto-day scrutiny that is the norm in more traditional office
environments"); Camara, supra, at 537 (suspicion requirement for searches of homes for safety code violations impractical because conditions such as "faulty wiring" not observable from outside of house); see also Wolfish, 441 U. S., at
559-560, n. 40 (suspicion requirement for searches of prisoners for smuggling following contact visits impractical because observation necessary to gain suspicion would cause
"obvious disruption of the confidentiality and intimacy that
these visits are intended to afford"); Martinez-Fuerte, 428
U. S., at 557 ("A requirement that stops on major routes inland always be based on reasonable suspicion would be impractical because the flow of traffic tends to be too heavy to
allow the particularized study of a given car that would enable it to be identified as a possible carrier of illegal aliens");

(Friendly, J.) (suspicion-based searches of airport passengers'
carry-on luggage impractical because of the great number of
plane travelers and "conceded inapplicability" of the profile
method of detecting hijackers).

Moreover, an individualized suspicion requirement was
often impractical in these cases because they involved situations in which even one undetected instance of wrongdoing
could have injurious consequences for a great number of people. See, e. g., Camara, supra, at 535 (even one safety code

alcohol-impaired train operator can lead to the "disastrousconsequences" of a train wreck, such as "great human loss");
Von Raab, supra, at 670, 674, 677 (even one customs officialcaught up in drugs can, by virtue of impairment, susceptibility to bribes, or indifference, result in the noninterdiction ofa "sizable drug shipmen[t]," which eventually injures the
lives of thousands, or to a breach of "national security");
Edwards, supra, at 500 (even one hijacked airplane candestroy " `hundreds of human lives and millions of dollars

B
The instant case stands in marked contrast. One searchestoday's majority opinion in vain for recognition that history

and precedent establish that individualized suspicion is "usu-ally required" under the Fourth Amendment (regardless of
whether a warrant and probable cause are also required) andthat, in the area of intrusive personal searches, the only recognized exception is for situations in which a suspicion-basedscheme would be likely ineffectual. See supra, at 674-675
and this page. Far from acknowledging anything specialabout individualized suspicion, the Court treats a suspicionbased regime as if it were just any run-of-the-mill, less intru-sive alternative--that is, an alternative that officials may bypass if the lesser intrusion, in their reasonable estimation, isoutweighed by policy concerns unrelated to practicability.

As an initial matter, I have serious doubts whether theCourt is right that the District reasonably found that the
lesser intrusion of a suspicion-based testing program out-weighed its genuine concerns for the adversarial nature of
such a program, and for its abuses. See ante, at 663-664.For one thing, there are significant safeguards against
abuses. The fear that a suspicion-based regime will lead tothe testing of "troublesome but not drug-likely" students,

677Cite as: 515 U. S. 646 (1995)
O'Connor, J., dissenting
ante, at 663, for example, ignores that the required level ofsuspicion in the school context is objectively

reasonable suspicion. In this respect, the facts of our decision in New Jersey v. T. L. O., 469 U. S. 325 (1985), should be reassuring.
There, we found reasonable suspicion to search a ninth-grade
girl's purse for cigarettes after a teacher caught the girlsmoking in the bathroom with a companion who admitted

it. See id., at 328, 345-346. Moreover, any distress arisingfrom what turns out to be a false accusation can be minimized by keeping the entire process confidential.For another thing, the District's concern for the adversarial nature of a suspicion-based regime (which appears to extend even to those who are rightly accused) seems to ignore
the fact that such a regime would not exist in a vacuum.
Schools already have adversarial, disciplinary schemes that
require teachers and administrators in many areas besides
drug use to investigate student wrongdoing (often by means
of accusatory searches); to make determinations about
whether the wrongdoing occurred; and to impose punishment. To such a scheme, suspicion-based drug testing
would be only a minor addition. The District's own elaborate disciplinary scheme is reflected in its handbook, which,
among other things, lists the following disciplinary "problem
areas" carrying serious sanctions: "DEFIANCE OF AUTHORITY," "DISORDERLY OR DISRUPTIVE CONDUCT INCLUDING FOUL LANGUAGE," "AUTOMOBILE USE OR MISUSE," "FORGERY OR LYING,"
"GAMBLING, " "THEFT, " "TOBACCO, " "MISCHIEF, "
"VANDALISM, " "RECKLESSLY ENDANGERING, "
"MENACING OR HARASSMENT," "ASSAULT," "FIGHTING," "WEAPONS," "EXTORTION," "EXPLOSIVE DEVICES," and "ARSON." Record, Exh. 2, p. 11; see also id.,
at 20-21 (listing rules regulating dress and grooming, public
displays of affection, and the wearing of hats inside); cf. id.,
at 8 ("RESPONSIBILITIES OF SCHOOLS" include "To develop and distribute to parents and students reasonable rules

and regulations governing student behavior and attendance"and "To provide fair and reasonable standards of conduct and

to enforce those standards through appropriate disciplinaryaction"). The high number of disciplinary referrals in the
record in this case illustrates the District's robust scheme
in action.In addition to overstating its concerns with a suspicionbased program, the District seems to have understated theextent to which such a program is less intrusive of students'
privacy. By invading the privacy of a few students ratherthan many (nationwide, of thousands rather than millions),
and by giving potential search targets substantial control
over whether they will, in fact, be searched, a suspicionbased scheme is significantly less intrusive.

In any event, whether the Court is right that the District
reasonably weighed the lesser intrusion of a suspicion-based
scheme against its policy concerns is beside the point. As
stated, a suspicion-based search regime is not just any less
intrusive alternative; the individualized suspicion requirement has a legal pedigree as old as the Fourth Amendment
itself, and it may not be easily cast aside in the name of policy
concerns. It may only be forsaken, our cases in the personal
search context have established, if a suspicion-based regime
would likely be ineffectual.

But having misconstrued the fundamental role of the individualized suspicion requirement in Fourth Amendment
analysis, the Court never seriously engages the practicality
of such a requirement in the instant case. And that failure
is crucial because nowhere is it less clear that an individualized suspicion requirement would be ineffectual than in the
school context. In most schools, the entire pool of potential
search targets--students--is under constant supervision by
teachers and administrators and coaches, be it in classrooms,
hallways, or locker rooms. See T. L. O., 469 U. S., at 339
("[A] proper educational environment requires close supervision of schoolchildren").

The record here indicates that the Vernonia schools are noexception. The great irony of this case is that most (though

not all) of the evidence the District introduced to justify itssuspicionless drug testing program consisted of first- or
second-hand stories of particular, identifiable students acting
in ways that plainly gave rise to reasonable suspicion of in-school drug use--and thus that would have justified a drugrelated search under our T. L. O. decision. See id., at 340-342 (warrant and probable cause not required for school
searches; reasonable suspicion sufficient). Small groups ofstudents, for example, were observed by a teacher "passing
joints back and forth" across the street at a restaurant before
school and during school hours. Tr. 67 (Apr. 29, 1992). Another group was caught skipping school and using drugs
at one of the students' houses. See id., at 93-94. Several
students actually admitted their drug use to school officials
(some of them being caught with marijuana pipes). See id.,
at 24. One student presented himself to his teacher as
"clearly obviously inebriated" and had to be sent home. Id.,
at 68. Still another was observed dancing and singing at
the top of his voice in the back of the classroom; when the
teacher asked what was going on, he replied, "Well, I'm just
high on life." Id., at 89-90. To take a final example, on a
certain road trip, the school wrestling coach smelled marijuana smoke in a motel room occupied by four wrestlers, see
id., at 110-112, an observation that (after some questioning)
would probably have given him reasonable suspicion to test
one or all of them. Cf. 4 LaFave $ 10.11(b), at 169 ("[I]n
most instances the evidence of wrongdoing prompting teachers or principals to conduct searches is sufficiently detailed
and specific to meet the traditional probable cause test").

In light of all this evidence of drug use by particular students, there is a substantial basis for concluding that a vigorous regime of suspicion-based testing (for which the District
appears already to have rules in place, see Record, Exh. 2,
at 14, 17) would have gone a long way toward solving Ver515us3$87J 08-12-98 17:56:26 PAGES OPINPGT

O'Connor, J., dissenting
nonia's school drug problem while preserving the FourthAmendment rights of James Acton and others like him.

And were there any doubt about such a conclusion, it is re-moved by indications in the record that suspicion-based testing could have been supplemented by an equally vigorous
campaign to have Vernonia's parents encourage their chil-dren to submit to the District's

voluntary drug testing program. See id., at 32 (describing the voluntary program);
ante, at 665 (noting widespread parental support for drug
testing). In these circumstances, the Fourth Amendmentdictates that a mass, suspicionless search regime is categorically unreasonable.

I recognize that a suspicion-based scheme, even where reasonably effective in controlling in-school drug use, may not
be as effective as a mass, suspicionless testing regime. In
one sense, that is obviously true--just as it is obviously true
that suspicion-based law enforcement is not as effective as
mass, suspicionless enforcement might be. "But there is
nothing new in the realization" that Fourth Amendment protections come with a price. Arizona v. Hicks, 480 U. S. 321,
329 (1987). Indeed, the price we pay is higher in the criminal context, given that police do not closely observe the entire class of potential search targets (all citizens in the area)
and must ordinarily adhere to the rigid requirements of a
warrant and probable cause.

The principal counterargument to all this, central to the
Court's opinion, is that the Fourth Amendment is more lenient with respect to school searches. That is no doubt correct, for, as the Court explains, ante, at 655-656, schools have
traditionally had special guardianlike responsibilities for
children that necessitate a degree of constitutional leeway.
This principle explains the considerable Fourth Amendment
leeway we gave school officials in T. L. O. In that case, we
held that children at school do not enjoy two of the Fourth
Amendment's traditional categorical protections against unreasonable searches and seizures: the warrant requirement

and the probable cause requirement. See T. L. O., 469 U. S.,at 337-343. And this was true even though the same children enjoy such protections "in a nonschool setting." Id., at348 (Powell, J., concurring).

The instant case, however, asks whether the FourthAmendment is even more lenient than that,

i. e., whether itis so lenient that students may be deprived of the Fourth

Amendment's only remaining, and most basic, categoricalprotection: its strong preference for an individualized suspicion requirement, with its accompanying antipathy towardpersonally intrusive, blanket searches of mostly innocent
people. It is not at all clear that people in prison lack thiscategorical protection, see

Wolfish, 441 U. S., at 558-560 (up-holding certain suspicionless searches of prison inmates); but

cf. supra, at 675 (indicating why suspicion requirement wasimpractical in Wolfish), and we have said "[w]e are not yet
ready to hold that the schools and the prisons need beequated for purposes of the Fourth Amendment." T. L. O.,
supra, at 338-339. Thus, if we are to mean what we oftenproclaim--that students do not "shed their constitutional
rights . . . at the schoolhouse gate," Tinker v. Des Moines
Independent Community School Dist., 393 U. S. 503, 506(1969)--the answer must plainly be no.

1

1 The Court says I pay short shrift to the original meaning of the Fourth
Amendment as it relates to searches of public school children. See ante,
at 665, n. 4. As an initial matter, the historical materials on what the
Framers thought of official searches of children, let alone of public school
children (the concept of which did not exist at the time, see ante, at 652,
n. 1), are extremely scarce. Perhaps because of this, the Court does not
itself offer an account of the original meaning, but rather resorts to the
general proposition that children had fewer recognized rights at the time
of the framing than they do today. But that proposition seems uniquely
unhelpful in the present case, for although children may have had fewer
rights against the private schoolmaster at the time of the framing than
they have against public school officials today, parents plainly had greater
rights then than now. At the time of the framing, for example, the fact
that a child's parents refused to authorize a private schoolmaster's search
of the child would probably have rendered any such search unlawful; after

O'Connor, J., dissenting
For the contrary position, the Court relies on cases suchas

T. L. O., Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U. S. 651 (1977), and
Goss v. Lopez, 419 U. S. 565 (1975). See ante, at 655-656.But I find the Court's reliance on these cases ironic. If anything, they affirm that schools have substantial constitutional
leeway in carrying out their traditional mission of respond-ing to

particularized wrongdoing. See T. L. O., supra (leeway in investigating particularized wrongdoing); Ingraham,
supra (leeway in punishing particularized wrongdoing);
Goss, supra (leeway in choosing procedures by which partic-ularized wrongdoing is punished).

By contrast, intrusive, blanket searches of schoolchildren,most of whom are innocent, for evidence of serious wrongdoing are not part of any traditional school function of which I
am aware. Indeed, many schools, like many parents, preferto trust their children unless given reason to do otherwise.

As James Acton's father said on the witness stand, "[suspicionless testing] sends a message to children that are trying
to be responsible citizens . . . that they have to prove that
they're innocent . . . , and I think that kind of sets a bad tone
for citizenship." Tr. 9 (Apr. 29, 1992).

I find unpersuasive the Court's reliance, ante, at 656-657,
on the widespread practice of physical examinations and vaccinations, which are both blanket searches of a sort. Of
course, for these practices to have any Fourth Amendment
significance, the Court has to assume that these physical
exams and vaccinations are typically "required" to a similar
extent that urine testing and collection is required in the instant case, i. e., that they are required regardless of parental

all, at common law, the source of the schoolmaster's authority over a child
was a delegation of the parent's authority. See ante, at 654-655. Today,
of course, the fact that a child's parents refuse to authorize a public school
search of the child--as James Acton's parents refused here--is of little
constitutional moment. Cf. Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U. S. 651, 662, n. 22
(1977) ("[P]arental approval of corporal punishment is not constitutionally required").

objection and that some meaningful sanction attaches to thefailure to submit. In any event, without forming any particular view of such searches, it is worth noting that a suspicionrequirement for vaccinations is not merely impractical; it is
nonsensical, for vaccinations are not searches for anything
in particular and so there is nothing about which to be suspi-cious. Nor is this saying anything new; it is the same theory

on which, in part, we have repeatedly upheld certain inven-tory searches. See,

e. g., South Dakota v. Opperman, 428
U. S. 364, 370, n. 5 (1976) ("The probable-cause approach isunhelpful when analysis centers upon the reasonableness of

routine administrative caretaking functions"). As for physical examinations, the practicability of a suspicion requirement is highly doubtful because the conditions for which
these physical exams ordinarily search, such as latent heart
conditions, do not manifest themselves in observable behavior the way school drug use does. See supra, at 679-680.

It might also be noted that physical exams (and of course
vaccinations) are not searches for conditions that reflect
wrongdoing on the part of the student, and so are wholly
nonaccusatory and have no consequences that can be regarded as punitive. These facts may explain the absence of
Fourth Amendment challenges to such searches. By contrast, although I agree with the Court that the accusatory
nature of the District's testing program is diluted by making
it a blanket one, any testing program that searches for conditions plainly reflecting serious wrongdoing can never be
made wholly nonaccusatory from the student's perspective,
the motives for the program notwithstanding; and for the
same reason, the substantial consequences that can flow
from a positive test, such as suspension from sports, are invariably--and quite reasonably--understood as punishment.
The best proof that the District's testing program is to some
extent accusatory can be found in James Acton's own explanation on the witness stand as to why he did not want to
submit to drug testing: "Because I feel that they have no

It is hard to think of a manner of explanation that resonates
more intensely in our Fourth Amendment tradition than this.

II
I do not believe that suspicionless drug testing is justified
on these facts. But even if I agreed that some such testing
were reasonable here, I see two other Fourth Amendment
flaws in the District's program.2 First, and most serious,
there is virtually no evidence in the record of a drug problem
at the Washington Grade School, which includes the seventh
and eighth grades, and which Acton attended when this litigation began. This is not surprising, given that, of the four
witnesses who testified to drug-related incidents, three were
teachers and/or coaches at the high school, see Tr. 65; id., at
86; id., at 99, and the fourth, though the principal of the
grade school at the time of the litigation, had been employed
as principal of the high school during the years leading up
to (and beyond) the implementation of the drug testing policy. See id., at 17. The only evidence of a grade school
drug problem that my review of the record uncovered is a
"guarantee" by the late-arriving grade school principal that
"our problems we've had in '88 and '89 didn't start at the
high school level. They started in the elementary school."
Id., at 43. But I would hope that a single assertion of this
sort would not serve as an adequate basis on which to uphold
mass, suspicionless drug testing of two entire grades of student athletes--in Vernonia and, by the Court's reasoning, in
other school districts as well. Perhaps there is a drug problem at the grade school, but one would not know it from this

2 Because I agree with the Court that we may assume the District's
program allows students to confine the advanced disclosure of highly personal prescription medications to the testing lab, see ante, at 660, I also
agree that Skinner controls this aspect of the case, and so do not count
the disclosure requirement among the program's flaws.

record. At the least, then, I would insist that the partiesand the District Court address this issue on remand.

Second, even as to the high school, I find unreasonable theschool's choice of student athletes as the class to subject to
suspicionless testing--a choice that appears to have been
driven more by a belief in what would pass constitutionalmuster, see

id., at 45-47 (indicating that the original program was targeted at students involved in any extracurricu-lar activity), than by a belief in what was required to meet

the District's principal disciplinary concern. Reading thefull record in this case, as well as the District Court's authoritative summary of it, 796 F. Supp. 1354, 1356-1357 (Ore.
1992), it seems quite obvious that the true driving force behind the District's adoption of its drug testing program was
the need to combat the rise in drug-related disorder and disruption in its classrooms and around campus. I mean no
criticism of the strength of that interest. On the contrary,
where the record demonstrates the existence of such a problem, that interest seems self-evidently compelling. "Without first establishing discipline and maintaining order, teachers cannot begin to educate their students." T. L. O., 469
U. S., at 350 (Powell, J., concurring). And the record in this
case surely demonstrates there was a drug-related discipline
problem in Vernonia of " `epidemic proportions.' " 796
F. Supp., at 1357. The evidence of a drug-related sports
injury problem at Vernonia, by contrast, was considerably
weaker.

On this record, then, it seems to me that the far more
reasonable choice would have been to focus on the class of
students found to have violated published school rules
against severe disruption in class and around campus, see
Record, Exh. 2, at 9, 11--disruption that had a strong nexus
to drug use, as the District established at trial. Such a
choice would share two of the virtues of a suspicion-based
regime: testing dramatically fewer students, tens as against
hundreds, and giving students control, through their behav515us3$87J 08-12-98 17:56:26 PAGES OPINPGT

ior, over the likelihood that they would be tested. More-over, there would be a reduced concern for the accusatory

nature of the search, because the Court's feared "badge ofshame," ante, at 663, would already exist, due to the antecedent accusation and finding of severe disruption. In a lesserknown aspect of

Skinner, we upheld an analogous testingscheme with little hesitation. See Skinner, 489 U. S., at 611

(describing " `Authorization to Test for Cause' " scheme, ac-cording to which train operators would be tested "in the
event of certain specific rule violations, including noncompli-ance with a signal and excessive speeding").

III
It cannot be too often stated that the greatest threats toour constitutional freedoms come in times of crisis. But we

must also stay mindful that not all government responses tosuch times are hysterical overreactions; some crises are
quite real, and when they are, they serve precisely as thecompelling state interest that we have said may justify a
measured intrusion on constitutional rights. The only wayfor judges to mediate these conflicting impulses is to do what
they should do anyway: stay close to the record in each casethat appears before them, and make their judgments based
on that alone. Having reviewed the record here, I cannotavoid the conclusion that the District's suspicionless policy
of testing all student athletes sweeps too broadly, and tooimprecisely, to be reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.

BABBITT, SECRETARY OF INTERIOR, et al. v.SWEET HOME CHAPTER OF COMMUNITIES

FOR A GREAT OREGON et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe district of columbia circuit

No. 94-859. Argued April 17, 1995--Decided June 29, 1995
As relevant here, the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA or Act) makes

it unlawful for any person to "take" endangered or threatened species,

$ 9(a)(1)(B), and defines "take" to mean to "harass, harm, pursue,"
"wound," or "kill," $ 3(19). In 50 CFR $ 17.3, petitioner Secretary of
the Interior further defines "harm" to include "significant habitat modification or degradation where it actually kills or injures wildlife." Respondents, persons and entities dependent on the forest products industries and others, challenged this regulation on its face, claiming that
Congress did not intend the word "take" to include habitat modification.
The District Court granted petitioners summary judgment, but the
Court of Appeals ultimately reversed. Invoking the noscitur a sociis
canon of statutory construction, which holds that a word is known by
the company it keeps, the court concluded that "harm," like the other
words in the definition of "take," should be read as applying only to the
perpetrator's direct application of force against the animal taken.

Held: The Secretary reasonably construed Congress' intent when he

defined "harm" to include habitat modification. Pp. 696-708.

(a) The Act provides three reasons for preferring the Secretary's interpretation. First, the ordinary meaning of "harm" naturally encompasses habitat modification that results in actual injury or death to
members of an endangered or threatened species. Unless "harm" encompasses indirect as well as direct injuries, the word has no meaning
that does not duplicate that of other words that $ 3 uses to define "take."
Second, the ESA's broad purpose of providing comprehensive protection
for endangered and threatened species supports the reasonableness of
the Secretary's definition. Respondents advance strong arguments
that activities causing minimal or unforeseeable harm will not violate
the Act as construed in the regulation, but their facial challenge would
require that the Secretary's understanding of harm be invalidated in
every circumstance. Third, the fact that Congress in 1982 authorized
the Secretary to issue permits for takings that $ 9(a)(1)(B) would otherwise prohibit, "if such taking is incidental to, and not for the purpose of,

the carrying out of an otherwise lawful activity," $ 10(a)(1)(B), strongly
suggests that Congress understood $ 9 to prohibit indirect as well as
deliberate takings. No one could seriously request an "incidental" take
permit to avert $ 9 liability for direct, deliberate action against a member of an endangered or threatened species. Pp. 696-701.

(b) The Court of Appeals made three errors in finding that "harm"
must refer to a direct application of force because the words around it
do. First, the court's premise was flawed. Several of the words accompanying "harm" in $ 3's definition of "take" refer to actions or effects
that do not require direct applications of force. Second, to the extent
that it read an intent or purpose requirement into the definition of
"take," it ignored $ 9's express provision that a "knowing" action is
enough to violate the Act. Third, the court employed noscitur a sociis
to give "harm" essentially the same function as other words in the definition, thereby denying it independent meaning. Pp. 701-702.

(c) The Act's inclusion of land acquisition authority, $ 5, and a directive
to federal agencies to avoid destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat, $ 7, does not alter the conclusion reached in this case. Respondents' argument that the Government lacks any incentive to purchase land under $ 5 when it can simply prohibit takings under $ 9
ignores the practical considerations that purchasing habitat lands may
be less expensive than pursuing criminal or civil penalties and that $ 5
allows for protection of habitat before any endangered animal has been
harmed, whereas $ 9 cannot be enforced until a killing or injury has
occurred. Section 7's directive applies only to the Federal Government,
whereas $ 9 applies to "any person." Pp. 702-704.

(d) The conclusion reached here gains further support from the statute's legislative history. Pp. 704-708.

FOR GREAT ORE.

Opinion of the Court

Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court.
The Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA or Act), 87 Stat.
884, 16 U. S. C. $ 1531 (1988 ed. and Supp. V), contains a variety of protections designed to save from extinction species
that the Secretary of the Interior designates as endangered
or threatened. Section 9 of the Act makes it unlawful for
any person to "take" any endangered or threatened species.
The Secretary has promulgated a regulation that defines the
statute's prohibition on takings to include "significant habitat
modification or degradation where it actually kills or injures
wildlife." This case presents the question whether the Secretary exceeded his authority under the Act by promulgating that regulation.

I

Section 9(a)(1) of the Act provides the following protection
for endangered species: 1

"Except as provided in sections 1535(g)(2) and 1539 of
this title, with respect to any endangered species of fish
or wildlife listed pursuant to section 1533 of this title it
is unlawful for any person subject to the jurisdiction of
the United States to--. . . . .

1 The Act defines the term "endangered species" to mean "any species

which is in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of
its range other than a species of the Class Insecta determined by the
Secretary to constitute a pest whose protection under the provisions of
this chapter would present an overwhelming and overriding risk to man."

Opinion of the Court
"(B) take any such species within the United Statesor the territorial sea of the United States." 16

U. S. C. $ 1538(a)(1).
Section 3(19) of the Act defines the statutory term "take":

"The term `take' means to harass, harm, pursue, hunt,shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect, or to attempt

to engage in any such conduct." 16 U. S. C. $ 1532(19).
The Act does not further define the terms it uses to define"take." The Interior Department regulations that implement the statute, however, define the statutory term "harm":

"Harm in the definition of `take' in the Act means anact which actually kills or injures wildlife. Such act

may include significant habitat modification or degrada-tion where it actually kills or injures wildlife by significantly impairing essential behavioral patterns, includingbreeding, feeding, or sheltering." 50 CFR $ 17.3 (1994).

This regulation has been in place since 1975.2A limitation on the $ 9 "take" prohibition appears in

$ 10(a)(1)(B) of the Act, which Congress added by amendmentin 1982. That section authorizes the Secretary to grant a
permit for any taking otherwise prohibited by $ 9(a)(1)(B)"if such taking is incidental to, and not the purpose of, the
carrying out of an otherwise lawful activity." 16 U. S. C.$ 1539(a)(1)(B).

In addition to the prohibition on takings, the Act providesseveral other protections for endangered species. Section 4,
16 U. S. C. $ 1533, commands the Secretary to identify speciesof fish or wildlife that are in danger of extinction and to
publish from time to time lists of all species he determines to

2 The Secretary, through the Director of the Fish and Wildlife Service,
originally promulgated the regulation in 1975 and amended it in 1981 to
emphasize that actual death or injury of a protected animal is necessary
for a violation. See 40 Fed. Reg. 44412, 44416 (1975); 46 Fed. Reg. 54748,
54750 (1981).

be endangered or threatened. Section 5, 16 U. S. C. $ 1534,authorizes the Secretary, in cooperation with the States, see

$ 1535, to acquire land to aid in preserving such species.Section 7 requires federal agencies to ensure that none of
their activities, including the granting of licenses and permits, will jeopardize the continued existence of endangeredspecies "or result in the destruction or adverse modification

of habitat of such species which is determined by the Secre-tary . . . to be critical." 16 U. S. C. $ 1536(a)(2).

Respondents in this action are small landowners, loggingcompanies, and families dependent on the forest products industries in the Pacific Northwest and in the Southeast, andorganizations that represent their interests. They brought
this declaratory judgment action against petitioners, the
Secretary of the Interior and the Director of the Fish andWildlife Service, in the United States District Court for the

District of Columbia to challenge the statutory validity of
the Secretary's regulation defining "harm," particularly the
inclusion of habitat modification and degradation in the definition.3 Respondents challenged the regulation on its face.
Their complaint alleged that application of the "harm" regulation to the red-cockaded woodpecker, an endangered species,4 and the northern spotted owl, a threatened species,5
had injured them economically. App. 17-23.

3 Respondents also argued in the District Court that the Secretary's
definition of "harm" is unconstitutionally void for vagueness, but they do
not press that argument here.

4 The woodpecker was listed as an endangered species in 1970 pursuant

to the statutory predecessor of the ESA. See 50 CFR $ 17.11(h) (1994),
issued pursuant to the Endangered Species Conservation Act of 1969, 83
Stat. 275.

5 See 55 Fed. Reg. 26114 (1990). Another regulation promulgated by

the Secretary extends to threatened species, defined in the ESA as "any
species which is likely to become an endangered species within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range," 16
U. S. C. $ 1532(20), some but not all of the protections endangered species
enjoy. See 50 CFR $ 17.31(a) (1994). In the District Court respondents

Opinion of the Court
Respondents advanced three arguments to support theirsubmission that Congress did not intend the word "take" in

$ 9 to include habitat modification, as the Secretary's "harm"regulation provides. First, they correctly noted that language in the Senate's original version of the ESA would havedefined "take" to include "destruction, modification, or curtailment of [the] habitat or range" of fish or wildlife,6 but theSenate deleted that language from the bill before enacting
it. Second, respondents argued that Congress intended theAct's express authorization for the Federal Government to
buy private land in order to prevent habitat degradation in$ 5 to be the exclusive check against habitat modification on
private property. Third, because the Senate added the term"harm" to the definition of "take" in a floor amendment without debate, respondents argued that the court should notinterpret the term so expansively as to include habitat
modification.The District Court considered and rejected each of respondents' arguments, finding "that Congress intended anexpansive interpretation of the word `take,' an interpretation that encompasses habitat modification." 806 F. Supp.279, 285 (1992). The court noted that in 1982, when Congress was aware of a judicial decision that had applied theSecretary's regulation, see

Palila v. Hawaii Dept. of Landand Natural Resources, 639 F. 2d 495 (CA9 1981) (Palila I),

it amended the Act without using the opportunity to changethe definition of "take." 806 F. Supp., at 284. The court
stated that, even had it found the ESA " `silent or ambigu-ous' " as to the authority for the Secretary's definition of
"harm," it would nevertheless have upheld the regulation asa reasonable interpretation of the statute.

Id., at 285 (quotunsuccessfully challenged that regulation's extension of $ 9 to threatened
species, but they do not press the challenge here.

therefore entered summary judgment for petitioners and dis-missed respondents' complaint.

A divided panel of the Court of Appeals initially affirmedthe judgment of the District Court. 1 F. 3d 1 (CADC 1993).
After granting a petition for rehearing, however, the panelreversed. 17 F. 3d 1463 (CADC 1994). Although acknowledging that "[t]he potential breadth of the word `harm' isindisputable,"

id., at 1464, the majority concluded that theimmediate statutory context in which "harm" appeared counseled against a broad reading; like the other words in thedefinition of "take," the word "harm" should be read as
applying only to "the perpetrator's direct application of forceagainst the animal taken . . . . The forbidden acts fit, in
ordinary language, the basic model `A hit B.' " Id., at 1465.The majority based its reasoning on a canon of statutory construction called noscitur a sociis, which holds that a word isknown by the company it keeps. See

Neal v. Clark, 95 U. S.704, 708-709 (1878).

The majority claimed support for its construction from adecision of the Ninth Circuit that narrowly construed the
word "harass" in the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972,16 U. S. C. $ 1372(a)(2)(A), see

United States v. Hayashi, 5F. 3d 1278, 1282 (1993); from the legislative history of the

ESA; 7 from its view that Congress must not have intendedthe purportedly broad curtailment of private property rights
that the Secretary's interpretation permitted; and from theESA's land acquisition provision in $ 5 and restriction on
federal agencies' activities regarding habitat in $ 7, bothof which the court saw as evidence that Congress had not
intended the $ 9 "take" prohibition to reach habitat modi7 Judge Sentelle filed a partial concurrence in which he declined to join

fication. Most prominently, the court performed a lengthyanalysis of the 1982 amendment to $ 10 that provided for

"incidental take permits" and concluded that the amendmentdid not change the meaning of the term "take" as defined in
the 1973 statute.8Chief Judge Mikva, who had announced the panel's original
decision, dissented. See 17 F. 3d, at 1473. In his view, aproper application of

Chevron indicated that the Secretaryhad reasonably defined "harm," because respondents had

failed to show that Congress unambiguously manifested itsintent to exclude habitat modification from the ambit of
"take." Chief Judge Mikva found the majority's reliance onnoscitur a sociis inappropriate in light of the statutory language and unnecessary in light of the strong support in thelegislative history for the Secretary's interpretation. He
did not find the 1982 "incidental take permit" amendmentalone sufficient to vindicate the Secretary's definition of
"harm," but he believed the amendment provided additionalsupport for that definition because it reflected Congress'
view in 1982 that the definition was reasonable.The Court of Appeals' decision created a square conflict
with a 1988 decision of the Ninth Circuit that had upheld theSecretary's definition of "harm." See Palila v. Hawaii
Dept. of Land and Natural Resources, 852 F. 2d 1106 (1988)(Palila II). The Court of Appeals neither cited nor distinguished Palila II, despite the stark contrast between theNinth Circuit's holding and its own. We granted certiorari
to resolve the conflict. 513 U. S. 1072 (1995). Our consider-ation of the text and structure of the Act, its legislative history, and the significance of the 1982 amendment persuadesus that the Court of Appeals' judgment should be reversed.

8 The 1982 amendment had formed the basis on which the author of the
majority's opinion on rehearing originally voted to affirm the judgment of
the District Court. Compare 1 F. 3d 1, 11 (CADC 1993) (Williams, J.,
concurring in part), with 17 F. 3d, at 1467-1472.

FOR GREAT ORE.

Opinion of the Court

II
Because this case was decided on motions for summaryjudgment, we may appropriately make certain factual assumptions in order to frame the legal issue. First, we as-sume respondents have no desire to harm either the redcockaded woodpecker or the spotted owl; they merely wishto continue logging activities that would be entirely proper
if not prohibited by the ESA. On the other hand, we mustassume, arguendo, that those activities will have the effect,
even though unintended, of detrimentally changing the natu-ral habitat of both listed species and that, as a consequence,
members of those species will be killed or injured. Underrespondents' view of the law, the Secretary's only means of
forestalling that grave result--even when the actor knowsit is certain to occur

9--is to use his $ 5 authority to purchase

9 As discussed above, the Secretary's definition of "harm" is limited to
"act[s] which actually kil[l] or injur[e] wildlife." 50 CFR $ 17.3 (1994).
In addition, in order to be subject to the Act's criminal penalties or the
more severe of its civil penalties, one must "knowingly violat[e]" the Act
or its implementing regulations. 16 U. S. C. $$ 1540(a)(1), (b)(1). Congress added "knowingly" in place of "willfully" in 1978 to make "criminal
violations of the act a general rather than a specific intent crime." H. R.
Conf. Rep. No. 95-1804, p. 26 (1978). The Act does authorize up to a
$500 civil fine for "[a]ny person who otherwise violates" the Act or its
implementing regulations. 16 U. S. C. $ 1540(a)(1). That provision is
potentially sweeping, but it would be so with or without the Secretary's
"harm" regulation, making it unhelpful in assessing the reasonableness of
the regulation. We have imputed scienter requirements to criminal statutes that impose sanctions without expressly requiring scienter, see, e. g.,
Staples v. United States, 511 U. S. 600 (1994), but the proper case in which
we might consider whether to do so in the $ 9 provision for a $500 civil
penalty would be a challenge to enforcement of that provision itself, not a
challenge to a regulation that merely defines a statutory term. We do
not agree with the dissent that the regulation covers results that are not
"even foreseeable . . . no matter how long the chain of causality between
modification and injury." Post, at 715. Respondents have suggested no
reason why either the "knowingly violates" or the "otherwise violates"
provision of the statute--or the "harm" regulation itself--should not be

Opinion of the Court
the lands on which the survival of the species depends. TheSecretary, on the other hand, submits that the $ 9 prohibition

on takings, which Congress defined to include "harm," placeson respondents a duty to avoid harm that habitat alteration
will cause the birds unless respondents first obtain a permitpursuant to $ 10.

The text of the Act provides three reasons for concludingthat the Secretary's interpretation is reasonable. First, an
ordinary understanding of the word "harm" supports it.The dictionary definition of the verb form of "harm" is "to
cause hurt or damage to: injure." Webster's Third New In-ternational Dictionary 1034 (1966). In the context of the
ESA, that definition naturally encompasses habitat modifi-cation that results in actual injury or death to members of
an endangered or threatened species.Respondents argue that the Secretary should have limited
the purview of "harm" to direct applications of force againstprotected species, but the dictionary definition does not include the word "directly" or suggest in any way that onlydirect or willful action that leads to injury constitutes
"harm." 10 Moreover, unless the statutory term "harm" enread to incorporate ordinary requirements of proximate causation and
foreseeability. In any event, neither respondents nor their amici have
suggested that the Secretary employs the "otherwise violates" provision
with any frequency.

10 Respondents and the dissent emphasize what they portray as the "established meaning" of "take" in the sense of a "wildlife take," a meaning
respondents argue extends only to "the effort to exercise dominion over
some creature, and the concrete effect of [sic] that creature." Brief for
Respondents 19; see post, at 717-718. This limitation ill serves the statutory text, which forbids not taking "some creature" but "tak[ing] any [endangered] species"--a formidable task for even the most rapacious feudal
lord. More importantly, Congress explicitly defined the operative term
"take" in the ESA, no matter how much the dissent wishes otherwise, see
post, at 717-720, 722-723, thereby obviating the need for us to probe its
meaning as we must probe the meaning of the undefined subsidiary term
"harm." Finally, Congress' definition of "take" includes several words--

compasses indirect as well as direct injuries, the word hasno meaning that does not duplicate the meaning of other

words that $ 3 uses to define "take." A reluctance to treatstatutory terms as surplusage supports the reasonableness
of the Secretary's interpretation. See, e. g., Mackey v. Lanier Collection Agency & Service, Inc., 486 U. S. 825, 837,and n. 11 (1988).

11

Second, the broad purpose of the ESA supports the Secre-tary's decision to extend protection against activities that

cause the precise harms Congress enacted the statute toavoid. In TVA v. Hill, 437 U. S. 153 (1978), we described
the Act as "the most comprehensive legislation for the pres-ervation of endangered species ever enacted by any nation."
Id., at 180. Whereas predecessor statutes enacted in 1966and 1969 had not contained any sweeping prohibition against
the taking of endangered species except on federal lands, see
id., at 175, the 1973 Act applied to all land in the UnitedStates and to the Nation's territorial seas. As stated in $ 2

of the Act, among its central purposes is "to provide a meanswhereby the ecosystems upon which endangered species and
threatened species depend may be conserved . . . ." 16U. S. C. $ 1531(b).

most obviously "harass," "pursue," and "wound," in addition to "harm"
itself--that fit respondents' and the dissent's definition of "take" no better
than does "significant habitat modification or degradation."

11 In contrast, if the statutory term "harm" encompasses such indirect

means of killing and injuring wildlife as habitat modification, the other
terms listed in $ 3--"harass," "pursue," "hunt," "shoot," "wound," "kill,"
"trap," "capture," and "collect"--generally retain independent meanings.
Most of those terms refer to deliberate actions more frequently than does
"harm," and they therefore do not duplicate the sense of indirect causation
that "harm" adds to the statute. In addition, most of the other words in
the definition describe either actions from which habitat modification does
not usually result (e. g., "pursue," "harass") or effects to which activities
that modify habitat do not usually lead (e. g., "trap," "collect"). To the
extent the Secretary's definition of "harm" may have applications that
overlap with other words in the definition, that overlap reflects the broad
purpose of the Act. See infra this page and 699-700.

Opinion of the Court
In Hill, we construed $ 7 as precluding the completion of
the Tellico Dam because of its predicted impact on the survival of the snail darter. See 437 U. S., at 193. Both our
holding and the language in our opinion stressed the importance of the statutory policy. "The plain intent of Congress
in enacting this statute," we recognized, "was to halt and
reverse the trend toward species extinction, whatever the
cost. This is reflected not only in the stated policies of the
Act, but in literally every section of the statute." Id., at
184. Although the $ 9 "take" prohibition was not at issue
in Hill, we took note of that prohibition, placing particular
emphasis on the Secretary's inclusion of habitat modification
in his definition of "harm." 12 In light of that provision for
habitat protection, we could "not understand how TVA intends to operate Tellico Dam without `harming' the snail
darter." Id., at 184, n. 30. Congress' intent to provide comprehensive protection for endangered and threatened species supports the permissibility of the Secretary's "harm"
regulation.

Respondents advance strong arguments that activities
that cause minimal or unforeseeable harm will not violate the
Act as construed in the "harm" regulation. Respondents,
however, present a facial challenge to the regulation. Cf.
Anderson v. Edwards, 514 U. S. 143, 155-156, n. 6 (1995); INS
v. National Center for Immigrants' Rights, Inc., 502 U. S.
183, 188 (1991). Thus, they ask us to invalidate the Secretary's understanding of "harm" in every circumstance, even
when an actor knows that an activity, such as draining a

12 We stated: "The Secretary of the Interior has defined the term `harm'
to mean `an act or omission which actually injures or kills wildlife, including acts which annoy it to such an extent as to significantly disrupt essential behavioral patterns, which include, but are not limited to, breeding,
feeding or sheltering; significant environmental modification or degradation which has such effects is included within the meaning of "harm." ' "

pond, would actually result in the extinction of a listed spe-cies by destroying its habitat. Given Congress' clear expression of the ESA's broad purpose to protect endangered andthreatened wildlife, the Secretary's definition of "harm" is
reasonable.13Third, the fact that Congress in 1982 authorized the Secretary to issue permits for takings that $ 9(a)(1)(B) would otherwise prohibit, "if such taking is incidental to, and not thepurpose of, the carrying out of an otherwise lawful activity,"

16 U. S. C. $ 1539(a)(1)(B), strongly suggests that Congressunderstood $ 9(a)(1)(B) to prohibit indirect as well as deliberate takings. Cf. NLRB v. Bell Aerospace Co., 416 U. S. 267,274-275 (1974). The permit process requires the applicant
to prepare a "conservation plan" that specifies how he in-tends to "minimize and mitigate" the "impact" of his activity on endangered and threatened species, 16 U. S. C.

$ 1539(a)(2)(A), making clear that Congress had in mind foreseeable rather than merely accidental effects on listed species.14 No one could seriously request an "incidental" take

13 The dissent incorrectly asserts that the Secretary's regulation (1) "dispenses with the foreseeability of harm" and (2) "fail[s] to require injury to
particular animals," post, at 731. As to the first assertion, the regulation
merely implements the statute, and it is therefore subject to the statute's
"knowingly violates" language, see 16 U. S. C. $$ 1540(a)(1), (b)(1), and ordinary requirements of proximate causation and foreseeability. See n. 9,
supra. Nothing in the regulation purports to weaken those requirements. To the contrary, the word "actually" in the regulation should be
construed to limit the liability about which the dissent appears most concerned, liability under the statute's "otherwise violates" provision. See
n. 9, supra; post, at 721-722, 732-733. The Secretary did not need to
include "actually" to connote "but for" causation, which the other words
in the definition obviously require. As to the dissent's second assertion,
every term in the regulation's definition of "harm" is subservient to the
phrase "an act which actually kills or injures wildlife."

14 The dissent acknowledges the legislative history's clear indication that

the drafters of the 1982 amendment had habitat modification in mind, see
post, at 730, but argues that the text of the amendment requires a contrary
conclusion. This argument overlooks the statute's requirement of a "con515us3$88i 08-18-98 09:04:45 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
permit to avert $ 9 liability for direct, deliberate actionagainst a member of an endangered or threatened species,

but respondents would read "harm" so narrowly that thepermit procedure would have little more than that absurd
purpose. "When Congress acts to amend a statute, we pre-sume it intends its amendment to have real and substantial
effect." Stone v. INS, 514 U. S. 386, 397 (1995). Congress'addition of the $ 10 permit provision supports the Secretary's
conclusion that activities not intended to harm an endan-gered species, such as habitat modification, may constitute
unlawful takings under the ESA unless the Secretary per-mits them.

The Court of Appeals made three errors in asserting that"harm" must refer to a direct application of force because the
words around it do.15 First, the court's premise was flawed.Several of the words that accompany "harm" in the $ 3 definition of "take," especially "harass," "pursue," "wound," and"kill," refer to actions or effects that do not require direct
applications of force. Second, to the extent the court read arequirement of intent or purpose into the words used to define "take," it ignored $ 11's express provision that a "knowservation plan," which must describe an alternative to a known, but undesired, habitat modification.

15 The dissent makes no effort to defend the Court of Appeals' reading

of the statutory definition as requiring a direct application of force. Instead, it tries to impose on $ 9 a limitation of liability to "affirmative conduct intentionally directed against a particular animal or animals." Post,
at 720. Under the dissent's interpretation of the Act, a developer could
drain a pond, knowing that the act would extinguish an endangered species of turtles, without even proposing a conservation plan or applying for
a permit under $ 10(a)(1)(B); unless the developer was motivated by a desire "to get at a turtle," post, at 721, no statutory taking could occur.
Because such conduct would not constitute a taking at common law, the
dissent would shield it from $ 9 liability, even though the words "kill" and
"harm" in the statutory definition could apply to such deliberate conduct.
We cannot accept that limitation. In any event, our reasons for rejecting
the Court of Appeals' interpretation apply as well to the dissent's novel
construction.

in[g]" action is enough to violate the Act. Third, the courtemployed noscitur a sociis to give "harm" essentially the

same function as other words in the definition, thereby deny-ing it independent meaning. The canon, to the contrary,
counsels that a word "gathers meaning from the wordsaround it."

Jarecki v. G. D. Searle & Co., 367 U. S. 303, 307(1961). The statutory context of "harm" suggests that Congress meant that term to serve a particular function in theESA, consistent with, but distinct from, the functions of the
other verbs used to define "take." The Secretary's inter-pretation of "harm" to include indirectly injuring endangered animals through habitat modification permissibly in-terprets "harm" to have "a character of its own not to be
submerged by its association." Russell Motor Car Co. v.
United States, 261 U. S. 514, 519 (1923).16Nor does the Act's inclusion of the $ 5 land acquisition authority and the $ 7 directive to federal agencies to avoid de-struction or adverse modification of critical habitat alter our
conclusion. Respondents' argument that the Governmentlacks any incentive to purchase land under $ 5 when it can
simply prohibit takings under $ 9 ignores the practical con-siderations that attend enforcement of the ESA. Purchasing habitat lands may well cost the Government less in manycircumstances than pursuing civil or criminal penalties. In
addition, the $ 5 procedure allows for protection of habitatbefore the seller's activity has harmed any endangered ani16 Respondents' reliance on United States v. Hayashi, 22 F. 3d 859 (CA9
1993), is also misplaced. Hayashi construed the term "harass," part of
the definition of "take" in the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, 16
U. S. C. $ 1361 et seq., as requiring a "direct intrusion" on wildlife to support a criminal prosecution. 22 F. 3d, at 864. Hayashi dealt with a challenge to a single application of a statute whose "take" definition includes
neither "harm" nor several of the other words that appear in the ESA
definition. Moreover, Hayashi was decided by a panel of the Ninth Circuit, the same court that had previously upheld the regulation at issue
here in Palila II, 852 F. 2d 1106 (1988). Neither the Hayashi majority
nor the dissent saw any need to distinguish or even to cite Palila II.

mal, whereas the Government cannot enforce the $ 9 prohibi-tion until an animal has actually been killed or injured. The

Secretary may also find the $ 5 authority useful for prevent-ing modification of land that is not yet but may in the future
become habitat for an endangered or threatened species.The $ 7 directive applies only to the Federal Government,
whereas the $ 9 prohibition applies to "any person." Section7 imposes a broad, affirmative duty to avoid adverse habitat
modifications that $ 9 does not replicate, and $ 7 does notlimit its admonition to habitat modification that "actually
kills or injures wildlife." Conversely, $ 7 contains limita-tions that $ 9 does not, applying only to actions "likely to
jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered speciesor threatened species," 16 U. S. C. $ 1536(a)(2), and to modifications of habitat that has been designated "critical" pursu-ant to $ 4, 16 U. S. C. $ 1533(b)(2).

17 Any overlap that $ 5 or

$ 7 may have with $ 9 in particular cases is unexceptional,see,

e. g., Russello v. United States, 464 U. S. 16, 24, and n. 2(1983), and simply reflects the broad purpose of the Act set

out in $ 2 and acknowledged in TVA v. Hill.We need not decide whether the statutory definition of
"take" compels the Secretary's interpretation of "harm," be-cause our conclusions that Congress did not unambiguously
manifest its intent to adopt respondents' view and that theSecretary's interpretation is reasonable suffice to decide this
case. See generally Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Re-sources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984). The latitude the ESA gives the Secretary in enforcing the statute,together with the degree of regulatory expertise necessary
to its enforcement, establishes that we owe some degree ofdeference to the Secretary's reasonable interpretation. See

Our conclusion that the Secretary's definition of "harm"rests on a permissible construction of the ESA gains further

support from the legislative history of the statute. TheCommittee Reports accompanying the bills that became the
ESA do not specifically discuss the meaning of "harm," butthey make clear that Congress intended "take" to apply
broadly to cover indirect as well as purposeful actions. TheSenate Report stressed that " `[t]ake' is defined . . . in the
broadest possible manner to include every conceivable wayin which a person can `take' or attempt to `take' any fish or
wildlife." S. Rep. No. 93-307, p. 7 (1973). The House Re-port stated that "the broadest possible terms" were used to
define restrictions on takings. H. R. Rep. No. 93-412, p. 15(1973). The House Report underscored the breadth of the

18 Respondents also argue that the rule of lenity should foreclose any
deference to the Secretary's interpretation of the ESA because the statute
includes criminal penalties. The rule of lenity is premised on two ideas:
First, " `a fair warning should be given to the world in language that the
common world will understand, of what the law intends to do if a certain
line is passed' "; second, "legislatures and not courts should define criminal
activity." United States v. Bass, 404 U. S. 336, 347-350 (1971) (quoting
McBoyle v. United States, 283 U. S. 25, 27 (1931)). We have applied the
rule of lenity in a case raising a narrow question concerning the application of a statute that contains criminal sanctions to a specific factual dispute--whether pistols with short barrels and attachable shoulder stocks
are short-barreled rifles--where no regulation was present. See United
States v. Thompson/Center Arms Co., 504 U. S. 505, 517-518, and n. 9
(1992). We have never suggested that the rule of lenity should provide
the standard for reviewing facial challenges to administrative regulations
whenever the governing statute authorizes criminal enforcement. Even
if there exist regulations whose interpretations of statutory criminal penalties provide such inadequate notice of potential liability as to offend the
rule of lenity, the "harm" regulation, which has existed for two decades
and gives a fair warning of its consequences, cannot be one of them.

"take" definition by noting that it included "harassment,
whether intentional or not." Id., at 11 (emphasis added).
The Report explained that the definition "would allow, forexample, the Secretary to regulate or prohibit the activities

of birdwatchers where the effect of those activities might
disturb the birds and make it difficult for them to hatch orraise their young."

Ibid. These comments, ignored in the
dissent's welcome but selective foray into legislative history,see

post, at 726-729, support the Secretary's interpretation
that the term "take" in $ 9 reached far more than the deliber-ate actions of hunters and trappers.

Two endangered species bills, S. 1592 and S. 1983, were
introduced in the Senate and referred to the Commerce Committee. Neither bill included the word "harm" in its definition of "take," although the definitions otherwise closely resembled the one that appeared in the bill as ultimately
enacted. See Hearings on S. 1592 and S. 1983 before the
Subcommittee on Environment of the Senate Committee on
Commerce, 93d Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 7, 27 (1973) (hereinafter
Hearings). Senator Tunney, the floor manager of the bill in
the Senate, subsequently introduced a floor amendment that
added "harm" to the definition, noting that this and accompanying amendments would "help to achieve the purposes of
the bill." 119 Cong. Rec. 25683 (1973). Respondents argue
that the lack of debate about the amendment that added
"harm" counsels in favor of a narrow interpretation. We
disagree. An obviously broad word that the Senate went
out of its way to add to an important statutory definition is
precisely the sort of provision that deserves a respectful
reading.

The definition of "take" that originally appeared in S. 1983
differed from the definition as ultimately enacted in one
other significant respect: It included "the destruction, modification, or curtailment of [the] habitat or range" of fish and
wildlife. Hearings, at 27. Respondents make much of the
fact that the Commerce Committee removed this phrase

Opinion of the Court

from the "take" definition before S. 1983 went to the floor.See 119 Cong. Rec. 25663 (1973). We do not find that fact

especially significant. The legislative materials contain noindication why the habitat protection provision was deleted.
That provision differed greatly from the regulation at issuetoday. Most notably, the habitat protection provision in
S. 1983 would have applied far more broadly than the regu-lation does because it made adverse habitat modification a
categorical violation of the "take" prohibition, unbounded bythe regulation's limitation to habitat modifications that actually kill or injure wildlife. The S. 1983 language also failedto qualify "modification" with the regulation's limiting adjective "significant." We do not believe the Senate's unelabo-rated disavowal of the provision in S. 1983 undermines the
reasonableness of the more moderate habitat protection inthe Secretary's "harm" regulation.

19 Respondents place heavy reliance for their argument that Congress
intended the $ 5 land acquisition provision and not $ 9 to be the ESA's
remedy for habitat modification on a floor statement by Senator Tunney:

"Many species have been inadvertently exterminated by a negligent destruction of their habitat. Their habitats have been cut in size, polluted,
or otherwise altered so that they are unsuitable environments for natural
populations of fish and wildlife. Under this bill, we can take steps to
make amends for our negligent encroachment. The Secretary would be
empowered to use the land acquisition authority granted to him in certain
existing legislation to acquire land for the use of the endangered species
programs. . . . Through these land acquisition provisions, we will be able
to conserve habitats necessary to protect fish and wildlife from further
destruction.

"Although most endangered species are threatened primarily by the destruction of their natural habitats, a significant portion of these animals
are subject to predation by man for commercial, sport, consumption, or
other purposes. The provisions in S. 1983 would prohibit the commerce
in or the importation, exportation, or taking of endangered species . . . ."
119 Cong. Rec. 25669 (1973).

Similarly, respondents emphasize a floor statement by Representative
Sullivan, the House floor manager for the ESA:

"For the most part, the principal threat to animals stems from destruction of their habitat. . . . H. R. 37 will meet this problem by providing

707Cite as: 515 U. S. 687 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
The history of the 1982 amendment that gave the Secre-tary authority to grant permits for "incidental" takings provides further support for his reading of the Act. The HouseReport expressly states that "[b]y use of the word `incidental' the Committee intends to cover situations in which it isknown that a taking will occur if the other activity is engaged in but such taking is incidental to, and not the purposeof, the activity." H. R. Rep. No. 97-567, p. 31 (1982). This
reference to the foreseeability of incidental takings under-mines respondents' argument that the 1982 amendment covered only accidental killings of endangered and threatenedanimals that might occur in the course of hunting or trapping
other animals. Indeed, Congress had habitat modificationdirectly in mind: Both the Senate Report and the House Conference Report identified as the model for the permit processa cooperative state-federal response to a case in California
where a development project threatened incidental harm to aspecies of endangered butterfly by modification of its habitat.
See S. Rep. No. 97-418, p. 10 (1982); H. R. Conf. Rep. No.97-835, pp. 30-32 (1982). Thus, Congress in 1982 focused
squarely on the aspect of the "harm" regulation at issue inthis litigation. Congress' implementation of a permit profunds for acquisition of critical habitat . . . . It will also enable the Department of Agriculture to cooperate with willing landowners who desire to
assist in the protection of endangered species, but who are understandably
unwilling to do so at excessive cost to themselves.

"Another hazard to endangered species arises from those who would
capture or kill them for pleasure or profit. There is no way that Congress
can make it less pleasurable for a person to take an animal, but we can
certainly make it less profitable for them to do so." Id., at 30162.

Each of these statements merely explained features of the bills that
Congress eventually enacted in $ 5 of the ESA and went on to discuss
elements enacted in $ 9. Neither statement even suggested that $ 5 would
be the Act's exclusive remedy for habitat modification by private landowners or that habitat modification by private landowners stood outside the
ambit of $ 9. Respondents' suggestion that these statements identified $ 5
as the ESA's only response to habitat modification contradicts their emphasis elsewhere on the habitat protections in $ 7. See supra, at 702-703.

gram is consistent with the Secretary's interpretation of theterm "harm."

IV
When it enacted the ESA, Congress delegated broad ad-ministrative and interpretive power to the Secretary. See

16 U. S. C. $$ 1533, 1540(f ). The task of defining and listingendangered and threatened species requires an expertise and
attention to detail that exceeds the normal province of Con-gress. Fashioning appropriate standards for issuing permits under $ 10 for takings that would otherwise violate $ 9necessarily requires the exercise of broad discretion. The
proper interpretation of a term such as "harm" involves acomplex policy choice. When Congress has entrusted the
Secretary with broad discretion, we are especially reluctantto substitute our views of wise policy for his. See

Chevron,467 U. S., at 865-866. In this case, that reluctance accords

with our conclusion, based on the text, structure, and legisla-tive history of the ESA, that the Secretary reasonably construed the intent of Congress when he defined "harm" toinclude "significant habitat modification or degradation that
actually kills or injures wildlife."In the elaboration and enforcement of the ESA, the Secretary and all persons who must comply with the law will con-front difficult questions of proximity and degree; for, as all
recognize, the Act encompasses a vast range of economic andsocial enterprises and endeavors. These questions must be
addressed in the usual course of the law, through case-by-case resolution and adjudication.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.

It is so ordered.
Justice O'Connor, concurring.
My agreement with the Court is founded on two under-standings. First, the challenged regulation is limited to significant habitat modification that causes actual, as opposed

709Cite as: 515 U. S. 687 (1995)
O'Connor, J., concurring
to hypothetical or speculative, death or injury to identifiableprotected animals. Second, even setting aside difficult questions of scienter, the regulation's application is limited byordinary principles of proximate causation, which introduce
notions of foreseeability. These limitations, in my view, call
into question Palila v. Hawaii Dept. of Land and Natural
Resources, 852 F. 2d 1106 (CA9 1988) (Palila II), and with
it, many of the applications derided by the dissent. Becausethere is no need to strike a regulation on a facial challenge

out of concern that it is susceptible of erroneous application,however, and because there are many habitat-related circumstances in which the regulation might validly apply, I join
the opinion of the Court.

In my view, the regulation is limited by its terms to
actions that actually kill or injure individual animals. Justice Scalia disagrees, arguing that the harm regulation
"encompasses injury inflicted, not only upon individual animals, but upon populations of the protected species." Post,
at 716. At one level, I could not reasonably quarrel with
this observation; death to an individual animal always reduces the size of the population in which it lives, and in that
sense, "injures" that population. But by its insight, the dissent means something else. Building upon the regulation's
use of the word "breeding," Justice Scalia suggests that
the regulation facially bars significant habitat modification
that actually kills or injures hypothetical animals (or, perhaps more aptly, causes potential additions to the population
not to come into being). Because "[i]mpairment of breeding
does not `injure' living creatures," Justice Scalia reasons,
the regulation must contemplate application to "a population of animals which would otherwise have maintained or
increased its numbers." Post, at 716, 734.

I disagree. As an initial matter, I do not find it as easy
as Justice Scalia does to dismiss the notion that significant
impairment of breeding injures living creatures. To raze
the last remaining ground on which the piping plover cur515us3$88j 08-18-98 09:04:45 PAGES OPINPGT

rently breeds, thereby making it impossible for any pipingplovers to reproduce, would obviously injure the population

(causing the species' extinction in a generation). But bycompletely preventing breeding, it would also injure the
individual living bird, in the same way that sterilizing the
creature injures the individual living bird. To "injure"is, among other things, "to impair." Webster's Ninth New

Collegiate Dictionary 623 (1983). One need not subscribe totheories of "psychic harm," cf.

post, at 734-735, n. 5, to recognize that to make it impossible for an animal to reproduce isto impair its most essential physical functions and to render

that animal, and its genetic material, biologically obsolete.
This, in my view, is actual injury.

In any event, even if impairing an animal's ability to breed
were not, in and of itself, an injury to that animal, interference with breeding can cause an animal to suffer other, perhaps more obvious, kinds of injury. The regulation has clear
application, for example, to significant habitat modification
that kills or physically injures animals which, because they
are in a vulnerable breeding state, do not or cannot flee or
defend themselves, or to environmental pollutants that cause
an animal to suffer physical complications during gestation.
Breeding, feeding, and sheltering are what animals do. If
significant habitat modification, by interfering with these
essential behaviors, actually kills or injures an animal
protected by the Act, it causes "harm" within the meaning
of the regulation. In contrast to Justice Scalia, I do not
read the regulation's "breeding" reference to vitiate or
somehow to qualify the clear actual death or injury requirement, or to suggest that the regulation contemplates extension to nonexistent animals.

There is no inconsistency, I should add, between this interpretation and the commentary that accompanied the amendment of the regulation to include the actual death or injury
requirement. See 46 Fed. Reg. 54748 (1981). Quite the
contrary. It is true, as Justice Scalia observes, post, at 716,

that the Fish and Wildlife Service states at one point that"harm" is not limited to "direct physical injury to an individual member of the wildlife species," see 46 Fed. Reg. 54748(1981). But one could just as easily emphasize the word "direct" in this sentence as the word "individual." * Elsewherein the commentary, the Service makes clear that "section 9's
threshold does focus on individual members of a protectedspecies."

Id., at 54749. Moreover, the Service says thatthe regulation has no application to speculative harm, explaining that its insertion of the word "actually" was in-tended "to bulwark the need for proven injury to a species
due to a party's actions." Ibid.; see also ibid. (approvinglanguage that "[h]arm covers actions . . . which actually (as
opposed to potentially), cause injury"). That a protected an-imal could have eaten the leaves of a fallen tree or could,
perhaps, have fruitfully multiplied in its branches is not sufficient under the regulation. Instead, as the commentaryreflects, the regulation requires demonstrable effect (

i. e.,
actual injury or death) on actual, individual members of
the protected species.By the dissent's reckoning, the regulation at issue here, in

conjunction with 16 U. S. C. $ 1540(a)(1), imposes liability forany habitat-modifying conduct that ultimately results in the
death of a protected animal, "regardless of whether that re-sult is intended or even foreseeable, and no matter how long

*Justice Scalia suggests that, if the word "direct" merits emphasis in
this sentence, then the sentence should be read as an effort to negate
principles of proximate causation. See post, at 734-735, n. 5. As this
case itself demonstrates, however, the word "direct" is susceptible of many
meanings. The Court of Appeals, for example, used "direct" to suggest
an element of purposefulness. See 17 F. 3d 1463, 1465 (CADC 1994). So,
occasionally, does the dissent. See post, at 720 (describing "affirmative acts
. . . which are directed immediately and intentionally against a particular
animal") (emphasis added). It is not hard to imagine conduct that, while
"indirect" (i. e., nonpurposeful), proximately causes actual death or injury
to individual protected animals, cf. post, at 732; indeed, principles of proximate cause routinely apply in the negligence and strict liability contexts.

the chain of causality between modification and injury."
Post, at 715; see also post, at 719. Even if $ 1540(a)(1) does
create a strict liability regime (a question we need not decideat this juncture), I see no indication that Congress, in enacting that section, intended to dispense with ordinary principles of proximate causation. Strict liability means liabilitywithout regard to fault; it does not normally mean liability

for every consequence, however remote, of one's conduct.See generally W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen,
Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts 559-560 (5th ed. 1984)(describing "practical necessity for the restriction of liability
within some reasonable bounds" in the strict liability context). I would not lightly assume that Congress, in enacting
a strict liability statute that is silent on the causation question, has dispensed with this well-entrenched principle. In
the absence of congressional abrogation of traditional principles of causation, then, private parties should be held liable
under $ 1540(a)(1) only if their habitat-modifying actions
proximately cause death or injury to protected animals. Cf.
Benefiel v. Exxon Corp., 959 F. 2d 805, 807-808 (CA9 1992)
(in enacting the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act,
which provides for strict liability for damages that are the
result of discharges, Congress did not intend to abrogate
common-law principles of proximate cause to reach "remote
and derivative" consequences); New York v. Shore Realty
Corp., 759 F. 2d 1032, 1044, and n. 17 (CA2 1985) (noting that
"[t]raditional tort law has often imposed strict liability while
recognizing a causation defense," but that, in enacting the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation,
and Liability Act of 1980, Congress "specifically rejected
including a causation requirement"). The regulation, of
course, does not contradict the presumption or notion that
ordinary principles of causation apply here. Indeed, by use
of the word "actually," the regulation clearly rejects speculative or conjectural effects, and thus itself invokes principles
of proximate causation.

Proximate causation is not a concept susceptible of pre-cise definition. See Keeton,

supra, at 280-281. It is easy
enough, of course, to identify the extremes. The farmerwhose fertilizer is lifted by a tornado from tilled fields and

deposited miles away in a wildlife refuge cannot, by any
stretch of the term, be considered the proximate cause ofdeath or injury to protected species occasioned thereby. At

the same time, the landowner who drains a pond on his prop-erty, killing endangered fish in the process, would likely satisfy any formulation of the principle. We have recently saidthat proximate causation "normally eliminates the bizarre,"
Jerome B. Grubart, Inc. v. Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co.,
513 U. S. 527, 536 (1995), and have noted its "functionally
equivalent" alternative characterizations in terms of foreseeability, see Milwaukee & St. Paul R. Co. v. Kellogg, 94 U. S.
469, 475 (1877) ("natural and probable consequence"), and
duty, see Palsgraf v. Long Island R. Co., 248 N. Y. 339, 162
N. E. 99 (1928). Consolidated Rail Corporation v. Gottshall, 512 U. S. 532, 546 (1994). Proximate causation depends to a great extent on considerations of the fairness of
imposing liability for remote consequences. The task of determining whether proximate causation exists in the limitless fact patterns sure to arise is best left to lower courts.
But I note, at the least, that proximate cause principles inject a foreseeability element into the statute, and hence, the
regulation, that would appear to alleviate some of the problems noted by the dissent. See, e. g., post, at 719 (describing
"a farmer who tills his field and causes erosion that makes
silt run into a nearby river which depletes oxygen and
thereby [injures] protected fish").

In my view, then, the "harm" regulation applies where significant habitat modification, by impairing essential behaviors, proximately (foreseeably) causes actual death or injury
to identifiable animals that are protected under the Endangered Species Act. Pursuant to my interpretation, Palila
II--under which the Court of Appeals held that a state

agency committed a "taking" by permitting mouflon sheepto eat mamane-naio seedlings that, when full grown, might

have fed and sheltered endangered palila--was wrongly de-cided according to the regulation's own terms. Destruction
of the seedlings did not proximately cause actual death or
injury to identifiable birds; it merely prevented the regener-ation of forest land not currently sustaining actual birds.

This case, of course, comes to us as a facial challenge. Weare charged with deciding whether the regulation on its face
exceeds the agency's statutory mandate. I have identifiedat least one application of the regulation

(Palila II) that is,
in my view, inconsistent with the regulation's own limita-tions. That misapplication does not, however, call into question the validity of the regulation itself. One can doubtless
imagine questionable applications of the regulation that test
the limits of the agency's authority. However, it seems to
me clear that the regulation does not on its terms exceed the
agency's mandate, and that the regulation has innumerable
valid habitat-related applications. Congress may, of course,
see fit to revisit this issue. And nothing the Court says
today prevents the agency itself from narrowing the scope
of its regulation at a later date.

With this understanding, I join the Court's opinion.

Justice Scalia, with whom The Chief Justice and
Justice Thomas join, dissenting.

I think it unmistakably clear that the legislation at issue
here (1) forbade the hunting and killing of endangered animals, and (2) provided federal lands and federal funds for
the acquisition of private lands, to preserve the habitat of
endangered animals. The Court's holding that the hunting
and killing prohibition incidentally preserves habitat on
private lands imposes unfairness to the point of financial
ruin--not just upon the rich, but upon the simplest farmer
who finds his land conscripted to national zoological use.
I respectfully dissent.

The Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), 16 U. S. C.$ 1531

et seq. (1988 ed. and Supp. V), provides that "it is un-lawful for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United

States to--. . . take any [protected] species within theUnited States." $ 1538(a)(1)(B). The term "take" is defined as "to harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill,trap, capture, or collect, or to attempt to engage in any such
conduct." $ 1532(19) (emphasis added). The challengedregulation defines "harm" thus:

"Harm in the definition of `take' in the Act means anact which actually kills or injures wildlife. Such act
may include significant habitat modification or degrada-tion where it actually kills or injures wildlife by significantly impairing essential behavioral patterns, includingbreeding, feeding or sheltering." 50 CFR $ 17.3 (1994).

In my view petitioners must lose--the regulation must fall--even under the test of

Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Re-sources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 843 (1984), so I

shall assume that the Court is correct to apply Chevron.See ante, at 703-704, and n. 18.

The regulation has three features which, for reasons Ishall discuss at length below, do not comport with the statute. First, it interprets the statute to prohibit habitat modi-fication that is no more than the cause-in-fact of death or
injury to wildlife. Any "significant habitat modification"that in fact produces that result by "impairing essential behavioral patterns" is made unlawful, regardless of whetherthat result is intended or even foreseeable, and no matter
how long the chain of causality between modification and in-jury. See, e. g., Palila v. Hawaii Dept. of Land and Natural
Resources, 852 F. 2d 1106, 1108-1109 (CA9 1988) (Palila II)(sheep grazing constituted "taking" of palila birds, since

full-grown trees, on which the palila feeds and nests). Seealso Davison, Alteration of Wildlife Habitat as a Prohibited

Taking under the Endangered Species Act, 10 J. Land Use& Envtl. L. 155, 190 (1995) (regulation requires only
causation-in-fact).

Second, the regulation does not require an "act": The Sec-retary's officially stated position is that an

omission will do.
The previous version of the regulation made this explicit.See 40 Fed. Reg. 44412, 44416 (1975) (" `Harm' in the definition of `take' in the Act means an act or omission which actu-ally kills or injures wildlife . . ."). When the regulation was
modified in 1981 the phrase "or omission" was taken out, but
only because (as the final publication of the rule advised)
"the [Fish and Wildlife] Service feels that `act' is inclusive
of either commissions or omissions which would be prohibited by section [1538(a)(1)(B)]." 46 Fed. Reg. 54748, 54750
(1981). In their brief here petitioners agree that the
regulation covers omissions, see Brief for Petitioners 47
(although they argue that "[a]n `omission' constitutes an
`act' . . . only if there is a legal duty to act"), ibid.

The third and most important unlawful feature of the regulation is that it encompasses injury inflicted, not only upon
individual animals, but upon populations of the protected
species. "Injury" in the regulation includes "significantly
impairing essential behavioral patterns, including breeding,"
50 CFR $ 17.3 (1994) (emphasis added). Impairment of
breeding does not "injure" living creatures; it prevents them
from propagating, thus "injuring" a population of animals
which would otherwise have maintained or increased its
numbers. What the face of the regulation shows, the Secretary's official pronouncements confirm. The Final Redefinition of "Harm" accompanying publication of the regulation
said that "harm" is not limited to "direct physical injury to
an individual member of the wildlife species," 46 Fed. Reg.
54748 (1981), and refers to "injury to a population," id., at
54749 (emphasis added). See also Palila II, supra, at 1108;

None of these three features of the regulation can be foundin the statutory provisions supposed to authorize it. The

term "harm" in $ 1532(19) has no legal force of its own. Anindictment or civil complaint that charged the defendant
with "harming" an animal protected under the Act would bedismissed as defective, for the only

operative term in thestatute is to "take." If "take" were not elsewhere defined

in the Act, none could dispute what it means, for the term isas old as the law itself. To "take," when applied to wild
animals, means to reduce those animals, by killing or captur-ing, to human control. See,

e. g., 11 Oxford English Diction-ary (1933) ("Take . . . To catch, capture (a wild beast, bird,

fish, etc.)"); Webster's New International Dictionary of theEnglish Language (2d ed. 1949) (take defined as "to catch
or capture by trapping, snaring, etc., or as prey"); Geer v.Connecticut, 161 U. S. 519, 523 (1896) (" `[A]ll the animals
which can be taken upon the earth, in the sea, or in the air,that is to say, wild animals, belong to those who take them' ")
(quoting the Digest of Justinian); 2 W. Blackstone, Commen-taries 411 (1766) ("Every man . . . has an equal right of pursuing and taking to his own use all such creatures as are ferae
naturae"). This is just the sense in which "take" is usedelsewhere in federal legislation and treaty. See, e. g., Migratory Bird Treaty Act, 16 U. S. C. $ 703 (1988 ed., Supp. V) (noperson may "pursue, hunt, take, capture, kill, [or] attempt to
take, capture, or kill" any migratory bird); Agreement on theConservation of Polar Bears, Nov. 15, 1973, Art. I, 27 U. S. T.
3918, 3921, T. I. A. S. No. 8409 (defining "taking" as "hunting,killing and capturing"). And that meaning fits neatly with
the rest of $ 1538(a)(1), which makes it unlawful not only totake protected species, but also to import or export them,

1 The Court and Justice O'Connor deny that the regulation has the
first or the third of these features. I respond to their arguments in Part
III, infra.

$ 1538(a)(1)(A); to possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, orship any taken species, $ 1538(a)(1)(D); and to transport, sell,

or offer to sell them in interstate or foreign commerce,$$ 1538(a)(1)(E), (F). The taking prohibition, in other
words, is only part of the regulatory plan of $ 1538(a)(1),which covers all the stages of the process by which protected
wildlife is reduced to man's dominion and made the object ofprofit. It is obvious that "take" in this sense--a term of art
deeply embedded in the statutory and common law concern-ing wildlife--describes a class of acts (not omissions) done
directly and intentionally (not indirectly and by accident) toparticular animals (not populations of animals).

The Act's definition of "take" does expand the wordslightly (and not unusually), so as to make clear that it includes not just a completed taking, but the process of taking,and all of the acts that are customarily identified with or
accompany that process ("to harass, harm, pursue, hunt,shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect"); and so as to
include attempts. $ 1532(19). The tempting fallacy--whichthe Court commits with abandon, see

ante, at 697-698,n. 10--is to assume that once defined, "take" loses any

significance, and it is only the definition that matters. TheCourt treats the statute as though Congress had directly
enacted the $ 1532(19) definition as a self-executing prohi-bition, and had not enacted $ 1538(a)(1)(B) at all. But

$ 1538(a)(1)(B) is there, and if the terms contained in thedefinitional section are susceptible of two readings, one of
which comports with the standard meaning of "take" as usedin application to wildlife, and one of which does not, an
agency regulation that adopts the latter reading is necessar-ily unreasonable, for it reads the defined term "take"--the
only operative term--out of the statute altogether.2

2 The Court suggests halfheartedly that "take" cannot refer to the taking of particular animals, because $ 1538(a)(1)(B) prohibits "tak[ing] any
[endangered] species." Ante, at 697, n. 10. The suggestion is halfhearted
because that reading obviously contradicts the statutory intent. It would

That is what has occurred here. The verb "harm" has arange of meaning: "to cause injury" at its broadest, "to do

hurt or damage" in a narrower and more direct sense. See,e. g., 1 N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English
Language (1828) ("Harm, v.t. To hurt; to injure; to damage;
to impair soundness of body, either animal or vegetable")(emphasis added); American College Dictionary 551 (1970)

("harm . . . n. injury; damage; hurt: to do him bodily harm").In fact the more directed sense of "harm" is a somewhat
more common and preferred usage; "harm has in it a littleof the idea of specially focused hurt or injury, as if a personal
injury has been anticipated and intended." J. Opdycke,Mark My Words: A Guide to Modern Usage and Expression
330 (1949). See also American Heritage Dictionary 662(1985) ("

Injure has the widest range. . . . Harm and hurtrefer principally to what causes physical or mental distress

to living things"). To define "harm" as an act or omissionthat, however remotely, "actually kills or injures" a population of wildlife through habitat modification is to choose ameaning that makes nonsense of the word that "harm" defines--requiring us to accept that a farmer who tills his fieldand causes erosion that makes silt run into a nearby river
which depletes oxygen and thereby "impairs [the] breeding"of protected fish has "taken" or "attempted to take" the fish.
It should take the strongest evidence to make us believe thatCongress has defined a term in a manner repugnant to its
ordinary and traditional sense.Here the evidence shows the opposite. "Harm" is merely
one of 10 prohibitory words in $ 1532(19), and the other 9 fitthe ordinary meaning of "take" perfectly. To "harass, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect" are
mean no violation in the intentional shooting of a single bald eagle--or,
for that matter, the intentional shooting of 1,000 bald eagles out of the
extant 1,001. The phrasing of $ 1538(a)(1)(B), as the Court recognizes
elsewhere, see, e. g., ante, at 696, is shorthand for "take any [member of
an endangered] species."

all affirmative acts (the provision itself describes them as"conduct," see $ 1532(19)) which are directed immediately

and intentionally against a particular animal--not acts oromissions that indirectly and accidentally cause injury to a
population of animals. The Court points out that several of
the words ("harass," "pursue," "wound," and "kill") "refer toactions or effects that do not require direct

applications
of force." Ante, at 701 (emphasis added). That is trueenough, but force is not the point. Even "taking" activities

in the narrowest sense, activities traditionally engaged in byhunters and trappers, do not all consist of direct applications
of force; pursuit and harassment are part of the business of"taking" the prey even before it has been touched. What
the nine other words in $ 1532(19) have in common--and
share with the narrower meaning of "harm" described above,but not with the Secretary's ruthless dilation of the word--

is the sense of affirmative conduct intentionally directedagainst a particular animal or animals.

I am not the first to notice this fact, or to draw the conclu-sion that it compels. In 1981 the Solicitor of the Fish and
Wildlife Service delivered a legal opinion on $ 1532(19) thatis in complete agreement with my reading:

"The Act's definition of `take' contains a list of actionsthat illustrate the intended scope of the term . . . . With
the possible exception of `harm,' these terms all repre-sent forms of conduct that are directed against and
likely to injure or kill individual wildlife. Under the
principle of statutory construction, ejusdem generis, . . .the term `harm' should be interpreted to include only

those actions that are directed against, and likely to
injure or kill, individual wildlife." Memorandum of
Apr. 17, reprinted in 46 Fed. Reg. 29490, 29491 (1981)
(emphasis in original).

I would call it noscitur a sociis, but the principle is much the
same: The fact that "several items in a list share an attribute

721Cite as: 515 U. S. 687 (1995)
Scalia, J., dissenting
counsels in favor of interpreting the other items as possess-ing that attribute as well,"

Beecham v. United States, 511
U. S. 368, 371 (1994). The Court contends that the canoncannot be applied to deprive a word of all its "independent

meaning," ante, at 702. That proposition is questionable to
begin with, especially as applied to long lawyers' listingssuch as this. If it were true, we ought to give the word

"trap" in the definition its rare meaning of "to clothe"(whence "trappings")--since otherwise it adds nothing to the
word "capture." See Moskal v. United States, 498 U. S. 103,120 (1990) (

Scalia, J., dissenting). In any event, the Court's
contention that "harm" in the narrow sense adds nothing to
the other words underestimates the ingenuity of our own
species in a way that Congress did not. To feed an animal
poison, to spray it with mace, to chop down the very tree in
which it is nesting, or even to destroy its entire habitat in
order to take it (as by draining a pond to get at a turtle),
might neither wound nor kill, but would directly and intentionally harm.

The penalty provisions of the Act counsel this interpretation as well. Any person who "knowingly" violates $ 1538(a)(1)(B) is subject to criminal penalties under

$ 1540(b)(1) and civil penalties under $ 1540(a)(1); moreover,
under the latter section, any person "who otherwise violates"
the taking prohibition (i. e., violates it unknowingly) may be
assessed a civil penalty of $500 for each violation, with the
stricture that "[e]ach such violation shall be a separate offense." This last provision should be clear warning that the
regulation is in error, for when combined with the regulation
it produces a result that no legislature could reasonably be
thought to have intended: A large number of routine private
activities--for example, farming, ranching, roadbuilding, construction and logging--are subjected to strict-liability penalties when they fortuitously injure protected wildlife, no matter how remote the chain of causation and no matter how
difficult to foresee (or to disprove) the "injury" may be (e. g.,

an "impairment" of breeding). The Court says that "[thestrict-liability provision] is potentially sweeping, but it would

be so with or without the Secretary's `harm' regulation."
Ante, at 696, n. 9. That is not correct. Without the regulation, the routine "habitat modifying" activities that people
conduct to make a daily living would not carry exposure tostrict penalties; only acts directed at animals, like those described by the other words in $ 1532(19), would risk liability.The Court says that "[to] read a requirement of intent or
purpose into the words used to define `take' . . . ignore[s][$ 1540's] express provision that a `knowin[g]' action is
enough to violate the Act." Ante, at 701-702. This presumably means that because the reading of $ 1532(19) advanced here ascribes an element of purposeful injury to the
prohibited acts, it makes superfluous (or inexplicable) the
more severe penalties provided for a "knowing" violation.
That conclusion does not follow, for it is quite possible to take
protected wildlife purposefully without doing so knowingly.
A requirement that a violation be "knowing" means that the
defendant must "know the facts that make his conduct illegal," Staples v. United States, 511 U. S. 600, 606 (1994). The
hunter who shoots an elk in the mistaken belief that it is
a mule deer has not knowingly violated $ 1538(a)(1)(B)--not
because he does not know that elk are legally protected (that
would be knowledge of the law, which is not a requirement,
see ante, at 696-697, n. 9), but because he does not know
what sort of animal he is shooting. The hunter has nonetheless committed a purposeful taking of protected wildlife, and
would therefore be subject to the (lower) strict-liability penalties for the violation.

So far I have discussed only the immediate statutory text
bearing on the regulation. But the definition of "take" in

$ 1532(19) applies "[f]or the purposes of this chapter," that
is, it governs the meaning of the word as used everywhere
in the Act. Thus, the Secretary's interpretation of "harm"
is wrong if it does not fit with the use of "take" throughout

the Act. And it does not. In $ 1540(e)(4)(B), for example,Congress provided for the forfeiture of "[a]ll guns, traps,

nets, and other equipment . . . used to aid the taking, possess-ing, selling, [etc.]" of protected animals. This listing plainly
relates to "taking" in the ordinary sense. If environmental
modification were part (and necessarily a major part) of tak-ing, as the Secretary maintains, one would have expected

the list to include "plows, bulldozers, and backhoes." As an-other example, $ 1539(e)(1) exempts "the taking of any endangered species" by Alaskan Indians and Eskimos "if suchtaking is primarily for subsistence purposes"; and provides
that "[n]on-edible byproducts of species taken pursuant tothis section may be sold . . . when made into authentic native
articles of handicrafts and clothing." Surely these provisions apply to taking only in the ordinary sense, and aremeaningless as applied to species injured by environmental

modification. The Act is full of like examples. See, e. g.,$ 1538(a)(1)(D) (prohibiting possession, sale, and transport of
"species taken in violation" of the Act). "[I]f the Act is tobe interpreted as a symmetrical and coherent regulatory
scheme, one in which the operative words have a consistentmeaning throughout,"

Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., 513 U. S. 561,
569 (1995), the regulation must fall.

The broader structure of the Act confirms the unreason-ableness of the regulation. Section 1536 provides:

"Each Federal agency shall . . . insure that any action
authorized, funded, or carried out by such agency . . . is
not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of anyendangered species or threatened species or

result in
the destruction or adverse modification of habitat of
such species which is determined by the Secretary . . .
to be critical." 16 U. S. C. $ 1536(a)(2) (emphasis added).

The Act defines "critical habitat" as habitat that is "essential
to the conservation of the species," $$ 1532(5)(A)(i), (A)(ii),
with "conservation" in turn defined as the use of methods

necessary to bring listed species "to the point at which themeasures provided pursuant to this chapter are no longer

necessary," $ 1532(3).These provisions have a double significance. Even if

$$ 1536(a)(2) and 1538(a)(1)(B) were totally independent prohibitions--the former applying only to federal agencies andtheir licensees, the latter only to private parties--Congress's

explicit prohibition of habitat modification in the one sectionwould bar the inference of an implicit prohibition of habitat
modification in the other section. "[W]here Congress in-cludes particular language in one section of a statute but
omits it in another . . . , it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion." Keene Corp. v. United States, 508 U. S.
200, 208 (1993) (internal quotation marks omitted). And
that presumption against implicit prohibition would be even
stronger where the one section which uses the language
carefully defines and limits its application. That is to say, it
would be passing strange for Congress carefully to define
"critical habitat" as used in $ 1536(a)(2), but leave it to the
Secretary to evaluate, willy-nilly, impermissible "habitat
modification" (under the guise of "harm") in $ 1538(a)(1)(B).

In fact, however, $$ 1536(a)(2) and 1538(a)(1)(B) do not operate in separate realms; federal agencies are subject to both,
because the "person[s]" forbidden to take protected species
under $ 1538 include agencies and departments of the Federal Government. See $ 1532(13). This means that the
"harm" regulation also contradicts another principle of interpretation: that statutes should be read so far as possible to
give independent effect to all their provisions. See Ratzlaf
v. United States, 510 U. S. 135, 140-141 (1994). By defining
"harm" in the definition of "take" in $ 1538(a)(1)(B) to include
significant habitat modification that injures populations of
wildlife, the regulation makes the habitat-modification restriction in $ 1536(a)(2) almost wholly superfluous. As "critical habitat" is habitat "essential to the conservation of the

species," adverse modification of "critical" habitat by a fed-eral agency would also constitute habitat modification that

injures a population of wildlife.Petitioners try to salvage some independent scope for

$ 1536(a)(2) by the following contortion: Because the def-inition of critical habitat includes not only "the specific
areas within the geographical area occupied by the species[that are] essential to the conservation of the species,"

$ 1532(5)(A)(i), but also "specific areas outside the geographi-cal area occupied by the species at the time it is listed [as a
protected species] . . . [that are] essential to the conservationof the species," $ 1532A(5)(ii), there may be some agency
modifications of critical habitat which do not injure a popula-tion of wildlife. See Brief for Petitioners 41, and n. 27.
This is dubious to begin with. A principal way to injurewildlife under the Secretary's own regulation is to "significantly impai[r] . . . breeding," 50 CFR $ 17.3 (1994). To pre-vent the natural increase of a species by adverse modification
of habitat suitable for expansion assuredly impairs breeding.But even if true, the argument only narrows the scope
of the superfluity, leaving as so many wasted words the$ 1532(a)(5)(i) definition of critical habitat to include currently occupied habitat essential to the species' conservation.If the Secretary's definition of "harm" under $ 1538(a)(1)(B)
is to be upheld, we must believe that Congress enacted$ 1536(a)(2) solely because in its absence federal agencies
would be able to modify habitat in currently unoccupiedareas. It is more rational to believe that the Secretary's
expansion of $ 1538(a)(1)(B) carves out the heart of one of thecentral provisions of the Act.

II
The Court makes four other arguments. First, "thebroad purpose of the [Act] supports the Secretary's decision

to extend protection against activities that cause the preciseharms Congress enacted the statute to avoid." Ante, at 698.

I thought we had renounced the vice of "simplistically . . .assum[ing] that whatever furthers the statute's primary

objective must be the law." Rodriguez v. United States,480 U. S. 522, 526 (1987) (per curiam) (emphasis in original).
Deduction from the "broad purpose" of a statute begs thequestion if it is used to decide by what

means (and henceto what length) Congress pursued that purpose; to get the

right answer to that question there is no substitute for thehard job (or, in this case, the quite simple one) of reading
the whole text. "The Act must do everything necessary toachieve its broad purpose" is the slogan of the enthusiast,
not the analytical tool of the arbiter.3Second, the Court maintains that the legislative history of
the 1973 Act supports the Secretary's definition. See ante,at 704-706. Even if legislative history were a legitimate and
reliable tool of interpretation (which I shall assume in orderto rebut the Court's claim); and even if it could appropriately
be resorted to when the enacted text is as clear as this, butsee

Chicago v. Environmental Defense Fund, 511 U. S. 328,337 (1994); here it shows quite the opposite of what the Court

says. I shall not pause to discuss the Court's reliance onsuch statements in the Committee Reports as " `[t]ake' is defined . . . in the broadest possible manner to include everyconceivable way in which a person can `take' or attempt to
`take' any fish or wildlife.' " S. Rep. No. 93-307, p. 7 (1973)(quoted

ante, at 704). This sort of empty flourish--to theeffect that "this statute means what it means all the way"--

3 This portion of the Court's opinion, see ante, at 699, n. 12, discusses
and quotes a footnote in TVA v. Hill, 437 U. S. 153, 184-185, n. 30 (1978),
in which we described the then-current version of the Secretary's regulation, and said that the habitat modification undertaken by the federal
agency in the case would have violated the regulation. Even if we had
said that the Secretary's regulation was authorized by $ 1538, that would
have been utter dictum, for the only provision at issue was $ 1536. See
id., at 193. But in fact we simply opined on the effect of the regulation
while assuming its validity, just as courts always do with provisions of law
whose validity is not at issue.

counts for little even when enacted into the law itself. SeeReves v. Ernst & Young, 507 U. S. 170, 183-184 (1993).

Much of the Court's discussion of legislative history is de-voted to two items: first, the Senate floor manager's introduction of an amendment that added the word "harm" to thedefinition of "take," with the observation that (along with
other amendments) it would " `help to achieve the purposesof the bill' "; second, the relevant Committee's removal from
the definition of a provision stating that "take" includes" `the destruction, modification or curtailment of [the] habitat
or range' " of fish and wildlife. See ante, at 705. The Courtinflates the first and belittles the second, even though the
second is on its face far more pertinent. But this elaborateinference from various pre-enactment actions and inactions
is quite unnecessary, since we have direct evidence of whatthose who brought the legislation to the floor thought it
meant--evidence as solid as any ever to be found in legisla-tive history, but which the Court banishes to a footnote.
See ante, at 706-707, n. 19.Both the Senate and House floor managers of the bill explained it in terms which leave no doubt that the problem ofhabitat destruction on private lands was to be solved principally by the land acquisition program of $ 1534, while $ 1538solved a different problem altogether--the problem of takings. Senator Tunney stated:

"Through [the] land acquisition provisions, we will beable to conserve habitats necessary to protect fish and

wildlife from further destruction."Although most endangered species are threatened
primarily by the destruction of their natural habitats, asignificant portion of these animals are subject to

preda-tion by man for commercial, sport, consumption, or

other purposes. The provisions of [the bill] would pro-hibit the commerce in or the importation, exportation,
or taking of endangered species . . . ." 119 Cong. Rec.25669 (1973) (emphasis added).

FOR GREAT ORE.

Scalia, J., dissenting

The House floor manager, Representative Sullivan, put thesame thought in this way:

"[T]he principal threat to animals stems from destruc-tion of their habitat. . . .

[The bill] will meet this problem by providing funds for acquisition of critical
habitat. . . . It will also enable the Department of Agriculture to cooperate with willing landowners who desireto assist in the protection of endangered species,

but
who are understandably unwilling to do so at excessive
cost to themselves.

"Another hazard to endangered species arises from
those who would capture or kill them for pleasure or
profit. There is no way that the Congress can make it
less pleasurable for a person to take an animal, but wecan certainly make it less profitable for them to do so."

Id., at 30162 (emphasis added).
Habitat modification and takings, in other words, were
viewed as different problems, addressed by different provi-sions of the Act. The Court really has no explanation for

these statements. All it can say is that "[n]either statementeven suggested that [the habitat acquisition funding provision in $ 1534] would be the Act's exclusive remedy for habi-tat modification by private landowners or that habitat modification by private landowners stood outside the ambit of
[$ 1538]." Ante, at 707, n. 19. That is to say, the state-ments are not as bad as they might have been. Little in

life is. They are, however, quite bad enough to destroy theCourt's legislative-history case, since they display the clear
understanding (1) that habitat modification is separate from
"taking," and (2) that habitat destruction on private lands
is to be remedied by public acquisition, and not by making
particular unlucky landowners incur "excessive cost to themselves." The Court points out triumphantly that they do
not display the understanding (3) that the land acquisition
program is "the [Act's] only response to habitat modifica515us3$88k 08-18-98 09:04:45 PAGES OPINPGT

tion." Ibid. Of course not, since that is not so (all publiclands are subject to habitat-modification restrictions); but (1)

and (2) are quite enough to exclude the Court's interpreta-tion. They identify the land acquisition program as the
Act's only response to habitat modification by private landowners, and thus do not in the least "contradic[t]," ibid., thefact that $ 1536 prohibits habitat modification

by federal
agencies.Third, the Court seeks support from a provision that was

added to the Act in 1982, the year after the Secretary pro-mulgated the current regulation. The provision states:

"[T]he Secretary may permit, under such terms andconditions as he shall prescribe--

. . . . .
"any taking otherwise prohibited by section 1538
(a)(1)(B) . . . if such taking is incidental to, and not thepurpose of, the carrying out of an otherwise lawful

activity." 16 U. S. C. $ 1539(a)(1)(B).
This provision does not, of course, implicate our doctrine that
reenactment of a statutory provision ratifies an extant judi-cial or administrative interpretation, for neither the taking

prohibition in $ 1538(a)(1)(B) nor the definition in $ 1532(19)was reenacted. See

Central Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First
Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A., 511 U. S. 164, 185 (1994).
The Court claims, however, that the provision "strongly sug-gests that Congress understood [$ 1538(a)(1)(B)] to prohibit

indirect as well as deliberate takings." Ante, at 700. Thatwould be a valid inference if habitat modification were the
only substantial "otherwise lawful activity" that might incidentally and nonpurposefully cause a prohibited "taking."
Of course it is not. This provision applies to the many otherwise lawful takings that incidentally take a protected species--as when fishing for unprotected salmon also takes an
endangered species of salmon, see Pacific Northwest Generating Cooperative v. Brown, 38 F. 3d 1058, 1067 (CA9 1994).

Scalia, J., dissenting

Congress has referred to such "incidental takings" in otherstatutes as well--for example, a statute referring to "the

incidental taking of . . . sea turtles in the course of . . . har-vesting [shrimp]" and to the "rate of incidental taking of sea
turtles by United States vessels in the course of such har-vesting," 103 Stat. 1038, $ 609(b)(2), note following 16 U. S. C.

$ 1537 (1988 ed., Supp. V); and a statute referring to "theincidental taking of marine mammals in the course of commercial fishing operations," 108 Stat. 546, $ 118(a). TheCourt shows that it misunderstands the question when it
says that "[n]o one could seriously request an `incidental'take permit to avert . . . liability for direct, deliberate action
against a member of an endangered or threatened species."Ante, at 700-701 (emphasis added). That is not an incidental take at all.4This is enough to show, in my view, that the 1982 permit
provision does not support the regulation. I must acknowl-edge that the Senate Committee Report on this provision,
and the House Conference Committee Report, clearly con-template that it will enable the Secretary to permit environmental modification. See S. Rep. No. 97-418, p. 10 (1982);H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 97-835, pp. 30-32 (1982). But the text
of the amendment cannot possibly bear that asserted mean-ing, when placed within the context of an Act that must be
interpreted (as we have seen) not to prohibit private en-vironmental modification. The neutral language of the
amendment cannot possibly alter that interpretation, nor canits legislative history be summoned forth to contradict,
rather than clarify, what is in its totality an unambiguousstatutory text. See

Chicago v. Environmental DefenseFund, 511 U. S. 328 (1994). There is little fear, of course,

4 The statutory requirement of a "conservation plan" is as consistent
with this construction as with the Court's. See ante, at 700, and n. 14.

protected fish in his nets can quite reasonably be required to "minimize
and mitigate" the "impact" of his activity. 16 U. S. C. $ 1539(a)(2)(A).

that giving no effect to the relevant portions of the Commit-tee Reports will frustrate the real-life expectations of a majority of the Members of Congress. If they read and reliedon such tedious detail on such an obscure point (it was not,
after all, presented as a revision of the statute's prohibitory
scope, but as a discretionary-waiver provision) the Republicwould be in grave peril.

Fourth and lastly, the Court seeks to avoid the evidentshortcomings of the regulation on the ground that the respondents are challenging it on its face rather than as ap-plied. See

ante, at 699; see also ante, at 709 (O'Connor,
J., concurring). The Court seems to say that even if the
regulation dispenses with the foreseeability of harm that it
acknowledges the statute to require, that does not matter
because this is a facial challenge: So long as habitat modification that would foreseeably cause harm is prohibited by
the statute, the regulation must be sustained. Presumably
it would apply the same reasoning to all the other defects of
the regulation: The regulation's failure to require injury to
particular animals survives the present challenge, because at
least some environmental modifications kill particular animals. This evisceration of the facial challenge is unprecedented. It is one thing to say that a facial challenge to a
regulation that omits statutory element x must be rejected
if there is any set of facts on which the statute does not
require x. It is something quite different--and unlike any
doctrine of "facial challenge" I have ever encountered--to
say that the challenge must be rejected if the regulation
could be applied to a state of facts in which element x happens to be present. On this analysis, the only regulation
susceptible to facial attack is one that not only is invalid in
all its applications, but also does not sweep up any person
who could have been held liable under a proper application
of the statute. That is not the law. Suppose a statute that
prohibits "premeditated killing of a human being," and an
implementing regulation that prohibits "killing a human

being." A facial challenge to the regulation would not berejected on the ground that, after all, it could be applied to

a killing that happened to be premeditated. It could notbe applied to such a killing, because it does not require the
factfinder to find premeditation, as the statute requires. Inother words, to simplify its task the Court today confuses
lawful application of the challenged regulation with lawfulapplication of a

different regulation, i. e., one requiring thevarious elements of liability that this regulation omits.

III
In response to the points made in this dissent, the Court'sopinion stresses two points, neither of which is supported by

the regulation, and so cannot validly be used to uphold it.First, the Court and the concurrence suggest that the regulation should be read to contain a requirement of proximatecausation or foreseeability, principally

because the statutedoes--and "[n]othing in the regulation purports to weaken

those requirements [of the statute]." See ante, at 696-697,n. 9; 700, n. 13; see also ante, at 711-713 (

O'Connor, J., con-curring). I quite agree that the statute contains such a limitation, because the verbs of purpose in $ 1538(a)(1)(B) denoteaction directed at animals.

But the Court has rejected that
reading. The critical premise on which it has upheld theregulation is that, despite the weight of the other words in

$ 1538(a)(1)(B), "the statutory term `harm' encompasses indi-rect as well as direct injuries," ante, at 697-698. See also
ante, at 698, n. 11 (describing "the sense of indirect causationthat `harm' adds to the statute"); ante, at 702 (stating that
the Secretary permissibly interprets " `harm' " to include "in-directly injuring endangered animals"). Consequently, unless there is some strange category of causation that is indi-rect and yet also proximate, the Court has already rejected
its own basis for finding a proximate-cause limitation in theregulation. In fact "proximate" causation simply

means"direct" causation. See, e. g., Black's Law Dictionary 1103

515us3$88k 08-18-98 09:04:45 PAGES OPINPGT

733Cite as: 515 U. S. 687 (1995)
Scalia, J., dissenting
(5th ed. 1979) (defining "[p]roximate" as "Immediate; nearest;
direct") (emphasis added); Webster's New International
Dictionary 1995 (2d ed. 1949) ("[P]roximate cause. A causewhich

directly, or with no mediate agency, produces an
effect") (emphasis added).

The only other reason given for finding a proximate-causelimitation in the regulation is that "by use of the word `actually,' the regulation clearly rejects speculative or conjecturaleffects, and thus itself

invokes principles of proximate causation." Ante, at 712 (O'Connor, J., concurring); see also
ante, at 700, n. 13 (majority opinion). Non sequitur, of
course. That the injury must be "actual" as opposed to
"potential" simply says nothing at all about the length or
foreseeability of the causal chain between the habitat modification and the "actual" injury. It is thus true and irrelevant that "[t]he Secretary did not need to include `actually'
to connote `but for' causation," ibid.; "actually" defines the
requisite injury, not the requisite causality.

The regulation says (it is worth repeating) that "harm"
means (1) an act that (2) actually kills or injures wildlife. If
that does not dispense with a proximate-cause requirement,
I do not know what language would. And changing the regulation by judicial invention, even to achieve compliance with
the statute, is not permissible. Perhaps the agency itself
would prefer to achieve compliance in some other fashion.
We defer to reasonable agency interpretations of ambiguous
statutes precisely in order that agencies, rather than courts,
may exercise policymaking discretion in the interstices of
statutes. See Chevron, 467 U. S., at 843-845. Just as
courts may not exercise an agency's power to adjudicate, and
so may not affirm an agency order on discretionary grounds
the agency has not advanced, see SEC v. Chenery Corp., 318
U. S. 80 (1943), so also this Court may not exercise the Secretary's power to regulate, and so may not uphold a regulation
by adding to it even the most reasonable of elements it does
not contain.

Scalia, J., dissenting

The second point the Court stresses in its response seems
to me a belated mending of its holding. It apparently concedes that the statute requires injury to particular animals
rather than merely to populations of animals. See ante, at
700, n. 13; ante, at 696 (referring to killing or injuring
"members of [listed] species" (emphasis added)). The Court
then rejects my contention that the regulation ignores this
requirement, since, it says, "every term in the regulation's
definition of `harm' is subservient to the phrase `an act which
actually kills or injures wildlife.' " Ante, at 700, n. 13. As
I have pointed out, see supra, at 716-717, this reading is
incompatible with the regulation's specification of impairment of "breeding" as one of the modes of "kill[ing] or injur[ing] wildlife." 5

5 Justice O'Connor supposes that an "impairment of breeding" intrinsically injures an animal because "to make it impossible for an animal to
reproduce is to impair its most essential physical functions and to render
that animal, and its genetic material, biologically obsolete." Ante, at 710
(concurring opinion). This imaginative construction does achieve the result of extending "impairment of breeding" to individual animals; but only
at the expense of also expanding "injury" to include elements beyond
physical harm to individual animals. For surely the only harm to the
individual animal from impairment of that "essential function" is not the
failure of issue (which harms only the issue), but the psychic harm of
perceiving that it will leave this world with no issue (assuming, of course,
that the animal in question, perhaps an endangered species of slug, is capable of such painful sentiments). If it includes that psychic harm, then
why not the psychic harm of not being able to frolic about--so that the
draining of a pond used for an endangered animal's recreation, but in no
way essential to its survival, would be prohibited by the Act? That the
concurrence is driven to such a dubious redoubt is an argument for, not
against, the proposition that "injury" in the regulation includes injury
to populations of animals. Even more so with the concurrence's alternative explanation: that "impairment of breeding" refers to nothing more
than concrete injuries inflicted by the habitat modification on the animal
who does the breeding, such as "physical complications [suffered] during
gestation," ibid. Quite obviously, if "impairment of breeding" meant

But since the Court is reading the regulation and the stat-ute incorrectly in other respects, it may as well introduce

this novelty as well--law a` la carte. As I understand theregulation that the Court has created and held consistent
with the statute that it has also created, habitat modification
can constitute a "taking," but only if it results in the killingor harming of

individual animals, and only if that consequence is the direct result of the modification. This meansthat the destruction of privately owned habitat that is essential, not for the feeding or nesting, but for the breeding, ofbutterflies, would not violate the Act, since it would not
harm or kill any living butterfly. I, too, think it would notviolate the Act--not for the utterly unsupported reason that
habitat modifications fall outside the regulation if they happen not to kill or injure a living animal, but for the textualreason that only action directed at living animals constitutes

a "take." * * *

The Endangered Species Act is a carefully consideredpiece of legislation that forbids all persons to hunt or harm
endangered animals, but places upon the public at large,
such physical harm to an individual animal, it would not have had to be
mentioned.

The concurrence entangles itself in a dilemma while attempting to explain the Secretary's commentary to the harm regulation, which stated
that "harm" is not limited to "direct physical injury to an individual member of the wildlife species," 46 Fed. Reg. 54748 (1981). The concurrence
denies that this means that the regulation does not require injury to particular animals, because "one could just as easily emphasize the word `direct' in this sentence as the word `individual.' " Ante, at 711. One could;
but if the concurrence does, it thereby refutes its separate attempt to
exclude indirect causation from the regulation's coverage, see ante, at 711-
713. The regulation, after emerging from the concurrence's analysis, has
acquired both a proximate-cause limitation and a particular-animals limitation--precisely the one meaning that the Secretary's quoted declaration
will not allow, whichever part of it is emphasized.

UNITED STATES v. HAYS et al.
appeal from the united states district court forthe western district of louisiana

No. 94-558. Argued April 19, 1995--Decided June 29, 1995*
Appellees claim in this litigation that Louisiana's congressional redistricting plan (Act 1) is a racial gerrymander that violates the Fourteenth
Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. While their claim's primary
focus is District 4, a majority-minority district, appellees live in District
5. The District Court invalidated Act 1, and the State and the United
States, which had precleared Act 1 pursuant to its authority under the
Voting Rights Act of 1965, appealed directly to this Court.

Held: Appellees lack standing to challenge Act 1. This Court has recognized that a generalized grievance against allegedly illegal governmental conduct is insufficient to provide standing, see, e. g., Valley Forge
Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of Church and
State, Inc., 454 U. S. 464, and has applied that rule in the equal protection context, see Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737, 755. Thus, appellees'
position that "anybody in the State" can state a racial gerrymander
claim is rejected, and they must show that they, personally, have been
subjected to a racial classification. Appellees, however, have pointed
to no evidence tending to show that they have suffered personal injury,
and review of the record has revealed none. Assuming, arguendo, that
the evidence here is sufficient to state a claim under Shaw v. Reno, 509
U. S. 630, with respect to District 4, it does not prove that the state
legislature intended District 5 to have a particular racial composition.
Similarly, the fact that Act 1 affects all Louisiana voters by classifying
each of them as a member of a particular congressional district does
not mean that every voter has standing to challenge Act 1 as a racial
classification. The Court's holding in Powers v. Ohio, 499 U. S. 400, that
an individual has the right not to be excluded from a jury on account
of race does not support appellees' position. A juror so excluded has
personally suffered the race-based harm recognized in Powers, and it
is the fact of personal injury that appellees have failed to establish
here. Pp. 742-747.

Opinion of the Court
and that the separation lacks sufficient justification." Id.,at 658. Appellees Ray Hays, Edward Adams, Susan Shaw

Singleton, and Gary Stokley claim that the State of Louisi-ana's congressional districting plan is such a "racial gerrymander," and that it violates the Fourteenth Amendment.But appellees do not live in the district that is the primary
focus of their racial gerrymandering claim, and they havenot otherwise demonstrated that they, personally, have been
subjected to a racial classification. For that reason, we con-clude that appellees lack standing to bring this lawsuit.

I
Louisiana has been covered by $ 4(b) of the Voting RightsAct of 1965 (VRA), 79 Stat. 438, as amended, 84 Stat. 315,

42 U. S. C. $ 1973b(b), since November 1, 1964, see 28 CFRpt. 51, App. The effect of such coverage is set forth in VRA

$ 5, 42 U. S. C. $ 1973c: Whenever a covered jurisdiction"shall enact or seek to administer any voting qualification or
prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice, or procedurewith respect to voting different from that in force or effect
on November 1, 1964," it must first either obtain a declara-tory judgment from the United States District Court for the
District of Columbia that the change "does not have the pur-pose and will not have the effect of denying or abridging
the right to vote on account of race or color," or receive"preclearance" from the Attorney General to the same
effect. Any redistricting plan in Louisiana is subject tothese requirements.

Accordingly, in 1991, Louisiana submitted to the AttorneyGeneral for preclearance a districting plan for its Board of
Elementary and Secondary Education (BESE). Louisiana'sBESE districts historically have paralleled its congressional
districts, so the submitted plan contained one majority-minority district (that is, a district "in which a majority of
the population is a member of a specific minority group,"Voinovich v. Quilter, 507 U. S. 146, 149 (1993)) out of eight, as

Opinion of the Court
did Louisiana's congressional districting plan then in force.*The Attorney General refused to preclear the plan, claiming

that Louisiana had failed to demonstrate that its decision notto create a second majority-minority district was free of
racially discriminatory purpose. See Defense Exh. 17 inNo. 92-1522 (WD La.) (letter from U. S. Dept. of Justice, Assistant Attorney General John Dunne, to Louisiana Assist-ant Attorney General Angie R. LaPlace, Oct. 1, 1991). The
Attorney General subsequently precleared a revised BESEplan, which contained two majority-minority districts. See
Brief for Appellants State of Louisiana et al. 3, n. 2.As a result of the 1990 census, Louisiana's congressional
delegation was reduced from eight to seven representatives,requiring Louisiana to redraw its district boundaries. Perhaps in part because of its recent experience with the BESEdistricts, the Louisiana Legislature set out to create a districting plan containing two majority-minority districts.See, e. g., Tr. 11 (Aug. 19, 1993). Act 42 of the 1992 Regular
Session, passed in May 1992, was such a plan. One of Act42's majority-minority districts, District 2, was located in the
New Orleans area and resembled the majority-minority dis-trict in the previous district map. The other, District 4, was
"[a] Z-shaped creature" that "zigzag[ged] through all or partof 28 parishes and five of Louisiana's largest cities." Congressional Quarterly, Congressional Districts in the 1990s,p. 323 (1993). A map of Louisiana's congressional districts

*Between Reconstruction and the early 1980's, all of Louisiana's congressional districts contained a majority of white citizens, and it had not
elected any black congressional representatives. In 1983, a three-judge
court invalidated Louisiana's 1982 districting plan, on the ground that it
diluted minority voting strength in the New Orleans area in violation of
VRA $ 2, 42 U. S. C. $ 1973, and ordered the legislature to draw up a new
plan. See Major v. Treen, 574 F. Supp. 325 (ED La. 1983). The new plan
contained a majority-black district in the New Orleans area; in 1990, that
district elected Louisiana's first black representative since Reconstruction. See Congressional Quarterly, Congressional Districts in the 1990s,
pp. 319-320 (1993).

Opinion of the Court
under Act 42 is attached as Appendix A. The AttorneyGeneral precleared Act 42.

Appellees Hays, Adams, Singleton, and Stokley are resi-dents of Lincoln Parish, which is located in the north-central
part of Louisiana. According to the complaint, all but Singleton reside in that part of Lincoln Parish that was con-tained in the majority-minority District 4 of Act 42. See

Pet. for Permanent Injunction and Declaratory Judgment inNo. CV 92-1522 (WD La.), p. 4. In August 1992, appellees
filed suit in state court, challenging Act 42 under the Stateand Federal Constitutions, as well as the VRA. The State
removed the case to the United States District Court for the
Western District of Louisiana, and, as required by the VRA,
a three-judge court convened to hear the case pursuant to 28
U. S. C. $ 2284. After a 2-day trial, the District Court denied appellees' request for a preliminary injunction, denied
the state and federal constitutional claims, and took the VRA
claims under advisement. While the case was pending, this
Court decided Shaw v. Reno, whereupon the District Court
revoked its prior rulings and held another 2-day hearing.
Focusing almost exclusively on the oddly shaped District 4,
the District Court decided that Act 42 violated the Constitution, and enjoined its enforcement. See Hays v. Louisiana,
839 F. Supp. 1188 (WD La. 1993) (Hays I).

Louisiana appealed directly to this Court, pursuant to 28
U. S. C. $ 1253. While the appeal was pending, the Louisiana Legislature repealed Act 42 and enacted a new districting plan, Act 1 of the 1994 Second Extraordinary Session.
The Attorney General precleared Act 1. We then vacated
the District Court's judgment and remanded the case "for
further consideration in light of Act 1." 512 U. S. 1230
(1994). A map of Act 1 is attached as Appendix B.

Act 1, like Act 42, contains two majority-minority districts,
one of which (District 2) is again located in the New Orleans
area. The second majority-minority district in Act 1, however, is considerably different from that in Act 42. While

515us3$89j 08-12-98 19:25:49 PAGES OPINPGT
742 UNITED STATES v. HAYS

Opinion of the Court
Act 42's District 4 ran in a zigzag fashion along the northernand eastern borders of the State, Act 1's District 4 begins in

the northwestern part of the State and runs southeast alongthe Red River until it reaches Baton Rouge. For present
purposes, the most significant difference between the twodistrict maps is that in Act 42, part of Lincoln Parish was
contained in District 4, while in Act 1, Lincoln Parish is en-tirely contained in District 5.

On remand, the District Court allowed appellees to amendtheir complaint to challenge Act 1's constitutionality and permitted the United States to intervene as a defendant. Itthen held another 2-day hearing and concluded, largely for
the same reasons that it had invalidated Act 42, that Act 1was unconstitutional. See Hays v. Louisiana, 862 F. Supp.
119 (WD La. 1994) (Hays II). The court enjoined the Statefrom conducting any elections pursuant to Act 1, substituted
its own districting plan, and denied the State's motion for astay of judgment pending appeal.

Louisiana and the United States appealed directly to thisCourt. We stayed the District Court's judgment, 512 U. S.
1273 (1994), and noted probable jurisdiction, 513 U. S. 1056(1994).

II
The District Court concluded that appellees had standingto challenge Act 42, see Hays I, 839 F. Supp., at 1192, but

did not reconsider standing when faced with Act 1. Thequestion of standing is not subject to waiver, however: "[W]e
are required to address the issue even if the courts belowhave not passed on it, and even if the parties fail to raise the
issue before us. The federal courts are under an independ-ent obligation to examine their own jurisdiction, and standing `is perhaps the most important of [the jurisdictional] doc-trines.' "

FW/PBS, Inc. v. Dallas, 493 U. S. 215, 230-231(1990) (citations omitted).

It is by now well settled that "the irreducible constitu-tional minimum of standing contains three elements. First,

743Cite as: 515 U. S. 737 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
the plaintiff must have suffered an `injury in fact'--an inva-sion of a legally protected interest that is (a) concrete and

particularized, and (b) actual or imminent, not conjecturalor hypothetical. Second, there must be a causal connection
between the injury and the conduct complained of . . . .
Third, it must be likely, as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision."

Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 560-561 (1992)(footnote, citations, and internal quotation marks omitted);
see also, e. g., Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737, 751 (1984); Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc., 454 U. S. 464, 472 (1982).
In light of these principles, we have repeatedly refused to
recognize a generalized grievance against allegedly illegal
governmental conduct as sufficient for standing to invoke the
federal judicial power. See, e. g., Valley Forge Christian
College, supra; Schlesinger v. Reservists Comm. to Stop the
War, 418 U. S. 208 (1974); United States v. Richardson, 418
U. S. 166 (1974); Ex parte Le'vitt, 302 U. S. 633 (1937) (per
curiam). We have also made clear that "it is the burden of
the `party who seeks the exercise of jurisdiction in his favor,'
McNutt v. General Motors Acceptance Corp., 298 U. S. 178,
189 (1936), `clearly to allege facts demonstrating that he is
a proper party to invoke judicial resolution of the dispute.'
Warth v. Seldin, 422 U. S. 490, 518 (1975)." FW/PBS, supra,
at 231. And when a case has proceeded to final judgment
after a trial, as this case has, "those facts (if controverted)
must be `supported adequately by the evidence adduced at
trial' " to avoid dismissal on standing grounds. Lujan,
supra, at 561 (quoting Gladstone, Realtors v. Village of Bellwood, 441 U. S. 91, 115, n. 31 (1979)).

The rule against generalized grievances applies with as
much force in the equal protection context as in any other.
Allen v. Wright made clear that even if a governmental actor
is discriminating on the basis of race, the resulting injury
"accords a basis for standing only to `those persons who are

Opinion of the Court
personally denied equal treatment' by the challenged discriminatory conduct." 468 U. S., at 755 (quoting Heckler v.
Mathews, 465 U. S. 728, 740 (1984)); see also Valley Forge
Christian College, supra, at 489-490, n. 26 (disapproving the
proposition that every citizen has "standing to challenge
every affirmative-action program on the basis of a personal
right to a government that does not deny equal protection
of the laws"). We therefore reject appellees' position that
"anybody in the State has a claim," Tr. of Oral Arg. 36, and
adhere instead to the principles outlined above.

We discussed the harms caused by racial classifications in
Shaw. We noted that, in general, "[t]hey threaten to stigmatize individuals by reason of their membership in a racial
group and to incite racial hostility." 509 U. S., at 643. We
also noted "representational harms" the particular type of
racial classification at issue in Shaw may cause: "When a district obviously is created solely to effectuate the perceived
common interests of one racial group, elected officials are
more likely to believe that their primary obligation is to represent only the members of that group, rather than their
constituency as a whole." Id., at 648. Accordingly, we held
that "redistricting legislation that is so bizarre on its face
that it is `unexplainable on grounds other than race' demands
the same close scrutiny that we give other state laws that
classify citizens by race." Id., at 644 (citation omitted).
Any citizen able to demonstrate that he or she, personally,
has been injured by that kind of racial classification has
standing to challenge the classification in federal court.

Demonstrating the individualized harm our standing doctrine requires may not be easy in the racial gerrymandering
context, as it will frequently be difficult to discern why a
particular citizen was put in one district or another. See id.,
at 646 (noting "the difficulty of determining from the face of
a single-member districting plan that it purposefully distinguishes between voters on the basis of race"). Where a

515us3$89j 08-12-98 19:25:49 PAGES OPINPGT

745Cite as: 515 U. S. 737 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
plaintiff resides in a racially gerrymandered district, however, the plaintiff has been denied equal treatment because
of the legislature's reliance on racial criteria, and therefore has standing to challenge the legislature's action, cf.
Northeastern Fla. Chapter, Associated Gen. Contractors of
America v. Jacksonville, 508 U. S. 656 (1993). Voters in
such districts may suffer the special representational harms
racial classifications can cause in the voting context. On the
other hand, where a plaintiff does not live in such a district,
he or she does not suffer those special harms, and any inference that the plaintiff has personally been subjected to
a racial classification would not be justified absent specific
evidence tending to support that inference. Unless such
evidence is present, that plaintiff would be asserting only
a generalized grievance against governmental conduct of
which he or she does not approve.

In this litigation, appellees have not produced evidence
sufficient to carry the burden our standing doctrine imposes
upon them. Even assuming (without deciding) that Act 1
causes injury sufficient to invoke strict scrutiny under Shaw,
appellees have pointed to no evidence tending to show that
they have suffered that injury, and our review of the record
has revealed none. Neither Act 1 itself, see App. to Juris.
Statement for Louisiana et al. 111-120; Appendix B, infra,
nor any other evidence in the record indicates that appellees,
or any other residents of Lincoln Parish, have been subjected
to racially discriminatory treatment. The record does contain evidence tending to show that the legislature was aware
of the racial composition of District 5, and of Lincoln Parish.
We recognized in Shaw, however, that "the legislature always is aware of race when it draws district lines, just as
it is aware of age, economic status, religious and political
persuasion, and a variety of other demographic factors.
That sort of race consciousness does not lead inevitably to
impermissible race discrimination." 509 U. S., at 646. It

515us3$89j 08-12-98 19:25:49 PAGES OPINPGT
746 UNITED STATES v. HAYS

Opinion of the Court
follows that proof of "[t]hat sort of race consciousness" inthe redistricting process is inadequate to establish injury in

fact. Ibid.Appellees urge that District 5 is a "segregated" voting district, and thus that their position is no different from that of
a student in a segregated school district, see Brief for Appel-lees 17 (citing

Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483
(1954)); Tr. of Oral Arg. 33. But even assuming, arguendo,that the evidence in this litigation is enough to state a

Shaw
claim with respect to District 4, that does not prove anythingabout the legislature's intentions with respect to District 5,

nor does the record appear to reflect that the legislature intended District 5 to have any particular racial composition.
Of course, it may be true that the racial composition of District 5 would have been different if the legislature had drawn
District 4 in another way. But an allegation to that effect
does not allege a cognizable injury under the Fourteenth
Amendment. We have never held that the racial composition of a particular voting district, without more, can violate
the Constitution. Cf. Shaw, supra, at 644-649; Mobile v.
Bolden, 446 U. S. 55 (1980).

Appellees insist that they challenged Act 1 in its entirety,
not District 4 in isolation. Tr. of Oral Arg. 36. That is true.
It is also irrelevant. The fact that Act 1 affects all Louisiana
voters by classifying each of them as a member of a particular congressional district does not mean--even if Act 1 inflicts race-based injury on some Louisiana voters--that
every Louisiana voter has standing to challenge Act 1 as a
racial classification. Only those citizens able to allege injury
"as a direct result of having personally been denied equal
treatment," Allen, 468 U. S., at 755 (emphasis added), may
bring such a challenge, and citizens who do so carry the burden of proving their standing, as well as their case on the
merits.

Appellees' reliance on Powers v. Ohio, 499 U. S. 400 (1991),
is unavailing. Powers held that "[a]n individual juror does

515us3$89j 08-12-98 19:25:49 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
not have a right to sit on any particular petit jury, but he orshe does possess the right not to be excluded from one on

account of race." Id., at 409. But of course, where an indi-vidual juror is excluded from a jury because of race, that
juror has personally suffered the race-based harm recognized in Powers, and it is the fact of personal injury thatappellees have failed to establish here. Thus, appellees' argument that "they do have a right not to be placed into orexcluded from a district because of the color of their skin,"
Brief for Appellees 16, cannot help them, because they havenot established that

they have suffered such treatment in
this litigation.

Justice Stevens agrees that appellees lack standing, but
on quite different grounds: In his view, appellees' failure to
allege and prove vote dilution deprives them of standing,
irrespective of whether they have alleged and proved the
injury discussed in Shaw. Post, at 751; see also Miller v.
Johnson, post, at 931 (Stevens, J., dissenting). Justice
White's dissenting opinion in Shaw argued that position, see
Shaw, 509 U. S., at 659 ("Appellants have not presented a
cognizable claim, because they have not alleged a cognizable
injury"); post, at 751-752 (quoting Justice White's dissent in
Shaw), but it did not prevail. Justice Stevens offers no
special reason to revisit the issue here.

We conclude that appellees have failed to show that they
have suffered the injury our standing doctrine requires. Appellees point us to no authority for the proposition that an
equal protection challenge may go forward in federal court
absent that showing of individualized harm, and we decline
appellees' invitation to approve that proposition in this litigation. Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court
is vacated, and the cases are remanded with instructions to
dismiss the complaint.

It is so ordered.

Justice Ginsburg concurs in the judgment.

I join the Court's opinion to the extent that it discussesvoters, such as those before us, who do not reside within the

Justice Stevens, concurring in the judgment.
The majority apparently would find standing under Shawv.

Reno, 509 U. S. 630 (1993), for plaintiffs of all races whoresided in an electoral district in which "the legislatur[e] reli[ed] on racial criteria" to classify all voters, ante, at 745,and who could show that they were " `placed into or excluded
from a district because of the color of their skin,' " ante, at747 (citing Brief for Appellees 16). The majority fails to
explain coherently how a State discriminates invidiously bydeliberately joining members of different races in the same
district; why such placement amounts to an injury to mem-bers of any race; and, assuming it does, to whom.

The term "gerrymander" has long been understood tomean "any set of districts which gives some advantage to
the party which draws the electoral map." P. Musgrove,General Theory of Gerrymandering 6 (1977). As Justice
Powell noted, "a colorable claim of discriminatory gerrymandering presents a justiciable controversy under the EqualProtection Clause."

Davis v. Bandemer, 478 U. S. 109, 185
(1986) (dissenting opinion); see also Gomillion v. Lightfoot,364 U. S. 339 (1960). The complaint in this litigation, however, did not allege a discriminatory gerrymander. Appel-lees made no claim that any political or racial majority had
drawn district lines to disadvantage a weaker segment of thecommunity. Indeed, the complaint did not even identify the
race or the political affiliation of any of the appellees. It
simply alleged that every voter in Louisiana was injured bybeing deprived of the right "to participate in a process for

electing members of the House of Representatives which is

majority of the voters placed in the designated districts."Pet. for Permanent Injunction and Declaratory Judgment in

" `a personal right to a government that does not deny equalprotection of the laws,' "

ante, at 744 (citing Valley ForgeChristian College v. Americans United for Separation of

Church and State, Inc., 454 U. S. 464, 489-490, n. 26 (1982)),it holds that the mere fact of appellees' Louisiana residency
does not give them standing. I agree with that conclusion.What I do not understand is the majority's view that these
racially diverse appellees should fare better if they resided inblack-majority districts instead of white-majority districts.
Appellees have not alleged or proved that the State's dis-tricting has substantially disadvantaged any group of voters
in their opportunity to influence the political process. Theytherefore lack standing to argue that Louisiana has adopted
an unconstitutional gerrymander. See Davis, 478 U. S., at125, 132-133. Even under a standing analysis that applied
a more lenient rule for the victims of racial gerrymandering,see id., at 151-152 (

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment),appellees could not prevail, because they fail to allege having

been "shut out of the political process." Id., at 139 (opinionof White, J.).

Accordingly, I cannot join the Court's opinion. I wouldsimply hold that appellees have not made out the essential
elements of a gerrymandering claim for the same reasons setforth in Justice White's dissenting opinion in

Shaw:

"Because districting inevitably is the expression of in-terest group politics, and because `the power to influence

the political process is not limited to winning elections,'the question in gerrymandering cases is `whether a
particular group has been unconstitutionally denied

where the electoral system substantially disadvantagescertain voters in their opportunity to influence the
political process effectively.' " Shaw, 509 U. S., at662-663 (quoting

Davis, 478 U. S., at 132-133) (emphasisin original).

Because these appellees have not alleged any legally cogni-zable injury, I agree that they lack standing. I therefore
concur in the judgment.

Ohio law makes Capitol Square, the statehouse plaza in Columbus, a forum

for discussion of public questions and for public activities, and gives
petitioner Capitol Square Review and Advisory Board (Board) responsibility for regulating access to the square. To use the square, a group
must simply fill out an official application form and meet several speechneutral criteria. After the Board denied, on Establishment Clause
grounds, the application of respondent Ku Klux Klan to place an unattended cross on the square during the 1993 Christmas season, the Klan
filed this suit. The District Court entered an injunction requiring issuance of the requested permit, and the Board permitted the Klan to erect
its cross. The Sixth Circuit affirmed the judgment, adding to a conflict
among the Courts of Appeals as to whether a private, unattended display of a religious symbol in a public forum violates the Establishment
Clause.

Held: The judgment is affirmed.
30 F. 3d 675, affirmed.

Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to
Parts I, II, and III, concluding that:

1. Because the courts below addressed only the Establishment Clause
issue and that is the sole question upon which certiorari was granted,
this Court will not consider respondents' contention that the State's
disapproval of the Klan's political views, rather than its desire to distance itself from sectarian religion, was the genuine reason for disallowing the cross display. Pp. 759-760.

2. The display was private religious speech that is as fully protected
under the Free Speech Clause as secular private expression. See, e. g.,
Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School Dist., 508 U. S.
384. Because Capitol Square is a traditional public forum, the Board
may regulate the content of the Klan's expression there only if such a
restriction is necessary, and narrowly drawn, to serve a compelling state
interest. Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators' Assn., 460 U. S.
37, 45. Pp. 760-761.

3. Compliance with the Establishment Clause may be a state interest
sufficiently compelling to justify content-based restrictions on speech,

see, e. g., Lamb's Chapel, 508 U. S., at 394-395, but the conclusion that
that interest is not implicated in this case is strongly suggested by the
presence here of the factors the Court considered determinative in striking down state restrictions on religious content in Lamb's Chapel, id.,
at 395, and Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U. S. 263, 274. As in those cases, the
State did not sponsor respondents' expression, the expression was made
on government property that had been opened to the public for speech,
and permission was requested through the same application process and
on the same terms required of other private groups. Pp. 761-763.

Justice Scalia, joined by The Chief Justice, Justice Kennedy,
and Justice Thomas, concluded in Part IV that petitioners' attempt to
distinguish this case from Lamb's Chapel and Widmar is unavailing.
Petitioners' argument that, because the forum's proximity to the seat
of government may cause the misperception that the cross bears the
State's approval, their content-based restriction is constitutional under
the so-called "endorsement test" of, e. g., County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U. S. 573,
and Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U. S. 668, is rejected. Their version of the
test, which would attribute private religious expression to a neutrally
behaving government, has no antecedent in this Court's Establishment
Clause jurisprudence, which has consistently upheld neutral government policies that happen to benefit religion. Where the Court has
tested for endorsement, the subject of the test was either expression by
the government itself, Lynch, supra, or else government action alleged
to discriminate in favor of private religious expression or activity, see,
e. g., Allegheny, supra. The difference between forbidden government
speech endorsing religion and protected private speech that does so
is what distinguishes Allegheny and Lynch from Widmar and Lamb's
Chapel. The distinction does not disappear when the private speech is
conducted close to the symbols of government. Given a traditional or
designated public forum, publicly announced and open to all on equal
terms, as well as purely private sponsorship of religious expression,
erroneous conclusions of state endorsement do not count. See Lamb's
Chapel, supra, at 395, and Widmar, supra, at 274. Nothing prevents
Ohio from requiring all private displays in the square to be identified as
such, but it may not, on the claim of misperception of official endorsement, ban all private religious speech from the square, or discriminate
against it by requiring religious speech alone to disclaim public sponsorship. Pp. 763-769.

Justice O'Connor, joined by Justice Souter and Justice Breyer,
concluded that the State has not presented a compelling justification for
denying respondents' permit. Pp. 772-783.

(a) The endorsement test supplies an appropriate standard for determining whether governmental practices relating to speech on religious
topics violate the Establishment Clause, even where a neutral state
policy toward private religious speech in a public forum is at issue.
Cf., e. g., Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School Dist.,
508 U. S. 384, 395. There is no necessity to carve out, as does the
plurality opinion, an exception to the test for the public forum context.
Pp. 773-778.

(b) On the facts of this case, the reasonable observer would not fairly
interpret the State's tolerance of the Klan's religious display as an endorsement of religion. See, e. g., Lamb's Chapel, supra, at 395. In this
context, the "reasonable observer" is the personification of a community
ideal of reasonable behavior, determined by the collective social judgment, whose knowledge is not limited to information gleaned from viewing the challenged display, but extends to the general history of the
place in which the display appears. In this case, therefore, such an
observer may properly be held, not simply to knowledge that the cross
is purely a religious symbol, that Capitol Square is owned by the State,
and that the seat of state government is nearby, but also to an awareness that the square is a public space in which a multiplicity of secular and religious groups engage in expressive conduct, as well as to an
ability to read and understand the disclaimer that the Klan offered to
include in its display. Pp. 778-782.

Justice Souter, joined by Justice O'Connor and Justice Breyer,
concluded that, given the available alternatives, the Board cannot claim
that its denial of the Klan's application was a narrowly tailored response
necessary to ensure that the State did not appear to take a position on
questions of religious belief. Pp. 783-794.

(a) The plurality's per se rule would be an exception to the endorsement test, not previously recognized and out of square with this Court's
precedents. As the plurality admits, there are some circumstances in
which an intelligent observer would reasonably perceive private religious expression in a public forum to imply the government's endorsement of religion. Such perceptions should be attributed to the reasonable observer of Establishment Clause analysis under the Court's
decisions, see, e. g., County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties
Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U. S. 573, 630, 635-636 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), which have
looked to the specific circumstances of the private religious speech and
the public forum to determine whether there is any realistic danger
that such an observer would think that the government was endorsing
religion, see, e. g., Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U. S. 668, 692, 694 (O'Connor,

J., concurring). The plurality's per se rule would, in all but a handful
of cases, make the endorsement test meaningless. Pp. 785-792.

(b) Notwithstanding that there was nothing else on the statehouse
lawn suggesting a forum open to any and all private, unattended religious displays, a flat denial of the Klan's application was not the Board's
only option to protect against an appearance of endorsement. Either
of two possibilities would have been better suited to the requirement
that the Board find its most "narrowly drawn" alternative. Perry Ed.
Assn. v. Perry Local Educators' Assn., 460 U. S. 37, 45. First, the
Board could have required a disclaimer sufficiently large and clear to
preclude any reasonable inference that the cross demonstrated governmental endorsement. In the alternative, the Board could have instituted a policy of restricting all private, unattended displays to one area
of the square, with a permanent sign marking the area as a forum for
private speech carrying no state endorsement. Pp. 792-794.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Scalia announced the judgment of the Court anddelivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I,

II, and III, and an opinion with respect to Part IV, in which
The Chief Justice, Justice Kennedy, and Justice
Thomas join.

The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, madebinding upon the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, provides that government "shall make no law respect-ing an establishment of religion." The question in this case
is whether a State violates the Establishment Clause when,pursuant to a religiously neutral state policy, it permits a
private party to display an unattended religious symbolin a traditional public forum located next to its seat of
government. I

Capitol Square is a 10-acre, state-owned plaza surroundingthe statehouse in Columbus, Ohio. For over a century the
square has been used for public speeches, gatherings, andfestivals advocating and celebrating a variety of causes, both
secular and religious. Ohio Admin. Code Ann. $ 128-4-02(A) (1994) makes the square available "for use by the public . . . for free discussion of public questions, or for activities
of a broad public purpose," and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. $ 105.41(1994), gives the Capitol Square Review and Advisory Board

(Board) responsibility for regulating public access. To use
the square, a group must simply fill out an official application

form and meet several criteria, which concern primarilysafety, sanitation, and noninterference with other uses of the

square, and which are neutral as to the speech content ofthe proposed event. App. 107-110; Ohio Admin. Code Ann.

$ 128-4-02 (1994).

It has been the Board's policy "to allow a broad range ofspeakers and other gatherings of people to conduct events

on the Capitol Square." Brief for Petitioners 3-4. Suchdiverse groups as homosexual rights organizations, the Ku
Klux Klan, and the United Way have held rallies. TheBoard has also permitted a variety of unattended displays
on Capitol Square: a state-sponsored lighted tree during the
Christmas season, a privately sponsored menorah during
Chanukah, a display showing the progress of a United Way
fundraising campaign, and booths and exhibits during an arts
festival. Although there was some dispute in this litigation
regarding the frequency of unattended displays, the District
Court found, with ample justification, that there was no policy against them. 844 F. Supp. 1182, 1184 (SD Ohio 1993).

In November 1993, after reversing an initial decision to
ban unattended holiday displays from the square during
December 1993, the Board authorized the State to put up its
annual Christmas tree. On November 29, 1993, the Board
granted a rabbi's application to erect a menorah. That same
day, the Board received an application from respondent Donnie Carr, an officer of the Ohio Ku Klux Klan, to place a cross
on the square from December 8, 1993, to December 24, 1993.
The Board denied that application on December 3, informing
the Klan by letter that the decision to deny "was made upon
the advice of counsel, in a good faith attempt to comply with
the Ohio and United States Constitutions, as they have been
interpreted in relevant decisions by the Federal and State
Courts." App. 47.

Two weeks later, having been unsuccessful in its effort to
obtain administrative relief from the Board's decision, the
Ohio Klan, through its leader Vincent Pinette, filed the pres515us3$90k 08-18-98 09:06:45 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
ent suit in the United States District Court for the SouthernDistrict of Ohio, seeking an injunction requiring the Board

to issue the requested permit. The Board defended on theground that the permit would violate the Establishment
Clause. The District Court determined that Capitol Squarewas a traditional public forum open to all without any policy
against freestanding displays; that the Klan's cross was en-tirely private expression entitled to full First Amendment
protection; and that the Board had failed to show that thedisplay of the cross could reasonably be construed as endorsement of Christianity by the State. The District Courtissued the injunction and, after the Board's application for
an emergency stay was denied, 510 U. S. 1307 (1993) (Stevens, J., in chambers), the Board permitted the Klan to erectits cross. The Board then received, and granted, several

additional applications to erect crosses on Capitol Squareduring December 1993 and January 1994.

On appeal by the Board, the United States Court of Ap-peals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the District Court's judgment. 30 F. 3d 675 (1994). That decision agrees with a rul-ing by the Eleventh Circuit, Chabad-Lubavitch v. Miller, 5
F. 3d 1383 (1993), but disagrees with decisions of the Secondand Fourth Circuits, Chabad-Lubavitch v. Burlington, 936
F. 2d 109 (CA2 1991), cert. denied, 505 U. S. 1218 (1992),Kaplan v. Burlington, 891 F. 2d 1024 (CA2 1989), cert. denied, 496 U. S. 926 (1990), Smith v. County of Albemarle, 895F. 2d 953 (CA4), cert. denied, 498 U. S. 823 (1990). We
granted certiorari. 513 U. S. 1106 (1995).

II
First, a preliminary matter: Respondents contend that weshould treat this as a case in which freedom of speech (the

Klan's right to present the message of the cross display) wasdenied because of the State's disagreement with that message's political content, rather than because of the State'sdesire to distance itself from sectarian religion. They sug515us3$90k 08-18-98 09:06:45 PAGES OPINPGT

gest in their merits brief and in their oral argument that
Ohio's genuine reason for disallowing the display was disapproval of the political views of the Ku Klux Klan. Whatever
the fact may be, the case was not presented and decided that
way. The record facts before us and the opinions below address only the Establishment Clause issue; 1 that is the question upon which we granted certiorari; and that is the sole
question before us to decide.

Respondents' religious display in Capitol Square was private expression. Our precedent establishes that private religious speech, far from being a First Amendment orphan, is
as fully protected under the Free Speech Clause as secular
private expression. Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches
Union Free School Dist., 508 U. S. 384 (1993); Board of Ed.
of Westside Community Schools (Dist. 66) v. Mergens, 496
U. S. 226 (1990); Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U. S. 263 (1981);
Heffron v. International Soc. for Krishna Consciousness,
Inc., 452 U. S. 640 (1981). Indeed, in Anglo-American history, at least, government suppression of speech has so commonly been directed precisely at religious speech that a
free-speech clause without religion would be Hamlet without
the prince. Accordingly, we have not excluded from freespeech protections religious proselytizing, Heffron, supra, at
647, or even acts of worship, Widmar, supra, at 269, n. 6.
Petitioners do not dispute that respondents, in displaying
their cross, were engaging in constitutionally protected
expression. They do contend that the constitutional pro1 Respondents claim that the Sixth Circuit's statement that "[z]ealots
have First Amendment rights too," even if their views are unpopular,
shows that the case is actually about discrimination against political
speech. That conclusion is possible only if the statement is ripped from
its context, which was this: "The potency of religious speech is not a constitutional infirmity; the most fervently devotional and blatantly sectarian
speech is protected when it is private speech in a public forum. Zealots
have First Amendment rights too." 30 F. 3d 675, 680 (1994). The court
was obviously addressing zealous (and unpopular) religious speech.

tection does not extend to the length of permitting thatexpression to be made on Capitol Square.

It is undeniable, of course, that speech which is constitu-tionally protected against state suppression is not thereby
accorded a guaranteed forum on all property owned by theState.

Postal Service v. Council of Greenburgh CivicAssns., 453 U. S. 114, 129 (1981); Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry

Local Educators' Assn., 460 U. S. 37, 44 (1983). The rightto use government property for one's private expression
depends upon whether the property has by law or traditionbeen given the status of a public forum, or rather has been
reserved for specific official uses. Cornelius v. NAACP
Legal Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U. S. 788, 802-803(1985). If the former, a State's right to limit protected expressive activity is sharply circumscribed: It may imposereasonable, content-neutral time, place, and manner restrictions (a ban on all unattended displays, which did not existhere, might be one such), but it may regulate expressive content only if such a restriction is necessary, and narrowlydrawn, to serve a compelling state interest.

Perry Ed.Assn., supra, at 45. These strict standards apply here, since

the District Court and the Court of Appeals found that Capi-tol Square was a traditional public forum. 844 F. Supp., at
1184; 30 F. 3d, at 678.Petitioners do not claim that their denial of respondents'
application was based upon a content-neutral time, place, ormanner restriction. To the contrary, they concede--indeed
it is the essence of their case--that the Board rejected thedisplay precisely because its content was religious. Petitioners advance a single justification for closing Capitol Squareto respondents' cross: the State's interest in avoiding official
endorsement of Christianity, as required by the Establish-ment Clause.

III
There is no doubt that compliance with the EstablishmentClause is a state interest sufficiently compelling to justify

762 CAPITOL SQUARE REVIEW AND ADVISORY

BD. v. PINETTE

Opinion of the Court

content-based restrictions on speech. See Lamb's Chapel,
supra, at 394-395; Widmar, supra, at 271. Whether that
interest is implicated here, however, is a different question.
And we do not write on a blank slate in answering it. We
have twice previously addressed the combination of private
religious expression, a forum available for public use,
content-based regulation, and a State's interest in complying
with the Establishment Clause. Both times, we have struck
down the restriction on religious content. Lamb's Chapel,
supra; Widmar, supra.

In Lamb's Chapel, a school district allowed private groups
to use school facilities during off-hours for a variety of civic,
social, and recreational purposes, excluding, however, religious purposes. We held that even if school property during
off-hours was not a public forum, the school district violated
an applicant's free-speech rights by denying it use of the
facilities solely because of the religious viewpoint of the program it wished to present. 508 U. S., at 390-395. We rejected the district's compelling-state-interest Establishment
Clause defense (the same made here) because the school
property was open to a wide variety of uses, the district was
not directly sponsoring the religious group's activity, and
"any benefit to religion or to the Church would have been
no more than incidental." Id., at 395. The Lamb's Chapel
reasoning applies a fortiori here, where the property at issue
is not a school but a full-fledged public forum.

Lamb's Chapel followed naturally from our decision in
Widmar, in which we examined a public university's exclusion of student religious groups from facilities available to
other student groups. There also we addressed official discrimination against groups who wished to use a "generally
open forum" for religious speech. 454 U. S., at 269. And
there also the State claimed that its compelling interest in
complying with the Establishment Clause justified the
content-based restriction. We rejected the defense because

763Cite as: 515 U. S. 753 (1995)
Opinion of Scalia, J.
the forum created by the State was open to a broad spectrumof groups and would provide only incidental benefit to religion. Id., at 274. We stated categorically that "an openforum in a public university does not confer any imprimatur
of state approval on religious sects or practices." Ibid.Quite obviously, the factors that we considered determinative in Lamb's Chapel and Widmar exist here as well. TheState did not sponsor respondents' expression, the expression was made on government property that had beenopened to the public for speech, and permission was requested through the same application process and on thesame terms required of other private groups.

IV
Petitioners argue that one feature of the present case dis-tinguishes it from

Lamb's Chapel and Widmar: the forum'sproximity to the seat of government, which, they contend,

may produce the perception that the cross bears the State'sapproval. They urge us to apply the so-called "endorsement
test," see, e. g., County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U. S. 573(1989); Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U. S. 668 (1984), and to find

that, because an observer might mistake private expressionfor officially endorsed religious expression, the State's
content-based restriction is constitutional.We must note, to begin with, that it is not really an "endorsement test" of any sort, much less the "endorsementtest" which appears in our more recent Establishment
Clause jurisprudence, that petitioners urge upon us. "En-dorsement" connotes an expression or demonstration of approval or support. The New Shorter Oxford English Dic-tionary 818 (1993); Webster's New Dictionary 845 (2d ed.
1950). Our cases have accordingly equated "endorsement"with "promotion" or "favoritism."

Allegheny, supra, at 593
(citing cases). We find it peculiar to say that government

764 CAPITOL SQUARE REVIEW AND ADVISORY

BD. v. PINETTE

Opinion of Scalia, J.

"promotes" or "favors" a religious display by giving it the
same access to a public forum that all other displays enjoy.
And as a matter of Establishment Clause jurisprudence, we
have consistently held that it is no violation for government
to enact neutral policies that happen to benefit religion.
See, e. g., Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U. S. 589, 608 (1988);
Witters v. Washington Dept. of Servs. for Blind, 474 U. S.
481, 486-489 (1986); Mueller v. Allen, 463 U. S. 388 (1983);
McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U. S. 420 (1961). Where we
have tested for endorsement of religion, the subject of the
test was either expression by the government itself, Lynch,
supra, or else government action alleged to discriminate in
favor of private religious expression or activity, Board of
Ed. of Kiryas Joel Village School Dist. v. Grumet, 512 U. S.
687, 708-710 (1994); Allegheny, supra. The test petitioners
propose, which would attribute to a neutrally behaving government private religious expression, has no antecedent in
our jurisprudence, and would better be called a "transferred
endorsement" test.

Petitioners rely heavily on Allegheny and Lynch, but each
is easily distinguished. In Allegheny we held that the display of a privately sponsored cre` che on the "Grand Staircase"
of the Allegheny County Courthouse violated the Establishment Clause. That staircase was not, however, open to all
on an equal basis, so the county was favoring sectarian religious expression. 492 U. S., at 599-600, and n. 50 ("The
Grand Staircase does not appear to be the kind of location in
which all were free to place their displays"). We expressly
distinguished that site from the kind of public forum at issue
here, and made clear that if the staircase were available to
all on the same terms, "the presence of the cre` che in that
location for over six weeks would then not serve to associate
the government with the cre` che." Ibid. (emphasis added).
In Lynch we held that a city's display of a cre` che did not

violate the Establishment Clause because, in context, the

765Cite as: 515 U. S. 753 (1995)
Opinion of Scalia, J.
display did not endorse religion. 465 U. S., at 685-687.
The opinion does assume, as petitioners contend, that the
government's use of religious symbols is unconstitutional if
it effectively endorses sectarian religious belief. But the
case neither holds nor even remotely assumes that the government's neutral treatment of private religious expression
can be unconstitutional.

Petitioners argue that absence of perceived endorsement
was material in Lamb's Chapel and Widmar. We did state
in Lamb's Chapel that there was "no realistic danger that
the community would think that the District was endorsing
religion or any particular creed," 508 U. S., at 395. But that
conclusion was not the result of empirical investigation; it
followed directly, we thought, from the fact that the forum
was open and the religious activity privately sponsored.
See ibid. It is significant that we referred only to what
would be thought by "the community"--not by outsiders or
individual members of the community uninformed about the
school's practice. Surely some of the latter, hearing of religious ceremonies on school premises, and not knowing of the
premises' availability and use for all sorts of other private
activities, might leap to the erroneous conclusion of state
endorsement. But, we in effect said, given an open forum
and private sponsorship, erroneous conclusions do not count.
So also in Widmar. Once we determined that the benefit to
religious groups from the public forum was incidental and
shared by other groups, we categorically rejected the State's
Establishment Clause defense. 454 U. S., at 274.

What distinguishes Allegheny and the dictum in Lynch
from Widmar and Lamb's Chapel is the difference between
government speech and private speech. "[T]here is a crucial difference between government speech endorsing religion, which the Establishment Clause forbids, and private
speech endorsing religion, which the Free Speech and Free
Exercise Clauses protect." Mergens, 496 U. S., at 250 (opin515us3$90k 08-18-98 09:06:45 PAGES OPINPGT

ion of O'Connor, J.).2 Petitioners assert, in effect, that thatdistinction disappears when the private speech is conducted

too close to the symbols of government. But that, of course,must be merely a subpart of a more general principle: that
the distinction disappears whenever private speech can bemistaken for government speech. That proposition cannot
be accepted, at least where, as here, the government has notfostered or encouraged the mistake.

Of course, giving sectarian religious speech preferentialaccess to a forum close to the seat of government (or anywhere else for that matter) would violate the EstablishmentClause (as well as the Free Speech Clause, since it would
involve content discrimination). And one can conceive of acase in which a governmental entity manipulates its administration of a public forum close to the seat of government (orwithin a government building) in such a manner that only
certain religious groups take advantage of it, creating an im-pression of endorsement that is in fact accurate. But those
situations, which involve governmental favoritism, do notexist here. Capitol Square is a genuinely public forum, is
known to be a public forum, and has been widely used as apublic forum for many, many years. Private religious
speech cannot be subject to veto by those who see favoritismwhere there is none.

The contrary view, most strongly espoused by Justice
Stevens, post, at 806-807, but endorsed by Justice Souterand

Justice O'Connor as well, exiles private religiousspeech to a realm of less-protected expression heretofore

2 This statement in Justice O'Connor's Mergens opinion is followed by
the observation: "We think that secondary school students are mature
enough and are likely to understand that a school does not endorse or
support student speech that it merely permits on a nondiscriminatory
basis." 496 U. S., at 250. Justice O'Connor today says this observation means that, even when we recognize private speech to be at issue, we
must apply the endorsement test. Post, at 774-775. But that would cause
the second sentence to contradict the first, saying in effect that the "difference between government speech . . . and private speech" is not "crucial."

Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U. S. 557 (1980). It will
be a sad day when this Court casts piety in with pornography, and finds the First Amendment more hospitable toprivate expletives, see

Cohen v. California, 403 U. S. 15, 26
(1971), than to private prayers. This would be merely bi-zarre were religious speech simply

as protected by the Constitution as other forms of private speech; but it is outrightperverse when one considers that private religious expression receives preferential treatment under the Free Exercise Clause. It is no answer to say that the Establishment
Clause tempers religious speech. By its terms that Clause
applies only to the words and acts of government. It was
never meant, and has never been read by this Court, to serve
as an impediment to purely private religious speech connected to the State only through its occurrence in a public
forum.

Since petitioners' "transferred endorsement" principle
cannot possibly be restricted to squares in front of state capitols, the Establishment Clause regime that it would usher in
is most unappealing. To require (and permit) access by a
religious group in Lamb's Chapel, it was sufficient that the
group's activity was not in fact government sponsored, that
the event was open to the public, and that the benefit of the
facilities was shared by various organizations. Petitioners'
rule would require school districts adopting similar policies
in the future to guess whether some undetermined critical
mass of the community might nonetheless perceive the district to be advocating a religious viewpoint. Similarly, state
universities would be forced to reassess our statement that
"an open forum in a public university does not confer any
imprimatur of state approval on religious sects or practices."

would find themselves in a vise between the EstablishmentClause on one side and the Free Speech and Free Exercise

Clauses on the other. Every proposed act of private, reli-gious expression in a public forum would force officials to
weigh a host of imponderables. How close to governmentis too close? What kind of building, and in what context,
symbolizes state authority? If the State guessed wrong inone direction, it would be guilty of an Establishment Clause
violation; if in the other, it would be liable for suppressingfree exercise or free speech (a risk not run when the State
restrains only its own expression).The "transferred endorsement" test would also disrupt the
settled principle that policies providing incidental benefits toreligion do not contravene the Establishment Clause. That
principle is the basis for the constitutionality of a broadrange of laws, not merely those that implicate free-speech
issues, see, e. g., Witters v. Washington Dept. of Servs. forBlind, 474 U. S. 481 (1986); Mueller v. Allen, 463 U. S. 388
(1983). It has radical implications for our public policy tosuggest that neutral laws are invalid whenever hypothetical
observers may--even reasonably--confuse an incidentalbenefit to religion with state endorsement.

3 If it is true, as Justice O'Connor suggests, post, at 775, that she
would not "be likely to come to a different result from the plurality where
truly private speech is allowed on equal terms in a vigorous public forum
that the government has administered properly," then she is extending
the "endorsement test" to private speech to cover an eventuality that is
"not likely" to occur. Before doing that, it would seem desirable to explore the precise degree of the unlikelihood (is it perhaps 100%?)--for as
we point out in text, the extension to private speech has considerable
costs. Contrary to what Justice O'Connor, Justice Souter, and Justice Stevens argue, the endorsement test does not supply an appropriate
standard for the inquiry before us. It supplies no standard whatsoever.
The lower federal courts that Justice O'Connor's concurrence identifies
as having "applied the endorsement test in precisely the context before us
today," ibid., have reached precisely differing results--which is what led
the Court to take this case. And if further proof of the invited chaos

Opinion of Scalia, J.
If Ohio is concerned about misperceptions, nothing prevents it from requiring all private displays in the square
to be identified as such. That would be a content-neutral
"manner" restriction that is assuredly constitutional. See
Clark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence, 468 U. S.
288, 293 (1984). But the State may not, on the claim of misperception of official endorsement, ban all private religious
speech from the public square, or discriminate against it
by requiring religious speech alone to disclaim public
sponsorship.4

is required, one need only follow the debate between the concurrence and
Justice Stevens' dissent as to whether the hypothetical beholder who
will be the determinant of "endorsement" should be any beholder (no matter how unknowledgeable), or the average beholder, or (what Justice Stevens accuses the concurrence of favoring) the "ultrareasonable" beholder.
See post, at 778-782 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in
judgment); post, at 807-808 (Stevens, J., dissenting). And, of course,
even when one achieves agreement upon that question, it will be unrealistic to expect different judges (or should it be juries?) to reach consistent
answers as to what any beholder, the average beholder, or the ultrareasonable beholder (as the case may be) would think. It is irresponsible to
make the Nation's legislators walk this minefield.

4 For this reason, among others, we do not inquire into the adequacy of

the identification that was attached to the cross ultimately erected in this
case. The difficulties posed by such an inquiry, however, are yet another
reason to reject the principle of "transferred endorsement." The only
principled line for adequacy of identification would be identification that
is legible at whatever distance the cross is visible. Otherwise, the uninformed viewer who does not have time or inclination to come closer to
read the sign might be misled, just as (under current law) the uninformed
viewer who does not have time or inclination to inquire whether speech
in Capitol Square is publicly endorsed speech might be misled. Needless
to say, such a rule would place considerable constraint upon religious
speech, not to mention that it would be ridiculous. But if one rejects that
criterion, courts would have to decide (on what basis we cannot imagine)
how large an identifying sign is large enough. Our Religion Clause jurisprudence is complex enough without the addition of this highly litigable
feature.

* * *Religious expression cannot violate the Establishment

Clause where it (1) is purely private and (2) occurs in a tradi-tional or designated public forum, publicly announced and
open to all on equal terms. Those conditions are satisfiedhere, and therefore the State may not bar respondents' cross
from Capitol Square.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is

Affirmed.
Justice Thomas, concurring.
I join the Court's conclusion that petitioners' exclusion ofthe Ku Klux Klan's cross cannot be justified on Establishment Clause grounds. But the fact that the legal issue be-fore us involves the Establishment Clause should not lead
anyone to think that a cross erected by the Ku Klux Klan isa purely religious symbol. The erection of such a cross is a
political act, not a Christian one.There is little doubt that the Klan's main objective is to
establish a racist white government in the United States.In Klan ceremony, the cross is a symbol of white supremacy
and a tool for the intimidation and harassment of racial mi-norities, Catholics, Jews, Communists, and any other groups
hated by the Klan. The cross is associated with the Klannot because of religious worship, but because of the Klan's
practice of cross burning. Cross burning was entirely un-known to the early Ku Klux Klan, which emerged in some
Southern States during Reconstruction. W. Wade, TheFiery Cross: The Ku Klux Klan in America 146 (1987). The
practice appears to have been the product of Thomas Dixon,whose book The Clansman formed the story for the movie,
The Birth of a Nation. See M. Newton & J. Newton, TheKu Klux Klan: An Encyclopedia 145-146 (1991). In the
book, cross burning is borrowed from an "old Scottish rite"(Dixon apparently believed that the members of the Reconstruction Ku Klux Klan were the "reincarnated souls of the

Clansmen of Old Scotland") that the Klan uses to celebrate
the execution of a former slave. T. Dixon, The Clansman:
An Historical Romance of the Ku Klux Klan 324-326 (1905).
Although the cross took on some religious significance in the
1920's when the Klan became connected with certain
southern white clergy, by the postwar period it had reverted
to its original function as an instrument of intimidation.
Wade, supra, at 185, 279.

To be sure, the cross appears to serve as a religious symbol
of Christianity for some Klan members. The hymn "The
Old Rugged Cross" is sometimes played during cross burnings. See W. Moore, A Sheet and a Cross: A Symbolic Analysis of the Ku Klux Klan 287-288 (Ph.D. dissertation, Tulane
University, 1975). But to the extent that the Klan had a
message to communicate in Capitol Square, it was primarily
a political one. During his testimony before the District
Court, the leader of the local Klan testified that the cross
was seen "as a symbol of freedom, as a symbol of trying to
unite our people." App. 150. The Klan chapter wished to
erect the cross because it was also "a symbol of freedom from
tyranny," and because it "was also incorporated in the confederate battle flag." Ibid. Of course, the cross also had
some religious connotation; the Klan leader linked the cross
to what he claimed was one of the central purposes of the
Klan: "to establish a Christian government in America."
Id., at 142-145. But surely this message was both political
and religious in nature.

Although the Klan might have sought to convey a message
with some religious component, I think that the Klan had a
primarily nonreligious purpose in erecting the cross. The
Klan simply has appropriated one of the most sacred of
religious symbols as a symbol of hate. In my mind, this
suggests that this case may not have truly involved the
Establishment Clause, although I agree with the Court's
disposition because of the manner in which the case has come

before us. In the end, there may be much less here thanmeets the eye.

Justice O'Connor, with whom Justice Souter and
Justice Breyer join, concurring in part and concurring
in the judgment.

I join Parts I, II, and III of the Court's opinion and concur
in the judgment. Despite the messages of bigotry and rac-ism that may be conveyed along with religious connotations

by the display of a Ku Klux Klan cross, see ante, at 771(

Thomas, J., concurring), at bottom this case must be understood as it has been presented to us--as a case about privatereligious expression and whether the State's relationship to

it violates the Establishment Clause. In my view, "the en-dorsement test asks the right question about governmental
practices challenged on Establishment Clause grounds, including challenged practices involving the display of religious symbols," County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U. S. 573, 628
(1989) (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in
judgment), even where a neutral state policy toward private
religious speech in a public forum is at issue. Accordingly,
I see no necessity to carve out, as the plurality opinion would
today, an exception to the endorsement test for the public
forum context.

For the reasons given by Justice Souter, whose opinion
I also join, I conclude on the facts of this case that there is
"no realistic danger that the community would think that
the [State] was endorsing religion or any particular creed,"
Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School Dist.,
508 U. S. 384, 395 (1993), by granting respondents a permit
to erect their temporary cross on Capitol Square. I write
separately, however, to emphasize that, because it seeks to
identify those situations in which government makes " `adherence to a religion relevant . . . to a person's standing in
the political community,' " Allegheny, supra, at 594 (quoting

"In recent years, we have paid particularly close attention[in Establishment Clause cases] to whether the challenged

governmental practice either has the purpose or effect of`endorsing' religion, a concern that has long had a place
in our Establishment Clause jurisprudence." Allegheny,supra, at 592. See also Lamb's Chapel, supra, at 395;
School Dist. of Grand Rapids v. Ball, 473 U. S. 373, 390(1985) (asking "whether the symbolic union of church and
state effected by the challenged governmental action is suf-ficiently likely to be perceived by adherents of the controlling
denominations as an endorsement, and by the nonadherentsas a disapproval, of their individual religious choices"). A
government statement " `that religion or a particular reli-gious belief is favored or preferred,' "

Allegheny, supra, at593 (quoting Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U. S. 38, 70 (1985)

(O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment), violates the prohibi-tion against establishment of religion because such "[e]ndorsement sends a message to nonadherents that they areoutsiders, not full members of the political community, and
an accompanying message to adherents that they are insid-ers, favored members of the political community,"

Lynch,supra, at 688 (
O'Connor, J., concurring). See also Allegheny, supra, at 628 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part andconcurring in judgment); Wallace, supra, at 69 (

ate the constitutionality of religious symbols on public prop-erty. See

Allegheny, supra, at 593-594.
While the plurality would limit application of the endorse-ment test to "expression

by the government itself, . . . or else
government action alleged to discriminate in favor of private religious expression or activity," ante, at 764, I believethat an impermissible message of endorsement can be sent

in a variety of contexts, not all of which involve direct gov-ernment speech or outright favoritism. See

infra, at 777-
778. It is true that neither Allegheny nor Lynch, our twoprior religious display cases, involved the same combination of

private religious speech and a public forum that we have before us today. Nonetheless, as Justice Souter aptly demonstrates, post, at 786-792, we have on several occasions employed an endorsement perspective in Establishment Clause
cases where private religious conduct has intersected with
a neutral governmental policy providing some benefit in a
manner that parallels the instant case. Thus, while I join the
discussion of Lamb's Chapel and Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U. S.
263 (1981), in Part III of the Court's opinion, I do so with full
recognition that the factors the Court properly identifies ultimately led in each case to the conclusion that there was no
endorsement of religion by the State. Lamb's Chapel, supra,
at 395; Widmar, supra, at 274. See also post, at 790-791
(Souter, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).

There is, as the plurality notes, ante, at 765, "a crucial
difference between government speech endorsing religion,
which the Establishment Clause forbids, and private speech
endorsing religion, which the Free Speech and Free Exercise
Clauses protect." Board of Ed. of Westside Community
Schools (Dist. 66) v. Mergens, 496 U. S. 226, 250 (1990) (plurality opinion). But the quoted statement was made while
applying the endorsement test itself; indeed, the sentence
upon which the plurality relies was followed immediately by
the conclusion that "secondary school students are mature
enough and are likely to understand that a school does not

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
endorse or support student speech that it merely permitson a nondiscriminatory basis."

Ibid. Thus, as I read the
decisions Justice Souter carefully surveys, our prior casesdo not imply that the endorsement test has no place where

private religious speech in a public forum is at issue. Moreover, numerous lower courts (including the Court of Appealsin this case) have applied the endorsement test in precisely

the context before us today. See, e. g., Chabad-Lubavitch
of Georgia v. Miller, 5 F. 3d 1383 (CA11 1993) (en banc);
Kreisner v. San Diego, 1 F. 3d 775, 782-787 (CA9 1993), cert.denied, 510 U. S. 1044 (1994);

Americans United for Separation of Church and State v. Grand Rapids, 980 F. 2d 1538
(CA6 1992) (en banc); Doe v. Small, 964 F. 2d 611 (CA7 1992)
(en banc); cf. Smith v. County of Albemarle, 895 F. 2d 953
(CA4), cert. denied, 498 U. S. 823 (1990); Kaplan v. Burlington, 891 F. 2d 1024 (CA2 1989), cert. denied, 496 U. S. 926
(1990). Given this background, I see no necessity to draw
new lines where "[r]eligious expression . . . (1) is purely private and (2) occurs in a traditional or designated public
forum," ante, at 770.

None of this is to suggest that I would be likely to come
to a different result from the plurality where truly private
speech is allowed on equal terms in a vigorous public forum
that the government has administered properly. That the
religious display at issue here was erected by a private
group in a public square available "for use by the public . . .
for free discussion of public questions, or for activities of a
broad public purpose," Ohio Admin. Code Ann. $ 128-4-
02(A) (1994), certainly informs the Establishment Clause
inquiry under the endorsement test. Indeed, many of the
factors the plurality identifies are some of those I would
consider important in deciding cases like this one where religious speakers seek access to public spaces: "The State did
not sponsor respondents' expression, the expression was
made on government property that had been opened to the
public for speech, and permission was requested through the

Opinion of O'Connor, J.

same application process and on the same terms required ofother private groups."

Ante, at 763. And, as I read the
plurality opinion, a case is not governed by its proposed per
se rule where such circumstances are otherwise--that is,
where preferential placement of a religious symbol in a
public space or government manipulation of the forum isinvolved. See

ante, at 766.
To the plurality's consideration of the open nature of theforum and the private ownership of the display, however, I

would add the presence of a sign disclaiming governmentsponsorship or endorsement on the Klan cross, which would
make the State's role clear to the community. This factor
is important because, as Justice Souter makes clear, post,
at 785-786, certain aspects of the cross display in this case
arguably intimate government approval of respondents'
private religious message--particularly that the cross is an
especially potent sectarian symbol which stood unattended in
close proximity to official government buildings. In context,
a disclaimer helps remove doubt about state approval of
respondents' religious message. Cf. Widmar, supra, at 274,
n. 14 ("In light of the large number of groups meeting on
campus, however, we doubt students could draw any reasonable inference of University support from the mere fact of a
campus meeting place. The University's student handbook
already notes that the University's name will not `be identified in any way with the aims, policies, programs, products,
or opinions of any organization or its members' "). On these
facts, then, "the message [of inclusion] is one of neutrality
rather than endorsement." Mergens, supra, at 248 (plurality opinion).

Our agreement as to the outcome of this case, however,
cannot mask the fact that I part company with the plurality
on a fundamental point: I disagree that "[i]t has radical implications for our public policy to suggest that neutral laws are
invalid whenever hypothetical observers may--even reasonably--confuse an incidental benefit to religion with state

777Cite as: 515 U. S. 753 (1995)
Opinion of O'Connor, J.
endorsement." Ante, at 768. On the contrary, when thereasonable observer would view a government practice as

endorsing religion, I believe that it is our duty to hold thepractice invalid. The plurality today takes an exceedingly
narrow view of the Establishment Clause that is out of step
both with the Court's prior cases and with well-establishednotions of what the Constitution requires. The Clause is

more than a negative prohibition against certain narrowlydefined forms of government favoritism, see

ante, at 766;
it also imposes affirmative obligations that may require aState, in some situations, to take steps to avoid being perceived as supporting or endorsing a private religious message. That is, the Establishment Clause forbids a State to
hide behind the application of formally neutral criteria and
remain studiously oblivious to the effects of its actions.
Governmental intent cannot control, and not all state policies
are permissible under the Religion Clauses simply because
they are neutral in form.

Where the government's operation of a public forum has
the effect of endorsing religion, even if the governmental
actor neither intends nor actively encourages that result, see
Lynch, 465 U. S., at 690 (O'Connor, J., concurring), the Establishment Clause is violated. This is so not because of
" `transferred endorsement,' " ante, at 764, or mistaken attribution of private speech to the State, but because the State's
own actions (operating the forum in a particular manner and
permitting the religious expression to take place therein),
and their relationship to the private speech at issue, actually
convey a message of endorsement. At some point, for example, a private religious group may so dominate a public forum
that a formal policy of equal access is transformed into a
demonstration of approval. Cf. Mergens, 454 U. S., at 275
(concluding that there was no danger of an Establishment
Clause violation in a public university's allowing access by
student religious groups to facilities available to others "[a]t
least in the absence of empirical evidence that religious

groups will dominate [the school's] open forum"). Other cir-cumstances may produce the same effect--whether because

of the fortuity of geography, the nature of the particular pub-lic space, or the character of the religious speech at issue,
among others. Our Establishment Clause jurisprudenceshould remain flexible enough to handle such situations when
they arise.In the end, I would recognize that the Establishment
Clause inquiry cannot be distilled into a fixed, per se rule.Thus, "[e]very government practice must be judged in its
unique circumstances to determine whether it constitutes anendorsement or disapproval of religion."

Lynch, 465 U. S.,at 694 (
O'Connor, J., concurring). And this question cannotbe answered in the abstract, but instead requires courts to

examine the history and administration of a particular prac-tice to determine whether it operates as such an endorsement. I continue to believe that government practices re-lating to speech on religious topics "must be subjected to
careful judicial scrutiny," ibid., and that the endorsementtest supplies an appropriate standard for that inquiry.

II
Conducting the review of government action required bythe Establishment Clause is always a sensitive matter. Unfortunately, as I noted in Allegheny, "even the developmentof articulable standards and guidelines has not always resulted in agreement among the Members of this Court onthe results in individual cases." 492 U. S., at 623. Today,
Justice Stevens reaches a different conclusion regardingwhether the Board's decision to allow respondents' display
on Capitol Square constituted an impermissible endorsementof the cross' religious message. Yet I believe it is important
to note that we have not simply arrived at divergent resultsafter conducting the same analysis. Our fundamental point
of departure, it appears, concerns the knowledge that isproperly attributed to the test's "reasonable observer [who]

515us3$90j 08-18-98 09:06:45 PAGES OPINPGT

779Cite as: 515 U. S. 753 (1995)
Opinion of O'Connor, J.
evaluates whether a challenged governmental practice con-veys a message of endorsement of religion."

Id., at 630
(O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judg-ment). In my view, proper application of the endorsement

test requires that the reasonable observer be deemed more
informed than the casual passerby postulated by Justice
Stevens.

Because an Establishment Clause violation must bemoored in government action of some sort, and because our

concern is with the political community writ large, see Allegheny, supra, at 627 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and
concurring in judgment); Lynch, supra, at 690, the endorsement inquiry is not about the perceptions of particular individuals or saving isolated nonadherents from the discomfort
of viewing symbols of a faith to which they do not subscribe.
Indeed, to avoid "entirely sweep[ing] away all government
recognition and acknowledgment of the role of religion in the
lives of our citizens," Allegheny, supra, at 623 (O'Connor,
J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), our Establishment Clause jurisprudence must seek to identify the
point at which the government becomes responsible, whether
due to favoritism toward or disregard for the evident effect
of religious speech, for the injection of religion into the political life of the citizenry.

I therefore disagree that the endorsement test should
focus on the actual perception of individual observers, who
naturally have differing degrees of knowledge. Under such
an approach, a religious display is necessarily precluded so
long as some passersby would perceive a governmental endorsement thereof. In my view, however, the endorsement
test creates a more collective standard to gauge "the `objective' meaning of the [government's] statement in the community," Lynch, supra, at 690 (O'Connor, J., concurring). In
this respect, the applicable observer is similar to the "reasonable person" in tort law, who "is not to be identified with any
ordinary individual, who might occasionally do unreasonable

things," but is "rather a personification of a community idealof reasonable behavior, determined by the [collective] social

judgment." W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen,Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts 175 (5th ed. 1984).
Thus, "we do not ask whether there is any person who could
find an endorsement of religion, whether some people maybe offended by the display, or whether

some reasonable person might think [the State] endorses religion." Americans
United, 980 F. 2d, at 1544. Saying that the endorsement
inquiry should be conducted from the perspective of a hypo-thetical observer who is presumed to possess a certain level

of information that all citizens might not share neither
chooses the perceptions of the majority over those of a "reasonable non-adherent," cf. L. Tribe, American Constitutional
Law 1293 (2d ed. 1988), nor invites disregard for the values
the Establishment Clause was intended to protect. It simply recognizes the fundamental difficulty inherent in focusing
on actual people: There is always someone who, with a particular quantum of knowledge, reasonably might perceive a
particular action as an endorsement of religion. A State has
not made religion relevant to standing in the political community simply because a particular viewer of a display might
feel uncomfortable.

It is for this reason that the reasonable observer in the
endorsement inquiry must be deemed aware of the history
and context of the community and forum in which the religious display appears. As I explained in Allegheny, "the

`history and ubiquity' of a practice is relevant because it provides part of the context in which a reasonable observer
evaluates whether a challenged governmental practice conveys a message of endorsement of religion." 492 U. S., at
630. Nor can the knowledge attributed to the reasonable
observer be limited to the information gleaned simply from
viewing the challenged display. Today's proponents of the
endorsement test all agree that we should attribute to the
observer knowledge that the cross is a religious symbol, that

Capitol Square is owned by the State, and that the largebuilding nearby is the seat of state government. See

post,
at 792-793 (Souter, J., concurring in part and concurring injudgment);

post, at 806 (Stevens, J., dissenting). In my
view, our hypothetical observer also should know the general
history of the place in which the cross is displayed. Indeed,the fact that Capitol Square is a public park that has been

used over time by private speakers of various types is asmuch a part of the display's context as its proximity to the
Ohio Statehouse. Cf. Allegheny, supra, at 600, n. 50 (notingthat "[t]he Grand Staircase does not appear to be the kind of
location in which all were free to place their displays for
weeks at a time"). This approach does not require us to
assume an " `ultrareasonable observer' who understands the
vagaries of this Court's First Amendment jurisprudence,"
post, at 807 (Stevens, J., dissenting). An informed member
of the community will know how the public space in question
has been used in the past--and it is that fact, not that the
space may meet the legal definition of a public forum, which
is relevant to the endorsement inquiry.

Justice Stevens' property-based argument fails to give
sufficient weight to the fact that the cross at issue here was
displayed in a forum traditionally open to the public. "The
very fact that a sign is installed on public property," his dissent suggests, "implies official recognition and reinforcement
of its message." Post, at 801. While this may be the case
where a government building and its immediate curtilage are
involved, it is not necessarily so with respect to those "places
which by long tradition or by government fiat have been devoted to assembly and debate, . . . [particularly] streets and
parks which `have immemorially been held in trust for the
use of the public and, time out of mind, have been used for
purposes of assembly, communicating thoughts between citizens, and discussing public questions.' " Perry Ed. Assn. v.

U. S. 496, 515 (1939)). To the extent there is a presumptionthat "structures on government property--and, in particular, in front of buildings plainly identified with the State--imply state approval of their message," post, at 804 (

Stevens, J., dissenting), that presumption can be rebuttedwhere the property at issue is a forum historically available

for private expression. The reasonable observer wouldrecognize the distinction between speech the government
supports and speech that it merely allows in a place thattraditionally has been open to a range of private speakers
accompanied, if necessary, by an appropriate disclaimer.In this case, I believe, the reasonable observer would view
the Klan's cross display fully aware that Capitol Square is apublic space in which a multiplicity of groups, both secular
and religious, engage in expressive conduct. It is preciselythis type of knowledge that we presumed in Lamb's Chapel,
508 U. S., at 395, and in Mergens, 496 U. S., at 250 (pluralityopinion). Moreover, this observer would certainly be able
to read and understand an adequate disclaimer, which theKlan had informed the State it would include in the display
at the time it applied for the permit, see App. to Pet. forCert. A15-A16;

post, at 793-794, n. 1 (Souter, J., concurringin part and concurring in judgment), and the content of

which the Board could have defined as it deemed necessaryas a condition of granting the Klan's application. Cf. American Civil Liberties Union v. Wilkinson, 895 F. 2d 1098,1104-1106 (CA6 1990). On the facts of this case, therefore,
I conclude that the reasonable observer would not interpretthe State's tolerance of the Klan's private religious display
in Capitol Square as an endorsement of religion.

it may not always yield results with unanimous agreementat the margins."

Allegheny, 492 U. S., at 629 (O'Connor,
J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). In myview, however, this flexibility is a virtue and not a vice;

"courts must keep in mind both the fundamental place held
by the Establishment Clause in our constitutional scheme
and the myriad, subtle ways in which Establishment Clause
values can be eroded," Lynch, 465 U. S., at 694 (O'Connor,
J., concurring).

I agree that "compliance with the Establishment Clause is
a state interest sufficiently compelling to justify contentbased restrictions on speech." Ante, at 761-762. The Establishment Clause "prohibits government from appearing to
take a position on questions of religious belief or from `making adherence to a religion relevant in any way to a person's
standing in the political community.' " Allegheny, supra, at
593-594 (quoting Lynch, supra, at 687 (O'Connor, J., concurring)). Because I believe that, under the circumstances at
issue here, allowing the Klan cross, along with an adequate
disclaimer, to be displayed on Capitol Square presents no
danger of doing so, I conclude that the State has not presented a compelling justification for denying respondents
their permit.

Justice Souter, with whom Justice O'Connor and
Justice Breyer join, concurring in part and concurring
in the judgment.

I concur in Parts I, II, and III of the Court's opinion. I
also want to note specifically my agreement with the Court's
suggestion that the State of Ohio could ban all unattended
private displays in Capitol Square if it so desired. See ante,
at 761; see also post, at 802-804 (Stevens, J., dissenting).
The fact that the capitol lawn has been the site of public protests and gatherings, and is the location of any number of the
government's own unattended displays, such as statues, does

not disable the State from closing the square to all privatelyowned, unattended structures. A government entity may

ban posters on publicly owned utility poles to eliminate vis-ual clutter,

Members of City Council of Los Angeles v. Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U. S. 789, 808 (1984), and may bar
camping as part of a demonstration in certain public parks,
Clark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence, 468 U. S.
288 (1984). It may similarly adopt a content-neutral policyprohibiting private individuals and groups from erecting

unattended displays in forums around public buildings. See
Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U. S. 781, 791 (1989)
("[E]ven in a public forum the government may impose reasonable restrictions on the time, place, or manner of protected speech, provided [that] the restrictions `are justified
without reference to the content of the regulated speech,
that they are narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest, and that they leave open ample alternative
channels for communication of the information,' " quoting
Clark, supra, at 293).

Otherwise, however, I limit my concurrence to the judgment. Although I agree in the end that, in the circumstances of this case, petitioners erred in denying the Klan's
application for a permit to erect a cross on Capitol Square,
my analysis of the Establishment Clause issue differs from
Justice Scalia's, and I vote to affirm in large part because
of the possibility of affixing a sign to the cross adequately
disclaiming any government sponsorship or endorsement of
it.

The plurality's opinion declines to apply the endorsement
test to the Board's action, in favor of a per se rule: religious
expression cannot violate the Establishment Clause where it
(1) is private and (2) occurs in a public forum, even if a reasonable observer would see the expression as indicating
state endorsement. Ante, at 770. This per se rule would
be an exception to the endorsement test, not previously recognized and out of square with our precedents.

I
My disagreement with the plurality on the law may re-ceive some focus from attention to a matter of straight fact

that we see alike: in some circumstances an intelligent ob-server may mistake private, unattended religious displays in
a public forum for government speech endorsing religion.See

ante, at 768 (acknowledging that "hypothetical observersmay--even reasonably--confuse an incidental benefit to religion with state endorsement") (emphasis in original); seealso

ante, at 769, n. 4 (noting that an observer might be "mis-led" by the presence of the cross in Capitol Square if the

disclaimer was of insufficient size or if the observer failed toenquire whether the State had sponsored the cross). The
Klan concedes this possibility as well, saying that, in its view,"on a different set of facts, the government might be found
guilty of violating the endorsement test by permitting aprivate religious display in a public forum." Brief for
Respondents 43.An observer need not be "obtuse,"

Doe v. Small, 964 F. 2d611, 630 (CA7 1992) (Easterbrook, J., concurring), to presume

that an unattended display on government land in a place ofprominence in front of a government building either belongs
to the government, represents government speech, or enjoysits location because of government endorsement of its message. Capitol Square, for example, is the site of a number ofunattended displays owned or sponsored by the government,
some permanent (statues), some temporary (such as theChristmas tree and a "Seasons Greetings" banner), and some
in between (flags, which are, presumably, taken down andput up from time to time). See App. 59, 64-65 (photos); Appendices A and B to this opinion, infra. Given the domina-tion of the square by the government's own displays, one
would not be a dimwit as a matter of law to think that anunattended religious display there was endorsed by the
government, even though the square has also been the siteof three privately sponsored, unattended displays over the

years (a menorah, a United Way "thermometer," and someartisans' booths left overnight during an arts festival), ante,

at 758, cf. County of Allegheny v. American Civil LibertiesUnion, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U. S. 573, 600, n. 50
(1989) ("Even if the Grand Staircase occasionally was usedfor displays other than the cre` che . . . , it remains true that
any display located there fairly may be understood to ex-press views that receive the support and endorsement of the
government"), and even though the square meets the legaldefinition of a public forum and has been used "[f]or over a
century" as the site of "speeches, gatherings, and festivals,"
ante, at 757. When an individual speaks in a public forum,it is reasonable for an observer to attribute the speech, first

and foremost, to the speaker, while an unattended display(and any message it conveys) can naturally be viewed as
belonging to the owner of the land on which it stands.In sum, I do not understand that I am at odds with the
plurality when I assume that in some circumstances an intel-ligent observer would reasonably perceive private religious
expression in a public forum to imply the government's en-dorsement of religion. My disagreement with the plurality
is simply that I would attribute these perceptions of the in-telligent observer to the reasonable observer of Establishment Clause analysis under our precedents, where I believethat such reasonable perceptions matter.

In Allegheny, the Court alluded to two elements ofthe analytical framework supplied by Lemon v. Kurtzman,

403 U. S. 602 (1971), by asking "whether the challengedgovernmental practice either has the purpose or effect of
`endorsing' religion." 492 U. S., at 592. We said that "theprohibition against governmental endorsement of religion
`preclude[s] government from conveying or attempting toconvey a message that religion or a particular religious belief
is favored or preferred,' " id., at 593, quoting Wallace v. Jaf515us3$90m 08-18-98 09:06:45 PAGES OPINPGT

free, 472 U. S. 38, 70 (1985) (O'Connor, J., concurring in judg-ment) (emphasis deleted), and held that "[t]he Establishment

Clause, at the very least, prohibits government from appear-ing to take a position on questions of religious belief," 492
U. S., at 593-594.

Allegheny's endorsement test cannot be dismissed, as Justice Scalia suggests, as applying only to situations in which
there is an allegation that the Establishment Clause hasbeen violated through "expression by the government itself "

or "government action . . . discriminat[ing] in favor of privatereligious expression."

Ante, at 764 (emphasis deleted).
Such a distinction would, in all but a handful of cases, make
meaningless the "effect-of-endorsing" part of Allegheny's
test. Effects matter to the Establishment Clause, and one,
principal way that we assess them is by asking whether the
practice in question creates the appearance of endorsement to
the reasonable observer. See Allegheny, supra, at 630, 635-
636 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); Witters v. Washington Dept. of Servs. for Blind, 474
U. S. 481, 493 (1986) (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and
concurring in judgment); see also Allegheny, supra, at 593-
594, 599-600 (majority opinion); Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U. S.
668, 690 (1984) (O'Connor, J., concurring). If a reasonable
observer would perceive a religious display in a government
forum as government speech endorsing religion, then the
display has made "religion relevant, in . . . public perception,
to status in the political community." Id., at 692 (O'Connor, J., concurring). Unless we are to retreat entirely to
government intent and abandon consideration of effects, it
makes no sense to recognize a public perception of endorsement as a harm only in that subclass of cases in which the
government owns the display. Indeed, the Court stated in
Allegheny that "once the judgment has been made that a
particular proclamation of Christian belief, when disseminated from a particular location on government property, has
the effect of demonstrating the government's endorsement

of Christian faith, then it necessarily follows that the practicemust be enjoined." 492 U. S., at 612. Notably, we did not

say that it was only a "particular government proclamation"that could have such an unconstitutional effect, nor does the
passage imply anything of the kind.

The significance of the fact that the Court in Alleghenydid not intend to lay down a

per se rule in the way suggested
by the plurality today has been confirmed by subsequentcases. In

Board of Ed. of Westside Community Schools
(Dist. 66) v. Mergens, 496 U. S. 226 (1990), six Justices ap-plied the endorsement test to decide whether the Establishment Clause would be violated by a public high school's application of the Equal Access Act, Pub. L. 98-377, 98 Stat.
1302, 20 U. S. C. $$ 4071-4074, to allow students to form a
religious club having the same access to meeting facilities
as other "noncurricular" groups organized by students. A
plurality of four Justices concluded that such an equal access
policy "does not convey a message of state approval or endorsement of the particular religion" espoused by the student religious group. 496 U. S., at 252 (O'Connor, J., joined
by Rehnquist, C. J., and White and Blackmun, JJ.). Two
others concurred in the judgment in order "to emphasize the
steps [the school] must take to avoid appearing to endorse
the [religious] club's goals." Id., at 263 (opinion of Marshall,
J., joined by Brennan, J.); see also id., at 264 ("If public
schools are perceived as conferring the imprimatur of the
State on religious doctrine or practice as a result of such a
policy, the nominally `neutral' character of the policy will not
save it from running afoul of the Establishment Clause")
(emphasis in original).

What is important is that, even though Mergens involved
private religious speech in a nondiscriminatory " `limited
open forum,' " id., at 233, 247, a majority of the Court
reached the conclusion in the case not by applying an irrebuttable presumption, as the plurality does today, but by making a contextual judgment taking account of the circum515us3$90m 08-18-98 09:06:45 PAGES OPINPGT

stances of the specific case. See id., at 250-252 (pluralityopinion);

id., at 264-270 (opinion of Marshall, J., joined by
Brennan, J.); cf. Allegheny, 492 U. S., at 629 (O'Connor, J.,concurring in part and concurring in judgment) ("[T]he endorsement test depends on a sensitivity to the unique circumstances and context of a particular challenged practice");
Lynch, supra, at 694 (O'Connor, J., concurring) ("Every
government practice must be judged in its unique circum-stances to determine whether it constitutes an endorsement

or disapproval of religion"). The Mergens plurality consid-ered the nature of the likely audience, 496 U. S., at 250
("[S]econdary school students are mature enough . . . to understand that a school does not endorse or support student
speech that it merely permits on a nondiscriminatory basis");
the details of the particular forum, id., at 252 (noting "the
broad spectrum of officially recognized student clubs" at the
school, and the students' freedom "to initiate and organize
additional student clubs"); the presumptively secular nature
of most student organizations, ibid. (" `[I]n the absence of
empirical evidence that religious groups will dominate [the]
. . . open forum, . . . the advancement of religion would not
be the forum's "primary effect," ' " quoting Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U. S. 263, 275 (1981)); and the school's specific action
or inaction that would disassociate itself from any religious
message, 496 U. S., at 251 ("[N]o school officials actively participate" in the religious group's activities). The plurality,
moreover, expressly relied on the fact that the school could
issue a disclaimer specific to the religious group, concluding
that "[t]o the extent a school makes clear that its recognition
of [a religious student group] is not an endorsement . . . ,
students will reasonably understand that the . . . recognition of the club evinces neutrality toward, rather than endorsement of, religious speech." Ibid.; see also id., at 270
(Marshall, J., concurring in judgment) (noting importance
of schools "taking whatever further steps are necessary
to make clear that their recognition of a religious club does

not reflect their endorsement of the views of the club'sparticipants").

Similarly, in Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union
Free School Dist., 508 U. S. 384 (1993), we held that an evangelical church, wanting to use public school property to show
a series of films about child rearing with a religious perspec-tive, could not be refused access to the premises under a

policy that would open the school to other groups showingsimilar films from a nonreligious perspective. In reaching
this conclusion, we expressly concluded that the policy would"not have the principal or primary effect of advancing or
inhibiting religion." 508 U. S., at 395. Again we looked to
the specific circumstances of the private religious speech and
the public forum: the film would not be shown during school
hours or be sponsored by the school, it would be open to the
public, and the forum had been used "repeatedly" by "a wide
variety" of other private speakers. Ibid. "Under these circumstances," we concluded, "there would have been no realistic danger that the community would think that the [school]
was endorsing religion." Ibid. We thus expressly looked
to the endorsement effects of the private religious speech at
issue, notwithstanding the fact that there was no allegation
that the Establishment Clause had been violated through
active "expression by the government itself " or affirmative
"government action . . . discriminat[ing] in favor of private
religious expression." Ante, at 764 (emphasis deleted). Indeed, the issue of whether the private religious speech in a
government forum had the effect of advancing religion was
central, rather than irrelevant, to our Establishment Clause
enquiry. This is why I agree with the Court that "[t]he
Lamb's Chapel reasoning applies a fortiori here," ante, at 762.

Widmar v. Vincent, supra, is not to the contrary. Although Widmar was decided before our adoption of the endorsement test in Allegheny, its reasoning fits with such a
test and not with the per se rule announced today. There,
in determining whether it would violate the Establishment

Clause to allow private religious speech in a "generally openforum" at a university, 454 U. S., at 269, the Court looked to

the Lemon test, 454 U. S., at 271, and focused on the "effects"prong,

id., at 272, in reaching a contextual judgment. It was
relevant that university students "should be able to appreciate that the University's policy is one of neutrality towardreligion," that students were unlikely, as a matter of fact, to

"draw any reasonable inference of University support fromthe mere fact of a campus meeting place," and that the University's student handbook carried a disclaimer that the Uni-versity should not " `be identified in any way with the . . .
opinions of any [student] organization.' " Id., at 274, n. 14.
"In this context," id., at 273, and in the "absence of empirical
evidence that religious groups [would] dominate [the] open
forum," id., at 275, the Court found that the forum at issue
did not "confer any imprimatur of state approval on religious
sects or practices," id., at 274.

Even if precedent and practice were otherwise, however,
and there were an open question about applying the endorsement test to private speech in public forums, I would apply it
in preference to the plurality's view, which creates a serious
loophole in the protection provided by the endorsement test.
In Justice Scalia's view, as I understand it, the Establishment Clause is violated in a public forum only when the government itself intentionally endorses religion or willfully
"foster[s]" a misperception of endorsement in the forum,
ante, at 766, or when it "manipulates" the public forum "in
such a manner that only certain religious groups take advantage of it," ibid. If the list of forbidden acts is truly this
short, then governmental bodies and officials are left with
generous scope to encourage a multiplicity of religious
speakers to erect displays in public forums. As long as the
governmental entity does not "manipulat[e]" the forum in
such a way as to exclude all other speech, the plurality's
opinion would seem to invite such government encouragement, even when the result will be the domination of the

forum by religious displays and religious speakers. Byallowing government to encourage what it cannot do on its

own, the proposed per se rule would tempt a public body tocontract out its establishment of religion, by encouraging the
private enterprise of the religious to exhibit what the gov-ernment could not display itself.

Something of the sort, in fact, may have happened here.Immediately after the District Court issued the injunction
ordering petitioners to grant the Klan's permit, a localchurch council applied for a permit, apparently for the purpose of overwhelming the Klan's cross with other crosses.The council proposed to invite all local churches to erect
crosses, and the Board granted "blanket permission" for "allchurches friendly to or affiliated with" the council to do so.
See Brief in Opposition RA24-RA26. The end result wasthat a part of the square was strewn with crosses, see Appendices A and B to this opinion, infra, at 795-796, and whilethe effect in this case may have provided more embarrassment than suspicion of endorsement, the opportunity for thelatter is clear.

III
As for the specifics of this case, one must admit that anumber of facts known to the Board, or reasonably anticipated, weighed in favor of upholding its denial of the permit.For example, the Latin cross the Klan sought to erect is the
principal symbol of Christianity around the world, and dis-play of the cross alone could not reasonably be taken to have
any secular point. It was displayed immediately in front ofthe Ohio Statehouse, with the government's flags flying
nearby, and the government's statues close at hand. For
much of the time the cross was supposed to stand on thesquare, it would have been the only private display on the

public plot (the menorah's permit expired several days beforethe cross actually went up). See Pet. for Cert. A15-A16,
A31; 30 F. 3d, at 677. There was nothing else on the state515us3$90m 08-18-98 09:06:46 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of Souter, J.
house lawn that would have suggested a forum open to any
and all private, unattended religious displays.

Based on these and other factors, the Board was understandably concerned about a possible Establishment Clause
violation if it had granted the permit. But a flat denial of
the Klan's application was not the Board's only option to protect against an appearance of endorsement, and the Board
was required to find its most "narrowly drawn" alternative,
Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators' Assn., 460 U. S.
37, 45 (1983); see also ante, at 761. Either of two possibilities would have been better suited to this situation. In support of the Klan's application, its representative stated in a
letter to the Board that the cross would be accompanied by
a disclaimer, legible "from a distance," explaining that the
cross was erected by private individuals " `without government support.' " App. 118. The letter said that "the contents of the sign" were "open to negotiation." Ibid.1 The

1 This description of the disclaimer, as well as the agreement to negotiate, also appeared in the Klan's District Court complaint, App. 26, and in
stipulations of fact jointly filed in the District Court by both parties, id.,
at 100, || 32. The Klan conceded before the District Court that "the state
could have required . . . a disclaimer" like the one proposed, Memorandum
in Support of Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction
in No. C2-93-1162 (SD Ohio), p. 5, and the State assumed throughout the
litigation that the display would include the disclaimer, see, e. g., Memorandum of Defendants in Opposition to Plaintiffs's Motion for Temporary Restraining Order and for Preliminary Injunction in No. C2-93-1162 (SD
Ohio), pp. 6, 21. Both parties considered the disclaimer as an integral
part of the display that the Klan desired to place on Capitol Square. Thus
the District Court's order, which did not expressly require the disclaimer
in awarding the injunction, see Pet. for Cert. A26 ("Plaintiffs are entitled
to an injunction requiring the defendants to issue a permit to erect a cross
on Capitol Square"), cannot reasonably be read to mean that the disclaimer
was unnecessary. Indeed, in both its findings of fact and conclusions of

Board, then, could have granted the application subject tothe condition that the Klan attach a disclaimer sufficiently

large and clear to preclude any reasonable inference that thecross was there to "demonstrat[e] the government's allegiance to, or endorsement of, the Christian faith." Allegheny, 492 U. S., at 612.2 In the alternative, the Board couldhave instituted a policy of restricting all private, unattended

displays to one area of the square, with a permanent signmarking the area as a forum for private speech carrying no
endorsement from the State.With such alternatives available, the Board cannot claim
that its flat denial was a narrowly tailored response to theKlan's permit application and thus cannot rely on that denial
as necessary to ensure that the State did not "appea[r] totake a position on questions of religious belief."

Id., at 594.For these reasons, I concur in the judgment.

based on the assumption that a disclaimer would accompany the cross,
since the cross the Klan put up on the basis of the District Court's command in fact carried a disclaimer, see App. 63 (photo); Appendix to opinion
of Stevens, J., post, at 816. Since the litigation preceded the appearance
of the cross and the sign, the adequacy of the sign actually produced was
not considered. The adequacy of a disclaimer, in size as well as content,
is, of course, a proper subject of judicial scrutiny when placed in issue.
Whether the flimsy cardboard sign attached by the Klan to the base of
the cross functioned as an adequate disclaimer in this case is a question
not before us.

2 Of course, the presence of a disclaimer does not always remove the

possibility that a private religious display "convey[s] or attempt[s] to convey a message that religion or a particular religious belief is favored or
preferred," Allegheny, 492 U. S., at 593 (emphasis, internal quotation
marks, and citation omitted), when other indicia of endorsement (e. g., objective indications that the government in fact invited the display or otherwise intended to further a religious purpose) outweigh the mitigating
effect of the disclaimer, or when the disclaimer itself does not sufficiently
disclaim government support. See, e. g., Stone v. Graham, 449 U. S. 39,
41 (1980); Allegheny, supra, at 600-601; cf. ante, at 769, n. 4. In this case,
however, there is no reason to presume that an adequate disclaimer could
not have been drafted. Cf. Parish, Private Religious Displays in Public
Fora, 61 U. Chi. L. Rev. 253, 285-287 (1994).

Justice Stevens, dissenting.
The Establishment Clause should be construed to createa strong presumption against the installation of unattended

religious symbols on public property. Although the State ofOhio has allowed Capitol Square, the area around the seat of
its government, to be used as a public forum, and althoughit has occasionally allowed private groups to erect other
sectarian displays there, neither fact provides a sufficientbasis for rebutting that presumption. On the contrary,
the sequence of sectarian displays disclosed by the recordin this case illustrates the importance of rebuilding the "wall
of separation between church and State" that Jeffersonenvisioned.

1

I
At issue in this case is an unadorned Latin cross, whichthe Ku Klux Klan placed, and left unattended, on the lawn

in front of the Ohio State Capitol. The Court decides thiscase on the assumption that the cross was a religious symbol.
I agree with that assumption notwithstanding the hybridcharacter of this particular object. The record indicates
that the "Grand Titan of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klanfor the Realm of Ohio" applied for a permit to place a cross in
front of the state capitol because " `the Jews' " were placing a"symbol for the Jewish belief " in the square. App. 173.

2

Some observers, unaware of who had sponsored the cross, orunfamiliar with the history of the Klan and its reaction to the

menorah, might interpret the Klan's cross as an inspirationalsymbol of the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus Christ.

1 See Reynolds v. United States, 98 U. S. 145, 164 (1879).
2 The "Grand Titan" apparently was referring to a menorah that a

private group placed in the square during the season of Chanukah. App.
98; see infra, at 808-809. The Klan found the menorah offensive. The
Klan's cross, in turn, offended a number of observers. It was vandalized
the day after it was erected, and a local church group applied for, and was
granted, permission to display its own crosses around the Klan's to protest
the latter's presence. See Record 31.

Stevens, J., dissenting

More knowledgeable observers might regard it, given the
context, as an antisemitic symbol of bigotry and disrespect
for a particular religious sect. Under the first interpretation, the cross is plainly a religious symbol.3 Under the second, an icon of intolerance expressing an anticlerical message
should also be treated as a religious symbol because the Establishment Clause must prohibit official sponsorship of irreligious as well as religious messages. See Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U. S. 38, 52 (1985). This principle is no less binding
if the antireligious message is also a bigoted message. See
United States v. Ballard, 322 U. S. 78, 86-89 (1944) (government lacks power to judge truth of religious beliefs); Watson
v. Jones, 13 Wall. 679, 728 (1872) ("The law knows no heresy,
and is committed to the support of no dogma, the establishment of no sect").

Thus, while this unattended, freestanding wooden cross
was unquestionably a religious symbol, observers may well
have received completely different messages from that symbol. Some might have perceived it as a message of love,
others as a message of hate, still others as a message of exclusion--a statehouse sign calling powerfully to mind their
outsider status. In any event, it was a message that the
State of Ohio may not communicate to its citizens without
violating the Establishment Clause.

3 Indeed, the Latin cross is identifiable as a symbol of a particular religion, that of Christianity; and, further, as a symbol of particular denominations within Christianity. See American Civil Liberties Union v. St.
Charles, 794 F. 2d 265, 271 (CA7 1986) ("Such a display is not only religious
but also sectarian. This is not just because some religious Americans are
not Christians. Some Protestant sects still do not display the cross . . . .
The Greek Orthodox church uses as its symbol the Greek (equilateral)
cross, not the Latin cross. . . . [T]he more sectarian the display, the closer
it is to the original targets of the [establishment] clause, so the more
strictly is the clause applied").

The plurality does not disagree with the proposition thatthe State may not espouse a religious message.

Ante, at765-766. It concludes, however, that the State has not sent

such a message; it has merely allowed others to do so onits property. Thus, the State has provided an "incidental
benefit" to religion by allowing private parties access to atraditional public forum. See

ante, at 765. In my judg-ment, neither precedent nor respect for the values protected

by the Establishment Clause justifies that conclusion.The Establishment Clause, "at the very least, prohibits
government from appearing to take a position on questionsof religious belief or from `making adherence to a religion
relevant in any way to a person's standing in the politicalcommunity.' "

County of Allegheny v. American Civil Lib-erties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U. S. 573,

593-594 (1989), quoting Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U. S. 668, 687(1984) (

O'Connor, J., concurring). At least when religioussymbols are involved, the question whether the State is "appearing to take a position" is best judged from the stand-point of a "reasonable observer."

4 It is especially important

to take account of the perspective of a reasonable observerwho may not share the particular religious belief it expresses. A paramount purpose of the Establishment Clauseis to protect such a person from being made to feel like an
outsider in matters of faith, and a stranger in the politicalcommunity.

Ibid. If a reasonable person could perceive agovernment endorsement of religion from a private display,

then the State may not allow its property to be used as aforum for that display. No less stringent rule can ade4 In Allegheny, five Justices found the likely reaction of a " `reasonable
observer' " relevant for purposes of determining whether an endorsement

quately protect nonadherents from a well-grounded percep-tion that their sovereign supports a faith to which they do

not subscribe.5In determining whether the State's maintenance of the
Klan's cross in front of the statehouse conveyed a forbiddenmessage of endorsement, we should be mindful of the power
of a symbol standing alone and unexplained. Even on pri-vate property, signs and symbols are generally understood
to express the owner's views. The location of the sign is asignificant component of the message it conveys.

"Displaying a sign from one's own residence often car-ries a message quite distinct from placing the same sign
someplace else, or conveying the same text or pictureby other means. Precisely because of their location,
such signs provide information about the identity of the`speaker.' As an early and eminent student of rhetoric
observed, the identity of the speaker is an importantcomponent of many attempts to persuade. A sign advo5 Justice O'Connor agrees that an "endorsement test" is appropriate
and that we should judge endorsement from the standpoint of a reasonable
observer. Ante, at 779. But her reasonable observer is a legal fiction,
" `a personification of a community ideal of reasonable behavior, determined by the [collective] social judgment.' " Ante, at 780. The ideal
human Justice O'Connor describes knows and understands much more
than meets the eye. Her "reasonable person" comes off as a well-schooled
jurist, a being finer than the tort-law model. With respect, I think this
enhanced tort-law standard is singularly out of place in the Establishment
Clause context. It strips of constitutional protection every reasonable
person whose knowledge happens to fall below some " `ideal' " standard.
Instead of protecting only the " `ideal' " observer, then, I would extend
protection to the universe of reasonable persons and ask whether some
viewers of the religious display would be likely to perceive a government
endorsement.

Justice O'Connor's argument that "[t]here is always someone" who
will feel excluded by any particular governmental action, ibid., ignores
the requirement that such an apprehension be objectively reasonable. A
person who views an exotic cow at the zoo as a symbol of the government's
approval of the Hindu religion cannot survive this test.

cating `Peace in the Gulf ' in the front lawn of a retiredgeneral or decorated war veteran may provoke a different reaction than the same sign in a 10-year-old child'sbedroom window or the same message on a bumper
sticker of a passing automobile. An espousal of social-ism may carry different implications when displayed on
the grounds of a stately mansion than when pasted on afactory wall or an ambulatory sandwich board."

Cityof Ladue v. Gilleo, 512 U. S. 43, 56-57 (1994) (footnote

omitted).
Like other speakers, a person who places a sign on her ownproperty has the autonomy to choose the content of her own

message. Cf. McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm'n, 514 U. S.334, 341-342 (1995). Thus, the location of a stationary, unattended sign generally is both a component of its message andan implicit endorsement of that message by the party with
the power to decide whether it may be conveyed from thatlocation.

6

So it is with signs and symbols left to speak for themselveson public property. The very fact that a sign is installed on

public property implies official recognition and reinforce-ment of its message. That implication is especially strong
when the sign stands in front of the seat of the governmentitself. The "reasonable observer" of any symbol placed
unattended in front of any capitol in the world will nor-mally assume that the sovereign--which is not only the
owner of that parcel of real estate but also the lawgiver for

6 I recognize there may be exceptions to this general rule. A commercial message displayed on a billboard, for example, usually will not be
taken to represent the views of the billboard's owner because every reasonable observer is aware that billboards are rented as advertising space.
On the other hand, the observer may reasonably infer that the owner of
the billboard is not inalterably opposed to the message presented thereon;
for the owner has the right to exclude messages with which he disagrees,
and he might be expected to exercise that right if his disagreement is
sufficiently profound.

the surrounding territory--has sponsored and facilitated itsmessage.

That the State may have granted a variety of groupspermission to engage in uncensored expressive activities in
front of the capitol building does not, in my opinion, qualify
or contradict the normal inference of endorsement that the
reasonable observer would draw from the unattended, freestanding sign or symbol. Indeed, parades and demonstrations at or near the seat of government are often exercises
of the right of the people to petition their government for a
redress of grievances--exercises in which the government is
the recipient of the message rather than the messenger.
Even when a demonstration or parade is not directed against
government policy, but merely has made use of a particularly
visible forum in order to reach as wide an audience as possible, there usually can be no mistake about the identity of the
messengers as persons other than the State. But when a
statue or some other freestanding, silent, unattended, immoveable structure--regardless of its particular message--
appears on the lawn of the capitol building, the reasonable
observer must identify the State either as the messenger,
or, at the very least, as one who has endorsed the message.
Contrast, in this light, the image of the cross standing alone
and unattended, see infra, at 816, and the image the observer would take away were a hooded Klansman holding, or
standing next to, the very same cross.

This Court has never held that a private party has a right
to place an unattended object in a public forum.7 Today the

7 Despite the absence of any holding on this point, Justice O'Connor
assumes that a reasonable observer would not impute the content of an
unattended display to the government because that observer would know
that the State is required to allow all such displays on Capitol Square.
Ante, at 780-781. Justice O'Connor thus presumes a reasonable observer so prescient as to understand legal doctrines that this Court has
not yet adopted.

Court correctly recognizes that a State may impose a ban onall private unattended displays in such a forum, ante, at 761.

This is true despite the fact that our cases have condemneda number of laws that foreclose an entire medium of expression, even in places where free speech is otherwise allowed.8The First Amendment affords protection to a basic liberty:
"the freedom of speech" that an individual may exercisewhen using the public streets and parks.

Hague v. Commit-tee for Industrial Organization, 307 U. S. 496, 515-516

(1939) (opinion of Roberts, J.). The Amendment, however,does not destroy all property rights. In particular, it does
not empower individuals to erect structures of any kind onpublic property. Members of City Council of Los Angeles
v. Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U. S. 789, 814 (1984); 9 see also

8 "Our prior decisions have voiced particular concern with laws that foreclose an entire medium of expression. Thus, we have held invalid ordinances that completely banned the distribution of pamphlets within the
municipality, Lovell v. Griffin, 303 U. S. 444, 451-452 (1938); handbills on
the public streets, Jamison v. Texas, 318 U. S. 413, 416 (1943); the door-todoor distribution of literature, Martin v. Struthers, 319 U. S. 141, 145-149
(1943); Schneider v. State, 308 U. S. 147, 164-165 (1939), and live entertainment, Schad v. Mount Ephraim, 452 U. S. 61, 75-76 (1981). See also
Frisby v. Schultz, 487 U. S. 474, 486 (1988) (picketing focused upon individual residence is `fundamentally different from more generally directed
means of communication that may not be completely banned in residential
areas'). Although prohibitions foreclosing entire media may be completely free of content or viewpoint discrimination, the danger they pose
to the freedom of speech is readily apparent--by eliminating a common
means of speaking, such measures can suppress too much speech." City
of Ladue v. Gilleo, 512 U. S. 43, 55 (1994) (footnote omitted).

9 In Vincent, we stated:

"Appellees' reliance on the public forum doctrine is misplaced. They
fail to demonstrate the existence of a traditional right of access respecting
such items as utility poles for purposes of their communication comparable
to that recognized for public streets and parks, and it is clear that `the

simply because it is owned or controlled by the government.' United

Clark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence, 468 U. S.
288 (1984). Thus, our cases protecting the individual's freedom to engage in communicative conduct on public property
(whether by speaking, parading, handbilling, waving a flag,
or carrying a banner), e. g., Lovell v. City of Griffin, 303 U. S.
444 (1938), or to send messages from her own property by
placing a sign in the window of her home, City of Ladue v.
Gilleo, 512 U. S., at 58-59, do not establish the right to implant a physical structure (whether a campaign poster, a
burning cross, or a statue of Elvis Presley) on public property. I think the latter "right," which creates a far greater
intrusion on government property and interferes with the
government's ability to differentiate its own message from
those of public individuals, does not exist.10

Because structures on government property--and, in
particular, in front of buildings plainly identified with the
State--imply state approval of their message, the government must have considerable leeway, outside of the religious
arena, to choose what kinds of displays it will allow and what
kinds it will not. Although the First Amendment requires
the government to allow leafletting or demonstrating outside
its buildings, the State has greater power to exclude unattended symbols when they convey a type of message with
which the State does not wish to be identified. I think it
obvious, for example, that Ohio could prohibit certain categories of signs or symbols in Capitol Square--erotic exhibits,
commercial advertising, and perhaps campaign posters as

(1981). Rather, the `existence of a right of access to public property and
the standard by which limitations upon such a right must be evaluated
differ depending on the character of the property at issue.' Perry Education Assn. v. Perry Local Educators' Assn., 460 U. S. 37, 44 (1983)." 466
U. S., at 814.

10 At least, it does not exist as a general matter. I recognize there may

be cases of viewpoint discrimination (say, if the State were to allow campaign signs supporting an incumbent governor but not signs supporting
his opponent) in which access cannot be discriminatorily denied.

well--without violating the Free Speech Clause.11 More-over, our "public forum" cases do not foreclose public entities

from enforcing prohibitions against all unattended displaysin public parks, or possibly even limiting the use of such displays to the communication of noncontroversial messages.12Such a limitation would not inhibit any of the traditional
forms of expression that have been given full constitutional
protection in public fora.The State's general power to restrict the types of unattended displays does not alone suffice to decide this case,because Ohio did not profess to be exercising any such authority. Instead, the Capitol Square Review Board denieda permit for the cross because it believed the Establishment
Clause required as much, and we cannot know whether the

11 The plurality incorrectly assumes that a decision to exclude a category
of speech from an inappropriate forum must rest on a judgment about the
value of that speech. See ante, at 766-767. Yet, we have upheld the
exclusion of all political signs from public vehicles, Lehman v. Shaker
Heights, 418 U. S. 298 (1974), though political expression is at the heart
of the protection afforded by the First Amendment. McIntyre v. Ohio
Elections Comm'n, 514 U. S. 334, 346-347 (1995). A view that "private
prayers," ante, at 767, are most appropriate in private settings is neither
novel nor disrespectful to religious speech.

12 Several scholars have commented on the malleability of our public

forum precedents.

"As [an] overview of the cases strongly suggests, whether or not a given
place is deemed a `public forum' is ordinarily less significant than the
nature of the speech restriction--despite the Court's rhetoric. Indeed,
even the rhetoric at times reveals as much.. . . . .

"Beyond confusing the issues, an excessive focus on the public character
of some forums, coupled with inadequate attention to the precise details
of the restrictions on expression, can leave speech inadequately protected
in some cases, while unduly hampering state and local authorities in
others." L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law 992-993 (2d ed. 1988)

Board would have denied the permit on other grounds.App. 91-92, 169. Accordingly, we must evaluate the State's

rationale on its own terms. But in this case, the endorse-ment inquiry under the Establishment Clause follows from
the State's power to exclude unattended private displaysfrom public property. Just as the Constitution recognizes
the State's interest in preventing its property from beingused as a conduit for ideas it does not wish to give the
appearance of ratifying, the Establishment Clause prohibitsgovernment from allowing, and thus endorsing, unattended
displays that take a position on a religious issue. If theState allows such stationary displays in front of its seat of
government, viewers will reasonably assume that it ap-proves of them. As the picture appended to this opinion
demonstrates, infra, at 816, a reasonable observer wouldlikely infer endorsement from the location of the cross
erected by the Klan in this case. Even if the disclaimer atthe foot of the cross (which stated that the cross was placed
there by a private organization) were legible, that inferencewould remain, because a property owner's decision to allow
a third party to place a sign on her property conveysthe same message of endorsement as if she had erected
it herself.13When the message is religious in character, it is a message the State can neither send nor reinforce without violat-ing the Establishment Clause. Accordingly, I would hold
that the Constitution generally forbids the placement of a

13 Indeed, I do not think any disclaimer could dispel the message of
endorsement in this case. Capitol Square's location in downtown Columbus, Ohio, makes it inevitable that countless motorists and pedestrians
would immediately perceive the proximity of the cross to the capitol without necessarily noticing any disclaimer of public sponsorship. The plurality thus correctly abjures inquiry into the possible adequacy or significance of a legend identifying the owner of the cross. See ante, at 769,
n. 4. Justice Souter is of the view that an adequate disclaimer is constitutionally required, ante, at 793-794, but he does not suggest that the
attachment to the Klan's cross in this case was adequate.

symbol of a religious character in, on, or before a seat ofgovernment.

III
The Court correctly acknowledges that the State's duty toavoid a violation of the Establishment Clause can justify a

content-based restriction on speech or expression, even whenthat restriction would otherwise be prohibited by the Free
Speech Clause. Ante, at 761-762; ante, at 783 (opinion of
O'Connor, J.). The plurality asserts, however, that gov-ernment cannot be perceived to be endorsing a religious display when it merely accords that display "the same access toa public forum that all other displays enjoy."

Ante, at 764.I find this argument unpersuasive.

The existence of a "public forum" in itself cannot dispelthe message of endorsement. A contrary argument would
assume an "ultrareasonable observer" who understands thevagaries of this Court's First Amendment jurisprudence. I
think it presumptuous to consider such knowledge a precon-dition of Establishment Clause protection. Many (probably
most) reasonable people do not know the difference betweena "public forum," a "limited public forum," and a "nonpublic
forum." They do know the difference between a state capi-tol and a church. Reasonable people have differing degrees
of knowledge; that does not make them " `obtuse,' " see 30F. 3d 675, 679 (CA6 1994) (quoting Doe v. Small, 964 F. 2d
611, 630 (CA7 1992) (Easterbrook, J., concurring)); nor doesit make them unworthy of constitutional protection. It
merely makes them human. For a religious display to vio-late the Establishment Clause, I think it is enough that some
reasonable observers would attribute a religious message tothe State.

The plurality appears to rely on the history of this particu-lar public forum--specifically, it emphasizes that Ohio has
in the past allowed three other private unattended displays.Even if the State could not reasonably have been understood
to endorse the prior displays, I would not find this argument

convincing, because it assumes that all reasonable viewersknow all about the history of Capitol Square--a highly unlikely supposition.14 But the plurality's argument fails onits own terms, because each of the three previous displays
conveyed the same message of approval and endorsementthat this one does.

Most significant, of course, is the menorah that stood inCapitol Square during Chanukah. The display of that religious symbol should be governed by the same rule as thedisplay of the cross.

15 In my opinion, both displays are

14 Justice O'Connor apparently would not extend Establishment
Clause protection to passersby who are unaware of Capitol Square's history. See ante, at 780-782. Thus, she sees no reason to distinguish an
intimate knowledge of the square's history from the knowledge that a
cross is a religious symbol or that the statehouse is the statehouse. Ante,
at 780-781. But passersby, including schoolchildren, traveling salesmen,
and tourists as much as those who live next to the statehouse, are members of the body politic, and they are equally entitled to be free from
government endorsement of religion.

15 A fragmented Court reached a different conclusion in County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter,
492 U. S. 573 (1989). In that case, a majority of this Court decided that
a cre`che placed by a private group inside a public building violated the
Establishment Clause, id., at 598-602, but that a menorah placed alongside
a Christmas tree and a "sign saluting liberty" outside that same building
did not. Id., at 613-621 (opinion of Blackmun, J.); id., at 632-637 (opinion
of O'Connor, J.); id., at 663-667 (opinion of Kennedy, J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and White and Scalia, JJ.). The two Justices who provided
the decisive votes to distinguish these situations relied on the presence of
the tree and the sign to find that the menorah, in context, was not a religious, but a secular, symbol of liberty. Id., at 613-621 (opinion of Blackmun, J.); id., at 632-637 (opinion of O'Connor, J.). It was apparently in
reliance on the outcome of the Allegheny case that Ohio believed it could
provide a forum for the menorah (which appeared in Capitol Square with

equally objectionable. Moreover, the fact that the State hasplaced its stamp of approval on two different religions instead of one only compounds the constitutional violation.The Establishment Clause does not merely prohibit the
State from favoring one religious sect over others. It also
proscribes state action supporting the establishment of anumber of religions,

16 as well as the official endorsement of

religion in preference to nonreligion. Wallace v. Jaffree,472 U. S., at 52-55. The State's prior approval of the proreligious message conveyed by the menorah is fully consist-ent with its endorsement of one of the messages conveyed by
the cross: "The State of Ohio favors religion over irreligion."This message is incompatible with the principles embodied
by our Establishment Clause.The record identifies two other examples of freestanding
displays that the State previously permitted in Capitol
Square: a "United Way Campaign `thermometer,' " and"craftsmen's booths and displays erected during an Arts Festival." 17 App. to Pet. for Cert. A16. Both of those exam-ples confirm the proposition that a reasonable observer
should infer official approval of the message conveyed by astructure erected in front of the statehouse. Surely the
thermometer suggested that the State was encouraging pas-sersby to contribute to the United Way. It seems equally
clear that the State was endorsing the creativity of artisansand craftsmen by permitting their booths to occupy a part
of the square. Nothing about either of those freestanding
displays contradicts the normal inference that the State has
endorsed whatever message might be conveyed by permitwould find that the State is powerless to place, or allow to be placed,
any religious symbol--including a menorah or a cross--in front of its seat
of government.

16 See Allegheny, 492 U. S., at 647-649 (Stevens, J., dissenting).

17 The booths were attended during the festival itself, but were left

standing overnight during the pendency of the event. App. 159.

ting an unattended symbol to adorn the capitol grounds.18Accordingly, the fact that the menorah, and later the cross,

stood in an area available " `for free discussion of public ques-tions, or for activities of a broad public purpose,' " Ohio Rev.
Code Ann. $ 105.41 (1994), quoted ante, at 757, is fully con-sistent with the conclusion that the State sponsored those
religious symbols. They, like the thermometer and thebooths, were displayed in a context that connotes state
approval.This case is therefore readily distinguishable from
Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U. S. 263 (1981), and Lamb's Chapelv.

Center Moriches Union Free School Dist., 508 U. S. 384(1993). In both of those cases, as we made perfectly clear,

there was no danger of incorrect identification of the speak-ers and no basis for inferring that their messages had been
endorsed by any public entity. As we explained in thelater case:

"Under these circumstances, as in Widmar, there wouldhave been no realistic danger that the community would
think that the District was endorsing religion or anyparticular creed, and any benefit to religion or to the
Church would have been no more than incidental. Asin

primary effect of advancing or inhibiting religion"; indeed,no other effect is even suggested by the record. The primary difference is that in this case we are dealing with a
visual display--a symbol readily associated with a religion,
in a venue readily associated with the State. This clear
image of endorsement was lacking in Widmar and Lamb's
Chapel, in which the issue was access to government facilities. Moreover, there was no question in those cases of anunattended display; private speakers, who could be distinguished from the State, were present. See supra, at 801-802. Endorsement might still be present in an access case
if, for example, the religious group sought the use of the roof
of a public building for an obviously religious ceremony,
where many onlookers might witness that ceremony and
connect it to the State. But no such facts were alleged in
Widmar or Lamb's Chapel. The religious practices in those
cases were simply less obtrusive, and less likely to send a
message of endorsement, than the eye-catching symbolism
at issue in this case.

The battle over the Klan cross underscores the power of
such symbolism. The menorah prompted the Klan to seek
permission to erect an antisemitic symbol, which in turn not
only prompted vandalism but also motivated other sects to
seek permission to place their own symbols in the square.
These facts illustrate the potential for insidious entanglement that flows from state-endorsed proselytizing. There is
no reason to believe that a menorah placed in front of a synagogue would have motivated any reaction from the Klan, or
that a Klan cross placed on a Klansman's front lawn would
have produced the same reaction as one that enjoyed the
apparent imprimatur of the State of Ohio. Nor is there any
reason to believe the placement of the displays in Capitol
Square had any purpose other than to connect the State--
though perhaps against its will--to the religious or antireligious beliefs of those who placed them there. The cause
of the conflict is the State's apparent approval of a religious

Conspicuously absent from the plurality's opinion is anymention of the values served by the Establishment Clause.
It therefore seems appropriate to repeat a portion of a Courtopinion authored by Justice Black who, more than any other
Justice in the Court's history, espoused a literal interpreta-tion of constitutional text:

"A large proportion of the early settlers of thiscountry came here from Europe to escape the bondage
of laws which compelled them to support and attendgovernment-favored churches. The centuries immedi19 As I stated in Allegheny:
"There is always a risk that such symbols will offend nonmembers of
the faith being advertised as well as adherents who consider the particular
advertisement disrespectful. Some devout Christians believe that the
cre`che should be placed only in reverential settings, such as a church or
perhaps a private home; they do not countenance its use as an aid to commercialization of Christ's birthday. In this very suit, members of the Jewish faith firmly opposed the use to which the menorah was put by the
particular sect that sponsored the display at Pittsburgh's City-County
Building. Even though `[p]assersby who disagree with the message conveyed by these displays are free to ignore them, or even to turn their
backs,' displays of this kind inevitably have a greater tendency to emphasize sincere and deeply felt differences among individuals than to achieve
an ecumenical goal. The Establishment Clause does not allow public bodies to foment such disagreement." 492 U. S., at 650-651 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part) (citations omitted), quoting id., at 664
(Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).

In the words of Clarence Darrow:
" `The realm of religion . . . is where knowledge leaves off, and where
faith begins, and it never has needed the arm of the State for support, and
wherever it has received it, it has harmed both the public and the religion
that it would pretend to serve.' " Tr. of Oral Arg. 7, Scopes v. State, 154

persecutions, generated in large part by establishedsects determined to maintain their absolute political and
religious supremacy. With the power of government
supporting them, at various times and places, Catholicshad persecuted Protestants, Protestants had persecuted

Catholics, Protestant sects had persecuted other Protes-tant sects, Catholics of one shade of belief had persecuted Catholics of another shade of belief, and all ofthese had from time to time persecuted Jews. In efforts to force loyalty to whatever religious group happened to be on top and in league with the government
of a particular time and place, men and women had been
fined, cast in jail, cruelly tortured, and killed. Among
the offenses for which these punishments had been
inflicted were such things as speaking disrespectfully
of the views of ministers of government-established
churches, non-attendance at those churches, expressions
of non-belief in their doctrines, and failure to pay taxes
and tithes to support them.

"These practices of the old world were transplanted
to and began to thrive in the soil of the new America.
The very charters granted by the English Crown to the
individuals and companies designated to make the laws
which would control the destinies of the colonials authorized these individuals and companies to erect religious
establishments which all, whether believers or nonbelievers, would be required to support and attend. An
exercise of this authority was accompanied by a repetition of many of the old-world practices and persecutions.

conscience went to jail; Baptists were peculiarly obnoxious to certain dominant Protestant sects; men

only as their own consciences dictated. And all of thesedissenters were compelled to pay tithes and taxes to
support government-sponsored churches whose ministers preached inflammatory sermons designed tostrengthen and consolidate the established faith by

generating a burning hatred against dissenters.. . . . .

"The `establishment of religion' clause of the FirstAmendment means at least this: Neither a state nor the
Federal Government can set up a church. Neither canpass laws which aid one religion, aid all religions, or prefer one religion over another. Neither can force nor influence a person to go to or to remain away from churchagainst his will or force him to profess a belief or disbelief in any religion. . . . Neither a state nor the FederalGovernment can, openly or secretly, participate in the
affairs of any religious organizations or groups and vice
versa. In the words of Jefferson, the clause against establishment of religion by law was intended to erect `a
wall of separation between church and State.' " Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U. S. 1, 8-10, 15, 16
(1947) (footnotes and citation omitted).

In his eloquent dissent in that same case, Justice Jackson
succinctly explained--

"that the effect of the religious freedom Amendment to
our Constitution was to take every form of propagation
of religion out of the realm of things which could directly
or indirectly be made public business . . . . It was intended not only to keep the states' hands out of religion,
but to keep religion's hands off the state, and, above all,
to keep bitter religious controversy out of public life

The wrestling over the Klan cross in Capitol Square is farremoved from the persecution that motivated William Penn

to set sail for America, and the issue resolved in Everson isquite different from the controversy over symbols that gave
rise to this litigation.20 Nevertheless, the views expressedby both the majority and the dissenters in that landmark
case counsel caution before approving the order of a federaljudge commanding a State to authorize the placement of
freestanding religious symbols in front of the seat of its gov-ernment. The Court's decision today is unprecedented. It
entangles two sovereigns in the propagation of religion, andit disserves the principle of tolerance that underlies the prohibition against state action "respecting an establishmentof religion."

district could, as part of a larger program of reimbursing students for
their transportation to and from school, also reimburse students attending
Catholic schools.

emphasize the breadth and richer meaning of this fundamental command.

We confront here, as Justices O'Connor and Souterpoint out, a large Latin cross that stood alone and unattended in close proximity to Ohio's Statehouse. See ante,at 776 (

O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring injudgment); ante, at 792-793 (

Souter, J., concurring in partand concurring in judgment). Near the stationary cross

were the government's flags and the government's statues.No human speaker was present to disassociate the religious
symbol from the State. No other private display was insight. No plainly visible sign informed the public that the
cross belonged to the Klan and that Ohio's government didnot endorse the display's message.

If the aim of the Establishment Clause is genuinely to un-couple government from church, see

Everson v. Board of Ed.of Ewing, 330 U. S. 1, 16 (1947), a State may not permit,

and a court may not order, a display of this character. Cf.Sullivan, Religion and Liberal Democracy, 59 U. Chi. L. Rev.
195, 197-214 (1992) (negative bar against establishment ofreligion implies affirmative establishment of secular public
order). Justice Souter, in the final paragraphs of hisopinion, suggests two arrangements that might have distanced the State from "the principal symbol of Christianityaround the world," see

Neither arrangement is even arguably present in this case.The District Court's order did not mandate a disclaimer.

identify the Klan as sponsor; it failed to state unequivocallythat Ohio did not endorse the display's message; and it was

not shown to be legible from a distance. The relief orderedby the District Court thus violated the Establishment
Clause.Whether a court order allowing display of a cross, but demanding a sturdier disclaimer, could withstand Establish-ment Clause analysis is a question more difficult than the one
this case poses. I would reserve that question for anotherday and case. But I would not let the prospect of what
might have been permissible control today's decision on theconstitutionality of the display the District Court's order in
fact authorized. See ante, at 816 (appendix to dissent of

ROSENBERGER et al. v. RECTOR AND VISITORSOF UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fourth circuit

No. 94-329. Argued March 1, 1995--Decided June 29, 1995
Respondent University of Virginia, a state instrumentality, authorizes

payments from its Student Activities Fund (SAF) to outside contractors
for the printing costs of a variety of publications issued by student
groups called "Contracted Independent Organizations" (CIO's). The
SAF receives its money from mandatory student fees and is designed
to support a broad range of extracurricular student activities related to
the University's educational purpose. CIO's must include in their dealings with third parties and in all written materials a disclaimer stating
that they are independent of the University and that the University is
not responsible for them. The University withheld authorization for
payments to a printer on behalf of petitioners' CIO, Wide Awake Productions (WAP), solely because its student newspaper, Wide Awake: A
Christian Perspective at the University of Virginia, "primarily promotes
or manifests a particular belie[f] in or about a deity or an ultimate reality," as prohibited by the University's SAF Guidelines. Petitioners
filed this suit under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, alleging, inter alia, that the refusal to authorize payment violated their First Amendment right to
freedom of speech. After the District Court granted summary judgment for the University, the Fourth Circuit affirmed, holding that the
University's invocation of viewpoint discrimination to deny third-party
payment violated the Speech Clause, but concluding that the discrimination was justified by the necessity of complying with the Establishment Clause.

Held:

1. The Guideline invoked to deny SAF support, both in its terms and
in its application to these petitioners, is a denial of their right of free
speech. Pp. 828-837.

(a) The Guideline violates the principles governing speech in limited public forums, which apply to the SAF under, e. g., Perry Ed. Assn.
v. Perry Local Educators' Assn., 460 U. S. 37, 46-47. In determining
whether a State is acting within its power to preserve the limits it has
set for such a forum so that the exclusion of a class of speech there is
legitimate, see, e. g., id., at 49, this Court has observed a distinction
between, on the one hand, content discrimination--i. e., discrimination

OF UNIV. OF VA.

against speech because of its subject matter--which may be permissible
if it preserves the limited forum's purposes, and, on the other hand,
viewpoint discrimination--i. e., discrimination because of the speaker's
specific motivating ideology, opinion, or perspective--which is presumed
impermissible when directed against speech otherwise within the forum's limitations, see id., at 46. The most recent and most apposite
case in this area is Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free
School Dist., 508 U. S. 384, 393, in which the Court held that permitting
school property to be used for the presentation of all views on an issue
except those dealing with it from a religious standpoint constitutes prohibited viewpoint discrimination. Here, as in that case, the State's actions are properly interpreted as unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination rather than permissible line-drawing based on content: By the very
terms of the SAF prohibition, the University does not exclude religion
as a subject matter, but selects for disfavored treatment those student
journalistic efforts with religious editorial viewpoints. Pp. 828-832.

(b) The University's attempt to escape the consequences of Lamb's
Chapel by urging that this case involves the provision of funds rather
than access to facilities is unavailing. Although it may regulate the
content of expression when it is the speaker or when it enlists private
entities to convey its own message, Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U. S. 173;
Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U. S. 263, 276, the University may not discriminate based on the viewpoint of private persons whose speech it subsidizes, Regan v. Taxation with Representation of Wash., 461 U. S. 540,
548. Its argument that the scarcity of public money may justify otherwise impermissible viewpoint discrimination among private speakers is
simply wrong. Pp. 832-835.

(c) Vital First Amendment speech principles are at stake here.
The Guideline at issue has a vast potential reach: The term "promotes"
as used there would comprehend any writing advocating a philosophic
position that rests upon a belief (or nonbelief) in a deity or ultimate
reality, while the term "manifests" would bring within the prohibition any writing resting upon a premise presupposing the existence (or
nonexistence) of a deity or ultimate reality. It is difficult to name
renowned thinkers whose writings would be accepted, save perhaps
for articles disclaiming all connection to their ultimate philosophy.
Pp. 835-837.

2. The violation following from the University's denial of SAF support to petitioners is not excused by the necessity of complying with
the Establishment Clause. Pp. 837-846.

(a) The governmental program at issue is neutral toward religion.
Such neutrality is a significant factor in upholding programs in the face
of Establishment Clause attack, and the guarantee of neutrality is not

offended where, as here, the government follows neutral criteria and
evenhanded policies to extend benefits to recipients whose ideologies
and viewpoints, including religious ones, are broad and diverse, Board
of Ed. of Kiryas Joel Village School Dist. v. Grumet, 512 U. S. 687,
704. There is no suggestion that the University created its program to
advance religion or aid a religious cause. The SAF's purpose is to open
a forum for speech and to support various student enterprises, including
the publication of newspapers, in recognition of the diversity and creativity of student life. The SAF Guidelines have a separate classification for, and do not make third-party payments on behalf of, "religious
organizations," and WAP did not seek a subsidy because of its Christian
editorial viewpoint; it sought funding under the Guidelines as a "student
. . . communications . . . grou[p]." Neutrality is also apparent in the
fact that the University has taken pains to disassociate itself from the
private speech involved in this case. The program's neutrality distinguishes the student fees here from a tax levied for the direct support of
a church or group of churches, which would violate the Establishment
Clause. Pp. 837-842.

(b) This case is not controlled by the principle that special Establishment Clause dangers exist where the government makes direct
money payments to sectarian institutions, see, e. g., Roemer v. Board of
Public Works of Md., 426 U. S. 736, 747, since it is undisputed that no
public funds flow directly into WAP's coffers under the program at issue.
A public university does not violate the Establishment Clause when it
grants access to its facilities on a religion-neutral basis to a wide spectrum of student groups, even if some of those groups would use the
facilities for devotional exercises. See e. g., Widmar, 454 U. S., at 269.
This is so even where the upkeep, maintenance, and repair of those
facilities are paid out of a student activities fund to which students are
required to contribute. Id., at 265. There is no difference in logic or
principle, and certainly no difference of constitutional significance, between using such funds to operate a facility to which students have
access, and paying a third-party contractor to operate the facility on its
behalf. That is all that is involved here: The University provides printing services to a broad spectrum of student newspapers. Were the contrary view to become law, the University could only avoid a constitutional violation by scrutinizing the content of student speech, lest it
contain too great a religious message. Such censorship would be far
more inconsistent with the Establishment Clause's dictates than would
governmental provision of secular printing services on a religion-blind
basis. Pp. 842-846.

requirements. App. to Pet. for Cert. 2a. A CIO must fileits constitution with the University; must pledge not to

OF UNIV. OF VA.

Opinion of the Court

A standard agreement signed between each CIO and theUniversity provides that the benefits and opportunities afforded to CIO's "should not be misinterpreted as meaningthat those organizations are part of or controlled by the University, that the University is responsible for the organizations' contracts or other acts or omissions, or that the Uni-versity approves of the organizations' goals or activities."

Id., at 26.All CIO's may exist and operate at the University, but
some are also entitled to apply for funds from the StudentActivities Fund (SAF). Established and governed by University Guidelines, the purpose of the SAF is to support a
broad range of extracurricular student activities that "are
related to the educational purpose of the University." App.
to Pet. for Cert. 61a. The SAF is based on the University's
"recogni[tion] that the availability of a wide range of opportunities" for its students "tends to enhance the University
environment." App. 26. The Guidelines require that it be
administered "in a manner consistent with the educational
purpose of the University as well as with state and federal
law." App. to Pet. for Cert. 61a. The SAF receives its
money from a mandatory fee of $14 per semester assessed to
each full-time student. The Student Council, elected by the
students, has the initial authority to disburse the funds, but
its actions are subject to review by a faculty body chaired
by a designee of the Vice President for Student Affairs.
Cf. id., at 63a-64a.

Some, but not all, CIO's may submit disbursement requests to the SAF. The Guidelines recognize 11 categories
of student groups that may seek payment to third-party contractors because they "are related to the educational purpose
of the University of Virginia." Id., at 61a-62a. One of
these is "student news, information, opinion, entertainment,
or academic communications media groups." Id., at 61a.
The Guidelines also specify, however, that the costs of certain activities of CIO's that are otherwise eligible for funding

825Cite as: 515 U. S. 819 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
will not be reimbursed by the SAF. The student activitiesthat are excluded from SAF support are religious activities,

philanthropic contributions and activities, political activities,activities that would jeopardize the University's tax-exempt
status, those which involve payment of honoraria or similar
fees, or social entertainment or related expenses. Id., at62a-63a. The prohibition on "political activities" is defined

so that it is limited to electioneering and lobbying. TheGuidelines provide that "[t]hese restrictions on funding political activities are not intended to preclude funding of anyotherwise eligible student organization which . . . espouses
particular positions or ideological viewpoints, including those
that may be unpopular or are not generally accepted." Id.,
at 65a-66a. A "religious activity," by contrast, is defined as
any activity that "primarily promotes or manifests a particular belie[f] in or about a deity or an ultimate reality." Id.,
at 66a.

The Guidelines prescribe these criteria for determining
the amounts of third-party disbursements that will be allowed on behalf of each eligible student organization: the size
of the group, its financial self-sufficiency, and the Universitywide benefit of its activities. If an organization seeks SAF
support, it must submit its bills to the Student Council,
which pays the organization's creditors upon determining
that the expenses are appropriate. No direct payments are
made to the student groups. During the 1990-1991 academic year, 343 student groups qualified as CIO's. One
hundred thirty-five of them applied for support from the
SAF, and 118 received funding. Fifteen of the groups
were funded as "student news, information, opinion, entertainment, or academic communications media groups."

Petitioners' organization, Wide Awake Productions (WAP),
qualified as a CIO. Formed by petitioner Ronald Rosenberger and other undergraduates in 1990, WAP was established "[t]o publish a magazine of philosophical and religious
expression," "[t]o facilitate discussion which fosters an at515us3$91L 08-18-98 10:04:58 PAGES OPINPGT

mosphere of sensitivity to and tolerance of Christian viewpoints," and "[t]o provide a unifying focus for Christians
of multicultural backgrounds." App. 67. WAP publishes
Wide Awake: A Christian Perspective at the University of
Virginia. The paper's Christian viewpoint was evident from
the first issue, in which its editors wrote that the journal
"offers a Christian perspective on both personal and community issues, especially those relevant to college students at
the University of Virginia." App. 45. The editors committed the paper to a two-fold mission: "to challenge Christians to live, in word and deed, according to the faith they
proclaim and to encourage students to consider what a personal relationship with Jesus Christ means." Ibid. The
first issue had articles about racism, crisis pregnancy, stress,
prayer, C. S. Lewis' ideas about evil and free will, and reviews of religious music. In the next two issues, Wide
Awake featured stories about homosexuality, Christian missionary work, and eating disorders, as well as music reviews
and interviews with University professors. Each page of
Wide Awake, and the end of each article or review, is marked
by a cross. The advertisements carried in Wide Awake also
reveal the Christian perspective of the journal. For the
most part, the advertisers are churches, centers for Christian study, or Christian bookstores. By June 1992, WAP had
distributed about 5,000 copies of Wide Awake to University
students, free of charge.

WAP had acquired CIO status soon after it was organized.
This is an important consideration in this case, for had it
been a "religious organization," WAP would not have been
accorded CIO status. As defined by the Guidelines, a "[r]eligious [o]rganization" is "an organization whose purpose is to
practice a devotion to an acknowledged ultimate reality or
deity." App. to Pet. for Cert. 66a. At no stage in this controversy has the University contended that WAP is such an
organization.

827Cite as: 515 U. S. 819 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
A few months after being given CIO status, WAP requested the SAF to pay its printer $5,862 for the costs of
printing its newspaper. The Appropriations Committee of
the Student Council denied WAP's request on the ground
that Wide Awake was a "religious activity" within the meaning of the Guidelines, i. e., that the newspaper "promote[d]
or manifest[ed] a particular belie[f] in or about a deity or
an ultimate reality." Ibid. It made its determination after
examining the first issue. App. 54. WAP appealed the denial to the full Student Council, contending that WAP met
all the applicable Guidelines and that denial of SAF support
on the basis of the magazine's religious perspective violated
the Constitution. The appeal was denied without further
comment, and WAP appealed to the next level, the Student
Activities Committee. In a letter signed by the Dean of
Students, the committee sustained the denial of funding.
App. 55.

Having no further recourse within the University structure, WAP, Wide Awake, and three of its editors and members filed suit in the United States District Court for the
Western District of Virginia, challenging the SAF's action as
violative of Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983. They alleged that refusal to authorize payment of the printing costs
of the publication, solely on the basis of its religious editorial
viewpoint, violated their rights to freedom of speech and
press, to the free exercise of religion, and to equal protection
of the law. They relied also upon Article I of the Virginia
Constitution and the Virginia Act for Religious Freedom, Va.
Code Ann. $$ 57-1, 57-2 (1986 and Supp. 1994), but did not
pursue those theories on appeal. The suit sought damages
for the costs of printing the paper, injunctive and declaratory
relief, and attorney's fees.

On cross-motions for summary judgment, the District
Court ruled for the University, holding that denial of SAF
support was not an impermissible content or viewpoint dis515us3$91L 08-18-98 10:04:58 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court

crimination against petitioners' speech, and that the Univer-sity's Establishment Clause concern over its "religious activities" was a sufficient justification for denying payment tothird-party contractors. The court did not issue a definitive
ruling on whether reimbursement, had it been made here,would or would not have violated the Establishment Clause.
795 F. Supp. 175, 181-182 (WD Va. 1992).The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit,
in disagreement with the District Court, held that the Guide-lines did discriminate on the basis of content. It ruled that,
while the State need not underwrite speech, there was a pre-sumptive violation of the Speech Clause when viewpoint discrimination was invoked to deny third-party payment other-wise available to CIO's. 18 F. 3d 269, 279-281 (1994). The
Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the DistrictCourt nonetheless, concluding that the discrimination by the
University was justified by the "compelling interest in main-taining strict separation of church and state." Id., at 281.
We granted certiorari. 513 U. S. 959 (1994).

II
It is axiomatic that the government may not regulatespeech based on its substantive content or the message it

conveys. Police Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U. S. 92, 96(1972). Other principles follow from this precept. In the
realm of private speech or expression, government regula-tion may not favor one speaker over another. Members of
City Council of Los Angeles v. Taxpayers for Vincent, 466U. S. 789, 804 (1984). Discrimination against speech because
of its message is presumed to be unconstitutional. See
Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U. S. 622,641-643 (1994). These rules informed our determination

that the government offends the First Amendment when itimposes financial burdens on certain speakers based on the
content of their expression. Simon & Schuster, Inc. v.Members of N. Y. State Crime Victims Bd., 502 U. S. 105,

Opinion of the Court
115 (1991). When the government targets not subject mat-ter, but particular views taken by speakers on a subject, the

violation of the First Amendment is all the more blatant.See

R. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505 U. S. 377, 391 (1992). Viewpoint
discrimination is thus an egregious form of content discrimination. The government must abstain from regulatingspeech when the specific motivating ideology or the opinion

or perspective of the speaker is the rationale for the restric-tion. See

Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators' Assn.,
460 U. S. 37, 46 (1983).These principles provide the framework forbidding the

State to exercise viewpoint discrimination, even when the
limited public forum is one of its own creation. In a case
involving a school district's provision of school facilities for
private uses, we declared that "[t]here is no question that
the District, like the private owner of property, may legally
preserve the property under its control for the use to which
it is dedicated." Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union
Free School Dist., 508 U. S. 384, 390 (1993). The necessities
of confining a forum to the limited and legitimate purposes
for which it was created may justify the State in reserving
it for certain groups or for the discussion of certain topics.
See, e. g., Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense & Ed. Fund,
Inc., 473 U. S. 788, 806 (1985); Perry Ed. Assn., supra, at 49.
Once it has opened a limited forum, however, the State must
respect the lawful boundaries it has itself set. The State
may not exclude speech where its distinction is not "reasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum," Cornelius,
supra, at 804-806; see also Perry Ed. Assn., supra, at 46, 49,
nor may it discriminate against speech on the basis of its
viewpoint, Lamb's Chapel, supra, at 392-393; see also Perry
Ed. Assn., supra, at 46; R. A. V., supra, at 386-388, 391-393;
cf. Texas v. Johnson, 491 U. S. 397, 414-415 (1989). Thus, in
determining whether the State is acting to preserve the limits of the forum it has created so that the exclusion of a class
of speech is legitimate, we have observed a distinction be515us3$91L 08-18-98 10:04:58 PAGES OPINPGT

OF UNIV. OF VA.

Opinion of the Court

tween, on the one hand, content discrimination, which maybe permissible if it preserves the purposes of that limited

forum, and, on the other hand, viewpoint discrimination,which is presumed impermissible when directed against
speech otherwise within the forum's limitations. See Perry
Ed. Assn., supra, at 46.The SAF is a forum more in a metaphysical than in a spatial or geographic sense, but the same principles are applica-ble. See,

e. g., Perry Ed. Assn., supra, at 46-47 (forum analysis of a school mail system); Cornelius, supra, at 801 (forumanalysis of charitable contribution program). The most recent and most apposite case is our decision in Lamb's Chapel,
supra. There, a school district had opened school facilities
for use after school hours by community groups for a wide
variety of social, civic, and recreational purposes. The district, however, had enacted a formal policy against opening
facilities to groups for religious purposes. Invoking its policy, the district rejected a request from a group desiring to
show a film series addressing various child-rearing questions
from a "Christian perspective." There was no indication in
the record in Lamb's Chapel that the request to use the
school facilities was "denied, for any reason other than the
fact that the presentation would have been from a religious
perspective." 508 U. S., at 393-394. Our conclusion was
unanimous: "[I]t discriminates on the basis of viewpoint to
permit school property to be used for the presentation of
all views about family issues and child rearing except those
dealing with the subject matter from a religious standpoint."
Id., at 393.

The University does acknowledge (as it must in light of our
precedents) that "ideologically driven attempts to suppress a
particular point of view are presumptively unconstitutional
in funding, as in other contexts," but insists that this case
does not present that issue because the Guidelines draw lines
based on content, not viewpoint. Brief for Respondents 17,
n. 10. As we have noted, discrimination against one set of

515us3$91L 08-18-98 10:04:58 PAGES OPINPGT

831Cite as: 515 U. S. 819 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
views or ideas is but a subset or particular instance of themore general phenomenon of content discrimination. See,

e. g., R. A. V., supra, at 391. And, it must be acknowledged,the distinction is not a precise one. It is, in a sense, something of an understatement to speak of religious thought and
discussion as just a viewpoint, as distinct from a comprehen-sive body of thought. The nature of our origins and destiny

and their dependence upon the existence of a divine beinghave been subjects of philosophic inquiry throughout human
history. We conclude, nonetheless, that here, as in Lamb's
Chapel, viewpoint discrimination is the proper way to interpret the University's objections to Wide Awake. By the
very terms of the SAF prohibition, the University does not
exclude religion as a subject matter but selects for disfavored treatment those student journalistic efforts with religious editorial viewpoints. Religion may be a vast area of
inquiry, but it also provides, as it did here, a specific premise,
a perspective, a standpoint from which a variety of subjects
may be discussed and considered. The prohibited perspective, not the general subject matter, resulted in the refusal to
make third-party payments, for the subjects discussed were
otherwise within the approved category of publications.

The dissent's assertion that no viewpoint discrimination
occurs because the Guidelines discriminate against an entire
class of viewpoints reflects an insupportable assumption that
all debate is bipolar and that antireligious speech is the only
response to religious speech. Our understanding of the
complex and multifaceted nature of public discourse has not
embraced such a contrived description of the marketplace of
ideas. If the topic of debate is, for example, racism, then
exclusion of several views on that problem is just as offensive
to the First Amendment as exclusion of only one. It is as
objectionable to exclude both a theistic and an atheistic perspective on the debate as it is to exclude one, the other, or
yet another political, economic, or social viewpoint. The dissent's declaration that debate is not skewed so long as multi515us3$91L 08-18-98 10:04:58 PAGES OPINPGT
832 ROSENBERGER v. RECTOR AND VISITORS

OF UNIV. OF VA.

Opinion of the Court

ple voices are silenced is simply wrong; the debate is skewedin multiple ways.

The University's denial of WAP's request for third-partypayments in the present case is based upon viewpoint discrimination not unlike the discrimination the school district
relied upon in Lamb's Chapel and that we found invalid.The church group in

Lamb's Chapel would have been qualified as a social or civic organization, save for its religiouspurposes. Furthermore, just as the school district in

Lamb's Chapel pointed to nothing but the religious views ofthe group as the rationale for excluding its message, so in
this case the University justifies its denial of SAF participation to WAP on the ground that the contents of Wide Awake
reveal an avowed religious perspective. See supra, at 827.
It bears only passing mention that the dissent's attempt to
distinguish Lamb's Chapel is entirely without support in the
law. Relying on the transcript of oral argument, the dissent
seems to argue that we found viewpoint discrimination in
that case because the government excluded Christian, but
not atheistic, viewpoints from being expressed in the forum
there. Post, at 897-898, and n. 13. The Court relied on no
such distinction in holding that discriminating against religious speech was discriminating on the basis of viewpoint.
There is no indication in the opinion of the Court (which,
unlike an advocate's statements at oral argument, is the law)
that exclusion or inclusion of other religious or antireligious
voices from that forum had any bearing on its decision.

The University tries to escape the consequences of our
holding in Lamb's Chapel by urging that this case involves
the provision of funds rather than access to facilities. The
University begins with the unremarkable proposition that
the State must have substantial discretion in determining
how to allocate scarce resources to accomplish its educational
mission. Citing our decisions in Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U. S.
173 (1991), Regan v. Taxation with Representation of Wash.,
461 U. S. 540 (1983), and Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U. S. 263

833Cite as: 515 U. S. 819 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
(1981), the University argues that content-based funding de-cisions are both inevitable and lawful. Were the reasoning

of Lamb's Chapel to apply to funding decisions as well as tothose involving access to facilities, it is urged, its holding
"would become a judicial juggernaut, constitutionalizing the
ubiquitous content-based decisions that schools, colleges, andother government entities routinely make in the allocation

of public funds." Brief for Respondents 16.To this end the University relies on our assurance in
Widmar v. Vincent, supra. There, in the course of strikingdown a public university's exclusion of religious groups from
use of school facilities made available to all other student
groups, we stated: "Nor do we question the right of the
University to make academic judgments as to how best to
allocate scarce resources." 454 U. S., at 276. The quoted
language in Widmar was but a proper recognition of the
principle that when the State is the speaker, it may make
content-based choices. When the University determines the
content of the education it provides, it is the University
speaking, and we have permitted the government to regulate
the content of what is or is not expressed when it is the
speaker or when it enlists private entities to convey its own
message. In the same vein, in Rust v. Sullivan, supra, we
upheld the government's prohibition on abortion-related advice applicable to recipients of federal funds for family planning counseling. There, the government did not create a
program to encourage private speech but instead used private speakers to transmit specific information pertaining to
its own program. We recognized that when the government
appropriates public funds to promote a particular policy of
its own it is entitled to say what it wishes. 500 U. S., at 194.
When the government disburses public funds to private
entities to convey a governmental message, it may take
legitimate and appropriate steps to ensure that its message
is neither garbled nor distorted by the grantee. See id.,
at 196-200.

515us3$91L 08-18-98 10:04:58 PAGES OPINPGT
834 ROSENBERGER v. RECTOR AND VISITORS

OF UNIV. OF VA.

Opinion of the Court

It does not follow, however, and we did not suggest in
Widmar, that viewpoint-based restrictions are proper when
the University does not itself speak or subsidize transmittalof a message it favors but instead expends funds to encourage a diversity of views from private speakers. A holding
that the University may not discriminate based on the view-point of private persons whose speech it facilitates does not

restrict the University's own speech, which is controlled bydifferent principles. See,

e. g., Board of Ed. of Westside
Community Schools (Dist. 66) v. Mergens, 496 U. S. 226, 250(1990);

Hazelwood School Dist. v. Kuhlmeier, 484 U. S. 260,
270-272 (1988). For that reason, the University's reliance
on Regan v. Taxation with Representation of Wash., supra,
is inapposite as well. Regan involved a challenge to Congress' choice to grant tax deductions for contributions made
to veterans' groups engaged in lobbying, while denying that
favorable status to other charities which pursued lobbying
efforts. Although acknowledging that the Government is
not required to subsidize the exercise of fundamental rights,
see 461 U. S., at 545-546, we reaffirmed the requirement of
viewpoint neutrality in the Government's provision of financial benefits by observing that "[t]he case would be different
if Congress were to discriminate invidiously in its subsidies
in such a way as to `ai[m] at the suppression of dangerous
ideas,' " see id., at 548 (quoting Cammarano v. United States,
358 U. S. 498, 513 (1959), in turn quoting Speiser v. Randall,
357 U. S. 513, 519 (1958)). Regan relied on a distinction
based on preferential treatment of certain speakers--veterans' organizations--and not a distinction based on the content or messages of those groups' speech. 461 U. S., at 548;
cf. Perry Ed. Assn., 460 U. S., at 49. The University's regulation now before us, however, has a speech-based restriction
as its sole rationale and operative principle.

The distinction between the University's own favored message and the private speech of students is evident in the case
before us. The University itself has taken steps to ensure

515us3$91L 08-18-98 10:04:58 PAGES OPINPGT

835Cite as: 515 U. S. 819 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
the distinction in the agreement each CIO must sign. See
supra, at 824. The University declares that the student
groups eligible for SAF support are not the University'sagents, are not subject to its control, and are not its responsibility. Having offered to pay the third-party contractors on
behalf of private speakers who convey their own messages,the University may not silence the expression of selected

viewpoints.The University urges that, from a constitutional standpoint, funding of speech differs from provision of access tofacilities because money is scarce and physical facilities are
not. Beyond the fact that in any given case this proposition
might not be true as an empirical matter, the underlying
premise that the University could discriminate based on
viewpoint if demand for space exceeded its availability is
wrong as well. The government cannot justify viewpoint
discrimination among private speakers on the economic fact
of scarcity. Had the meeting rooms in Lamb's Chapel been
scarce, had the demand been greater than the supply, our
decision would have been no different. It would have been
incumbent on the State, of course, to ration or allocate the
scarce resources on some acceptable neutral principle; but
nothing in our decision indicated that scarcity would give the
State the right to exercise viewpoint discrimination that is
otherwise impermissible.

Vital First Amendment speech principles are at stake
here. The first danger to liberty lies in granting the State
the power to examine publications to determine whether or
not they are based on some ultimate idea and, if so, for the
State to classify them. The second, and corollary, danger is
to speech from the chilling of individual thought and expression. That danger is especially real in the University setting, where the State acts against a background and tradition
of thought and experiment that is at the center of our intellectual and philosophic tradition. See Healy v. James, 408
U. S. 169, 180-181 (1972); Keyishian v. Board of Regents of

Opinion of the Court

Univ. of State of N. Y., 385 U. S. 589, 603 (1967); Sweezy v.
New Hampshire, 354 U. S. 234, 250 (1957). In ancient Athens, and, as Europe entered into a new period of intellectualawakening, in places like Bologna, Oxford, and Paris, universities began as voluntary and spontaneous assemblages or
concourses for students to speak and to write and to learn.See generally R. Palmer & J. Colton, A History of the Modern World 39 (7th ed. 1992). The quality and creative powerof student intellectual life to this day remains a vital measure of a school's influence and attainment. For the Univer-sity, by regulation, to cast disapproval on particular viewpoints of its students risks the suppression of free speech and
creative inquiry in one of the vital centers for the Nation's
intellectual life, its college and university campuses.

The Guideline invoked by the University to deny thirdparty contractor payments on behalf of WAP effects a
sweeping restriction on student thought and student inquiry
in the context of University sponsored publications. The
prohibition on funding on behalf of publications that "primarily promot[e] or manifes[t] a particular belie[f] in or about a
deity or an ultimate reality," in its ordinary and commonsense meaning, has a vast potential reach. The term "promotes" as used here would comprehend any writing advocating a philosophic position that rests upon a belief in a deity
or ultimate reality. See Webster's Third New International
Dictionary 1815 (1961) (defining "promote" as "to contribute
to the growth, enlargement, or prosperity of: further, encourage"). And the term "manifests" would bring within
the scope of the prohibition any writing that is explicable as
resting upon a premise that presupposes the existence of a
deity or ultimate reality. See id., at 1375 (defining "manifest" as "to show plainly: make palpably evident or certain
by showing or displaying"). Were the prohibition applied
with much vigor at all, it would bar funding of essays by
hypothetical student contributors named Plato, Spinoza, and
Descartes. And if the regulation covers, as the University

Opinion of the Court
says it does, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 18-19, those student jour-nalistic efforts that primarily manifest or promote a belief

that there is no deity and no ultimate reality, then under-graduates named Karl Marx, Bertrand Russell, and JeanPaul Sartre would likewise have some of their major essaysexcluded from student publications. If any manifestation of
beliefs in first principles disqualifies the writing, as seems tobe the case, it is indeed difficult to name renowned thinkers
whose writings would be accepted, save perhaps for articlesdisclaiming all connection to their ultimate philosophy.
Plato could contrive perhaps to submit an acceptable essayon making pasta or peanut butter cookies, provided he did
not point out their (necessary) imperfections.Based on the principles we have discussed, we hold that
the regulation invoked to deny SAF support, both in itsterms and in its application to these petitioners, is a denial
of their right of free speech guaranteed by the First Amend-ment. It remains to be considered whether the violation following from the University's action is excused by the neces-sity of complying with the Constitution's prohibition against
state establishment of religion. We turn to that question.

III
Before its brief on the merits in this Court, the Universityhad argued at all stages of the litigation that inclusion of

WAP's contractors in SAF funding authorization would vio-late the Establishment Clause. Indeed, that is the ground
on which the University prevailed in the Court of Appeals.We granted certiorari on this question: "Whether the Establishment Clause compels a state university to exclude an oth-erwise eligible student publication from participation in the
student activities fund, solely on the basis of its religiousviewpoint, where such exclusion would violate the Speech
and Press Clauses if the viewpoint of the publication werenonreligious." Pet. for Cert. i. The University now seems
to have abandoned this position, contending that "[t]he fun515us3$91L 08-18-98 10:04:58 PAGES OPINPGT

the ability of public education at all levels to control the useof public funds." Brief for Respondents 29; see

and n. 17; Tr. of Oral Arg. 14. That the University itself
no longer presses the Establishment Clause claim is someindication that it lacks force; but as the Court of Appeals

rested its judgment on the point and our dissenting col-leagues would find it determinative, it must be addressed.

The Court of Appeals ruled that withholding SAF supportfrom Wide Awake contravened the Speech Clause of the
First Amendment, but proceeded to hold that the University's action was justified by the necessity of avoiding a violation of the Establishment Clause, an interest it found compelling. 18 F. 3d, at 281. Recognizing that this Court has
regularly "sanctioned awards of direct nonmonetary benefits
to religious groups where government has created open fora
to which all similarly situated organizations are invited,"
id., at 286 (citing Widmar, 454 U. S., at 277), the Fourth
Circuit asserted that direct monetary subsidization of religious organizations and projects is "a beast of an entirely
different color," 18 F. 3d, at 286. The court declared that
the Establishment Clause would not permit the use of public
funds to support " `a specifically religious activity in an otherwise substantially secular setting.' " Id., at 285 (quoting
Hunt v. McNair, 413 U. S. 734, 743 (1973) (emphasis deleted)). It reasoned that because Wide Awake is "a journal
pervasively devoted to the discussion and advancement of an
avowedly Christian theological and personal philosophy," the
University's provision of SAF funds for its publication would
"send an unmistakably clear signal that the University of
Virginia supports Christian values and wishes to promote
the wide promulgation of such values." 18 F. 3d, at 286.

If there is to be assurance that the Establishment Clause
retains its force in guarding against those governmental actions it was intended to prohibit, we must in each case in515us3$91L 08-18-98 10:04:58 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
quire first into the purpose and object of the governmentalaction in question and then into the practical details of the

program's operation. Before turning to these matters, how-ever, we can set forth certain general principles that must
bear upon our determination.

A central lesson of our decisions is that a significant factorin upholding governmental programs in the face of Establishment Clause attack is their neutrality towards religion.We have decided a series of cases addressing the receipt of
government benefits where religion or religious views areimplicated in some degree. The first case in our modern
Establishment Clause jurisprudence was Everson v. Board
of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U. S. 1 (1947). There we cautioned that
in enforcing the prohibition against laws respecting establishment of religion, we must "be sure that we do not inadvertently prohibit [the government] from extending its general state law benefits to all its citizens without regard to
their religious belief." Id., at 16. We have held that the
guarantee of neutrality is respected, not offended, when the
government, following neutral criteria and evenhanded policies, extends benefits to recipients whose ideologies and
viewpoints, including religious ones, are broad and diverse.
See Board of Ed. of Kiryas Joel Village School Dist. v.
Grumet, 512 U. S. 687, 704 (1994) (Souter, J.) ("[T]he principle is well grounded in our case law [and] we have frequently
relied explicitly on the general availability of any benefit provided religious groups or individuals in turning aside Establishment Clause challenges"); Witters v. Washington Dept.
of Servs. for Blind, 474 U. S. 481, 487-488 (1986); Mueller v.
Allen, 463 U. S. 388, 398-399 (1983); Widmar, supra, at 274-
275. More than once have we rejected the position that the
Establishment Clause even justifies, much less requires, a
refusal to extend free speech rights to religious speakers
who participate in broad-reaching government programs
neutral in design. See Lamb's Chapel, 508 U. S., at 393-394;

840 ROSENBERGER v. RECTOR AND VISITORS

OF UNIV. OF VA.

Opinion of the Court

The governmental program here is neutral toward reli-gion. There is no suggestion that the University created it

to advance religion or adopted some ingenious device withthe purpose of aiding a religious cause. The object of the
SAF is to open a forum for speech and to support various
student enterprises, including the publication of newspapers,in recognition of the diversity and creativity of student life.

The University's SAF Guidelines have a separate classifica-tion for, and do not make third-party payments on behalf of,
"religious organizations," which are those "whose purpose isto practice a devotion to an acknowledged ultimate reality
or deity." Pet. for Cert. 66a. The category of support here
is for "student news, information, opinion, entertainment, or
academic communications media groups," of which Wide
Awake was 1 of 15 in the 1990 school year. WAP did not
seek a subsidy because of its Christian editorial viewpoint;
it sought funding as a student journal, which it was.

The neutrality of the program distinguishes the student
fees from a tax levied for the direct support of a church or
group of churches. A tax of that sort, of course, would run
contrary to Establishment Clause concerns dating from the
earliest days of the Republic. The apprehensions of our
predecessors involved the levying of taxes upon the public
for the sole and exclusive purpose of establishing and supporting specific sects. The exaction here, by contrast, is a
student activity fee designed to reflect the reality that student life in its many dimensions includes the necessity of
wide-ranging speech and inquiry and that student expression
is an integral part of the University's educational mission.
The fee is mandatory, and we do not have before us the question whether an objecting student has the First Amendment
right to demand a pro rata return to the extent the fee is
expended for speech to which he or she does not subscribe.
See Keller v. State Bar of Cal., 496 U. S. 1, 15-16 (1990);
Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Ed., 431 U. S. 209, 235-236 (1977).
We must treat it, then, as an exaction upon the students.

841Cite as: 515 U. S. 819 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
But the $14 paid each semester by the students is not a gen-eral tax designed to raise revenue for the University. See

United States v. Butler, 297 U. S. 1, 61 (1936) ("A tax, inthe general understanding of the term, and as used in the
Constitution, signifies an exaction for the support of the Government"); see also Head Money Cases, 112 U. S. 580, 595-596 (1884). The SAF cannot be used for unlimited purposes,

much less the illegitimate purpose of supporting one religion.Much like the arrangement in

Widmar, the money goes to a
special fund from which any group of students with CIO sta-tus can draw for purposes consistent with the University's

educational mission; and to the extent the student is interested in speech, withdrawal is permitted to cover the whole
spectrum of speech, whether it manifests a religious view, an
antireligious view, or neither. Our decision, then, cannot be
read as addressing an expenditure from a general tax fund.
Here, the disbursements from the fund go to private contractors for the cost of printing that which is protected under
the Speech Clause of the First Amendment. This is a far
cry from a general public assessment designed and effected
to provide financial support for a church.

Government neutrality is apparent in the State's overall
scheme in a further meaningful respect. The program respects the critical difference "between government speech
endorsing religion, which the Establishment Clause forbids,
and private speech endorsing religion, which the Free
Speech and Free Exercise Clauses protect." Mergens,
supra, at 250 (opinion of O'Connor, J.). In this case, "the
government has not fostered or encouraged" any mistaken
impression that the student newspapers speak for the University. Capitol Square Review and Advisory Bd. v. Pinette, ante, at 766. The University has taken pains to disassociate itself from the private speech involved in this case.
The Court of Appeals' apparent concern that Wide Awake's
religious orientation would be attributed to the University
is not a plausible fear, and there is no real likelihood that the

Opinion of the Court

speech in question is being either endorsed or coerced by theState, see

Lee v. Weisman, 505 U. S. 577, 587 (1992); Witters,
supra, at 489 (citing Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U. S. 668, 688(1984) (

O'Connor, J., concurring)); see also Witters, supra,
at 493 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring
in judgment) (citing Lynch, supra, at 690 (O'Connor, J.,concurring)).

The Court of Appeals (and the dissent) are correct toextract from our decisions the principle that we have recognized special Establishment Clause dangers where thegovernment makes direct money payments to sectarian
institutions, citing Roemer v. Board of Public Works of Md.,
426 U. S. 736, 747 (1976); Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U. S. 589,
614-615 (1988); Hunt v. McNair, 413 U. S., at 742; Tilton v.
Richardson, 403 U. S. 672, 679-680 (1971); Board of Ed. of
Central School Dist. No. 1 v. Allen, 392 U. S. 236 (1968).
The error is not in identifying the principle, but in believing
that it controls this case. Even assuming that WAP is no
different from a church and that its speech is the same as the
religious exercises conducted in Widmar (two points much in
doubt), the Court of Appeals decided a case that was, in essence, not before it, and the dissent would have us do the
same. We do not confront a case where, even under a neutral program that includes nonsectarian recipients, the government is making direct money payments to an institution
or group that is engaged in religious activity. Neither the
Court of Appeals nor the dissent, we believe, takes sufficient
cognizance of the undisputed fact that no public funds flow
directly to WAP's coffers.

It does not violate the Establishment Clause for a public
university to grant access to its facilities on a religionneutral basis to a wide spectrum of student groups, including
groups that use meeting rooms for sectarian activities, accompanied by some devotional exercises. See Widmar, 454
U. S., at 269; Mergens, 496 U. S., at 252. This is so even
where the upkeep, maintenance, and repair of the facilities

515us3$91L 08-18-98 10:04:58 PAGES OPINPGT

843Cite as: 515 U. S. 819 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
attributed to those uses are paid from a student activities
fund to which students are required to contribute. Widmar,
supra, at 265. The government usually acts by spending
money. Even the provision of a meeting room, as in
Mergens and Widmar, involved governmental expenditure,
if only in the form of electricity and heating or cooling costs.
The error made by the Court of Appeals, as well as by the
dissent, lies in focusing on the money that is undoubtedly
expended by the government, rather than on the nature of
the benefit received by the recipient. If the expenditure of
governmental funds is prohibited whenever those funds pay
for a service that is, pursuant to a religion-neutral program,
used by a group for sectarian purposes, then Widmar,
Mergens, and Lamb's Chapel would have to be overruled.
Given our holdings in these cases, it follows that a public
university may maintain its own computer facility and give
student groups access to that facility, including the use of the
printers, on a religion neutral, say first-come-first-served,
basis. If a religious student organization obtained access on
that religion-neutral basis and used a computer to compose
or a printer or copy machine to print speech with a religious
content or viewpoint, the State's action in providing the
group with access would no more violate the Establishment
Clause than would giving those groups access to an assembly
hall. See Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free
School Dist., 508 U. S. 384 (1993); Widmar, supra; Mergens,
supra. There is no difference in logic or principle, and no
difference of constitutional significance, between a school
using its funds to operate a facility to which students have
access, and a school paying a third-party contractor to operate the facility on its behalf. The latter occurs here. The
University provides printing services to a broad spectrum of
student newspapers qualified as CIO's by reason of their officers and membership. Any benefit to religion is incidental
to the government's provision of secular services for secular

OF UNIV. OF VA.

Opinion of the Court

purposes on a religion-neutral basis. Printing is a routine,secular, and recurring attribute of student life.

By paying outside printers, the University in fact attainsa further degree of separation from the student publication,
for it avoids the duties of supervision, escapes the costs of
upkeep, repair, and replacement attributable to student use,and has a clear record of costs. As a result, and as in

Widmar, the University can charge the SAF, and not thetaxpayers as a whole, for the discrete activity in question.
It would be formalistic for us to say that the University mustforfeit these advantages and provide the services itself in
order to comply with the Establishment Clause. It is, of
course, true that if the State pays a church's bills it is subsidizing it, and we must guard against this abuse. That is not
a danger here, based on the considerations we have advanced
and for the additional reason that the student publication is
not a religious institution, at least in the usual sense of that
term as used in our case law, and it is not a religious organization as used in the University's own regulations. It is instead a publication involved in a pure forum for the expression of ideas, ideas that would be both incomplete and chilled
were the Constitution to be interpreted to require that state
officials and courts scan the publication to ferret out views
that principally manifest a belief in a divine being.

Were the dissent's view to become law, it would require
the University, in order to avoid a constitutional violation, to
scrutinize the content of student speech, lest the expression
in question--speech otherwise protected by the Constitution--contain too great a religious content. The dissent, in
fact, anticipates such censorship as "crucial" in distinguishing between "works characterized by the evangelism of Wide
Awake and writing that merely happens to express views
that a given religion might approve." Post, at 896. That
eventuality raises the specter of governmental censorship, to
ensure that all student writings and publications meet some
baseline standard of secular orthodoxy. To impose that

Opinion of the Court
standard on student speech at a university is to imperil thevery sources of free speech and expression. As we recognized in Widmar, official censorship would be far more incon-sistent with the Establishment Clause's dictates than would
governmental provision of secular printing services on areligion-blind basis.

"[T]he dissent fails to establish that the distinction [be-tween `religious' speech and speech `about' religion] has
intelligible content. There is no indication when `sing-ing hymns, reading scripture, and teaching biblical principles' cease to be `singing, teaching, and reading'--allapparently forms of `speech,' despite their religious subject matter--and become unprotected `worship.' . . .
"[E]ven if the distinction drew an arguably principledline, it is highly doubtful that it would lie within the

judicial competence to administer. Merely to draw thedistinction would require the university--and ultimately
the courts--to inquire into the significance of words andpractices to different religious faiths, and in varying circumstances by the same faith. Such inquiries wouldtend inevitably to entangle the State with religion in a
manner forbidden by our cases. E. g., Walz v. Tax
Comm'n of City of New York, 397 U. S. 664 (1970)." 454U. S., at 269-270, n. 6 (citations omitted).

To obey the Establishment Clause, it was not necessaryfor the University to deny eligibility to student publications

because of their viewpoint. The neutrality commanded ofthe State by the separate Clauses of the First Amendment
was compromised by the University's course of action. Theviewpoint discrimination inherent in the University's regulation required public officials to scan and interpret studentpublications to discern their underlying philosophic assumptions respecting religious theory and belief. That course ofaction was a denial of the right of free speech and would risk

fostering a pervasive bias or hostility to religion, which couldundermine the very neutrality the Establishment Clause

requires. There is no Establishment Clause violation inthe University's honoring its duties under the Free Speech
Clause.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals must be, and is,reversed.

It is so ordered.
Justice O'Connor, concurring.
"We have time and again held that the government generally may not treat people differently based on the God orgods they worship, or do not worship."

Board of Ed. of
Kiryas Joel Village School Dist. v. Grumet, 512 U. S. 687,714 (1994) (

O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring
in judgment). This insistence on government neutrality
toward religion explains why we have held that schools may
not discriminate against religious groups by denying them
equal access to facilities that the schools make available to
all. See Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free
School Dist., 508 U. S. 384 (1993); Widmar v. Vincent, 454
U. S. 263 (1981). Withholding access would leave an impermissible perception that religious activities are disfavored:
"[T]he message is one of neutrality rather than endorsement;
if a State refused to let religious groups use facilities open to
others, then it would demonstrate not neutrality but hostility
toward religion." Board of Ed. of Westside Community
Schools (Dist. 66) v. Mergens, 496 U. S. 226, 248 (1990) (plurality opinion). "The Religion Clauses prohibit the government from favoring religion, but they provide no warrant for
discriminating against religion." Kiryas Joel, supra, at 717
(O'Connor, J.). Neutrality, in both form and effect, is one
hallmark of the Establishment Clause.

As Justice Souter demonstrates, however, post, at 868-
872 (dissenting opinion), there exists another axiom in the
history and precedent of the Establishment Clause. "Public

funds may not be used to endorse the religious message."
Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U. S. 589, 642 (1988) (Blackmun, J.,
dissenting); see also id., at 622 (O'Connor, J., concurring).Our cases have permitted some government funding of secular functions performed by sectarian organizations. See,
e. g., id., at 617 (funding for sex education); Roemer v. Board
of Public Works of Md., 426 U. S. 736, 741 (1976) (cash grant
to colleges not to be used for "sectarian purposes"); Bradfield v. Roberts, 175 U. S. 291, 299-300 (1899) (funding of
health care for indigent patients). These decisions, how-ever, provide no precedent for the use of public funds to

finance religious activities.

This case lies at the intersection of the principle of government neutrality and the prohibition on state funding of religious activities. It is clear that the University has established a generally applicable program to encourage the free
exchange of ideas by its students, an expressive marketplace
that includes some 15 student publications with predictably
divergent viewpoints. It is equally clear that petitioners'
viewpoint is religious and that publication of Wide Awake is
a religious activity, under both the University's regulation
and a fair reading of our precedents. Not to finance Wide
Awake, according to petitioners, violates the principle of neutrality by sending a message of hostility toward religion.
To finance Wide Awake, argues the University, violates the
prohibition on direct state funding of religious activities.

When two bedrock principles so conflict, understandably
neither can provide the definitive answer. Reliance on categorical platitudes is unavailing. Resolution instead depends
on the hard task of judging--sifting through the details and
determining whether the challenged program offends the
Establishment Clause. Such judgment requires courts to
draw lines, sometimes quite fine, based on the particular
facts of each case. See Lee v. Weisman, 505 U. S. 577, 598
(1992) ("Our jurisprudence in this area is of necessity one of
line-drawing"). As Justice Holmes observed in a different

context: "Neither are we troubled by the question where todraw the line. That is the question in pretty much everything worth arguing in the law. Day and night, youth andage are only types."

Irwin v. Gavit, 268 U. S. 161, 168
(1925) (citation omitted).

In Witters v. Washington Dept. of Servs. for Blind, 474U. S. 481 (1986), for example, we unanimously held that the

State may, through a generally applicable financial aid pro-gram, pay a blind student's tuition at a sectarian theological
institution. The Court so held, however, only after empha-sizing that "vocational assistance provided under the Washington program is paid directly to the student, who transmits
it to the educational institution of his or her choice." Id., at
487. The benefit to religion under the program, therefore,
is akin to a public servant contributing her government paycheck to the church. Ibid. We thus resolved the conflict
between the neutrality principle and the funding prohibition,
not by permitting one to trump the other, but by relying on
the elements of choice peculiar to the facts of that case: "The
aid to religion at issue here is the result of petitioner's private choice. No reasonable observer is likely to draw from
the facts before us an inference that the State itself is endorsing a religious practice or belief." Id., at 493 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).
See also Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dist., 509 U. S.
1, 10-11 (1993).

The need for careful judgment and fine distinctions presents itself even in extreme cases. Everson v. Board of Ed.
of Ewing, 330 U. S. 1 (1947), provided perhaps the strongest
exposition of the no-funding principle: "No tax in any
amount, large or small, can be levied to support any religious
activities or institutions, whatever they may be called, or
whatever form they may adopt to teach or practice religion."
Id., at 16. Yet the Court approved the use of public funds,
in a general program, to reimburse parents for their children's bus fares to attend Catholic schools. Id., at 17-18.

Although some would cynically dismiss the Court's disposition as inconsistent with its protestations, see id., at 19
(Jackson, J., dissenting) ("[T]he most fitting precedent is that
of Julia who, according to Byron's reports, `whispering "I will
ne'er consent,"--consented' "), the decision reflected the need
to rely on careful judgment--not simple categories--when
two principles, of equal historical and jurisprudential pedigree, come into unavoidable conflict.

So it is in this case. The nature of the dispute does not
admit of categorical answers, nor should any be inferred
from the Court's decision today, see ante, at 838-839. Instead, certain considerations specific to the program at issue
lead me to conclude that by providing the same assistance
to Wide Awake that it does to other publications, the University would not be endorsing the magazine's religious
perspective.

First, the student organizations, at the University's insistence, remain strictly independent of the University. The
University's agreement with the Contracted Independent
Organizations (CIO)--i. e., student groups--provides:

"The University is a Virginia public corporation and the
CIO is not part of that corporation, but rather exists and
operates independently of the University. . . .

"The parties understand and agree that this Agreement
is the only source of any control the University may
have over the CIO or its activities . . . ." App. 27.

And the agreement requires that student organizations include in every letter, contract, publication, or other written
materials the following disclaimer:

"Although this organization has members who are University of Virginia students (faculty) (employees), the
organization is independent of the corporation which is
the University and which is not responsible for the organization's contracts, acts or omissions." Id., at 28.

Any reader of Wide Awake would be on notice of the publi-cation's independence from the University. Cf.

Widmar v.
Vincent, 454 U. S., at 274, n. 14.Second, financial assistance is distributed in a manner that

ensures its use only for permissible purposes. A student
organization seeking assistance must submit disbursementrequests; if approved, the funds are paid directly to the

third-party vendor and do not pass through the organiza-tion's coffers. This safeguard accompanying the University's financial assistance, when provided to a publication witha religious viewpoint such as Wide Awake, ensures that the
funds are used only to further the University's purpose in
maintaining a free and robust marketplace of ideas, from
whatever perspective. This feature also makes this case
analogous to a school providing equal access to a generally
available printing press (or other physical facilities), ante, at
843, and unlike a block grant to religious organizations.

Third, assistance is provided to the religious publication
in a context that makes improbable any perception of
government endorsement of the religious message. Wide
Awake does not exist in a vacuum. It competes with 15
other magazines and newspapers for advertising and readership. The widely divergent viewpoints of these many purveyors of opinion, all supported on an equal basis by the
University, significantly diminishes the danger that the message of any one publication is perceived as endorsed by the
University. Besides the general news publications, for example, the University has provided support to The Yellow
Journal, a humor magazine that has targeted Christianity as
a subject of satire, and Al-Salam, a publication to "promote
a better understanding of Islam to the University Community," App. 92. Given this wide array of nonreligious, antireligious and competing religious viewpoints in the forum
supported by the University, any perception that the University endorses one particular viewpoint would be illogical.
This is not the harder case where religious speech threatens

to dominate the forum. Cf. Capitol Square Review and Advisory Bd. v. Pinette, ante, at 777 (O'Connor, J., concurring
in part and concurring in judgment); Mergens, 496 U. S., at275.

Finally, although the question is not presented here, I note
the possibility that the student fee is susceptible to a FreeSpeech Clause challenge by an objecting student that she

should not be compelled to pay for speech with which shedisagrees. See,

e. g., Keller v. State Bar of Cal., 496 U. S. 1,
15 (1990); Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Ed., 431 U. S. 209, 236(1977). There currently exists a split in the lower courts as

to whether such a challenge would be successful. Compare
Hays County Guardian v. Supple, 969 F. 2d 111, 123 (CA5
1992), cert. denied, 506 U. S. 1087 (1993); Kania v. Fordham,
702 F. 2d 475, 480 (CA4 1983); Good v. Associated Students

of Univ. of Wash., 86 Wash. 2d 94, 105-106, 542 P. 2d 762,

4 Cal. 4th 843, 863-864, 844 P. 2d 500, 513-514, cert. denied,
510 U. S. 863 (1993). While the Court does not resolve the
question here, see ante, at 840, the existence of such an optout possibility not available to citizens generally, see Abood,
supra, at 259, n. 13 (Powell, J., concurring in judgment), provides a potential basis for distinguishing proceeds of the student fees in this case from proceeds of the general assessments in support of religion that lie at the core of the
prohibition against religious funding, see ante, at 840-841;
post, at 852-855 (Thomas, J., concurring); post, at 868-872
(Souter, J., dissenting), and from government funds generally. Unlike moneys dispensed from state or federal treasuries, the Student Activities Fund is collected from students
who themselves administer the fund and select qualifying
recipients only from among those who originally paid the fee.
The government neither pays into nor draws from this common pool, and a fee of this sort appears conducive to granting

whether derived from tax revenue, sales of assets, or other-wise, but a fund that simply belongs to the students.

The Court's decision today therefore neither trumpets thesupremacy of the neutrality principle nor signals the demise
of the funding prohibition in Establishment Clause jurisprudence. As I observed last Term, "[e]xperience proves thatthe Establishment Clause, like the Free Speech Clause, cannot easily be reduced to a single test." Kiryas Joel, 512U. S., at 720 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in
judgment). When bedrock principles collide, they test thelimits of categorical obstinacy and expose the flaws and dangers of a Grand Unified Theory that may turn out to be nei-ther grand nor unified. The Court today does only what
courts must do in many Establishment Clause cases--focus
on specific features of a particular government action toensure that it does not violate the Constitution. By withholding from Wide Awake assistance that the Universityprovides generally to all other student publications, the University has discriminated on the basis of the magazine's reli-gious viewpoint in violation of the Free Speech Clause.
And particular features of the University's program--suchas the explicit disclaimer, the disbursement of funds directly
to third-party vendors, the vigorous nature of the forum at
issue, and the possibility for objecting students to opt out--convince me that providing such assistance in this case would

not carry the danger of impermissible use of public funds to
endorse Wide Awake's religious message.

Subject to these comments, I join the opinion of the Court.

Justice Thomas, concurring.
I agree with the Court's opinion and join it in full, but
I write separately to express my disagreement with the
historical analysis put forward by the dissent. Although
the dissent starts down the right path in consulting the original meaning of the Establishment Clause, its misleading
application of history yields a principle that is inconsistent
with our Nation's long tradition of allowing religious adher515us3$91N 08-18-98 10:04:58 PAGES OPINPGT

ents to participate on equal terms in neutral governmentprograms.

Even assuming that the Virginia debate on the so-called"Assessment Controversy" was indicative of the principles
embodied in the Establishment Clause, this incident hardlycompels the dissent's conclusion that government must actively discriminate against religion. The dissent's historicaldiscussion glosses over the fundamental characteristic of the
Virginia assessment bill that sparked the controversy: Theassessment was to be imposed for the support of clergy in
the performance of their function of teaching religion.
Thus, the "Bill Establishing a Provision for Teachers of the
Christian Religion" provided for the collection of a specifictax, the proceeds of which were to be appropriated "by the

Vestries, Elders, or Directors of each religious society . . . toa provision for a Minister or Teacher of the Gospel of their
denomination, or the providing places of divine worship, andto none other use whatsoever." See

Everson v. Board of
Ed. of Ewing, 330 U. S. 1, 74 (1947) (appendix to dissent ofRutledge, J.).

1 The dissent suggests that the assessment bill would have created a
"generally available subsidy program" comparable to respondents' Student
Activities Fund (SAF). See post, at 869, n. 1. The dissent's characterization of the bill, however, is squarely at odds with the bill's clear purpose
and effect to provide "for the support of Christian teachers." Everson,
330 U. S., at 72. Moreover, the section of the bill cited by the dissent, see
post, at 869, n. 1, simply indicated that funds would be "disposed of under
the direction of the General Assembly, for the encouragement of seminaries of learning within the Counties whence such sums shall arise,"
Everson, supra, at 74. This provision disposing of undesignated funds
hardly transformed the "Bill Establishing a Provision for Teachers of the
Christian Religion" into a truly neutral program that would benefit religious adherents as part of a large class of beneficiaries defined without
reference to religion. Indeed, the only appropriation of money made by
the bill would have been to promote "the general diffusion of Christian
knowledge," 330 U. S., at 72; any possible appropriation for "seminaries of
learning" depended entirely on future legislative action.

Even assuming that future legislators would adhere to the bill's directive in appropriating the undesignated tax revenues, nothing in the bill

James Madison's Memorial and Remonstrance Against Re-ligious Assessments (hereinafter Madison's Remonstrance)

must be understood in this context. Contrary to the dis-sent's suggestion, Madison's objection to the assessment bill
did not rest on the premise that religious entities may neverparticipate on equal terms in neutral government programs.
Nor did Madison embrace the argument that forms the linch-pin of the dissent: that monetary subsidies are constitutionally different from other neutral benefits programs.Instead, Madison's comments are more consistent with the
neutrality principle that the dissent inexplicably discards.According to Madison, the Virginia assessment was flawed
because it "violate[d] that equality which ought to be thebasis of every law." Madison's Remonstrance || 4, reprinted
in Everson, supra, at 66 (appendix to dissent of Rutledge,J.). The assessment violated the "equality" principle not bewould prevent use of those funds solely for sectarian educational institutions. To the contrary, most schools at the time of the founding were
affiliated with some religious organization, see C. Antieau, A. Downey, &
E. Roberts, Freedom From Federal Establishment, Formation and Early
History of the First Amendment Religion Clauses 163 (1964), and in fact
there was no system of public education in Virginia until several decades
after the assessment bill was proposed, see A. Morrison, The Beginnings
of Public Education in Virginia, 1776-1860, p. 9 (1917); see also A. Johnson,
The Legal Status of Church-State Relationships in the United States 4
(1982) ("In Virginia the parish institutions transported from England were
the earliest educational agencies. Although much of the teaching took
place in the home and with the aid of tutors, every minister had a school,
and it was the duty of the vestry to see that all the poor children were
taught to read and write") (footnote omitted). Further, the clearly religious tenor of the Virginia assessment would seem to point toward appropriation of residual funds to sectarian "seminaries of learning." Finally,
although modern historians have focused on the opt-out provision, the dissent provides no indication that Madison viewed the Virginia assessment
as an evenhanded program; in fact, several of the objections expressed in
Madison's Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments,
reprinted in Everson, supra, at 63, focus clearly on the bill's violation
of the principle of "equality," or evenhandedness. See infra this page
and 855-857.

cause it allowed religious groups to participate in a generallyavailable government program, but because the bill singled

out religious entities for special benefits. See ibid. (arguingthat the assessment violated the equality principle "by subjecting some to peculiar burdens" and "by granting to otherspeculiar exemptions").

Legal commentators have disagreed about the historicallesson to take from the Assessment Controversy. For some,
the experience in Virginia is consistent with the view thatthe Framers saw the Establishment Clause simply as a
prohibition on governmental preferences for some religiousfaiths over others. See R. Cord, Separation of Church and
State: Historical Fact and Current Fiction 20-23 (1982);Smith, Getting Off on the Wrong Foot and Back on Again: A
Reexamination of the History of the Framing of the ReligionClauses of the First Amendment and a Critique of the Reynolds and Everson Decisions, 20 Wake Forest L. Rev. 569,590-591 (1984). Other commentators have rejected this
view, concluding that the Establishment Clause forbids notonly government preferences for some religious sects over
others, but also government preferences for religion overirreligion. See,

e. g., Laycock, "Nonpreferential" Aid toReligion: A False Claim About Original Intent, 27 Wm. &

Mary L. Rev. 875 (1986).I find much to commend the former view. Madison's focus on the preferential nature of the assessment was notrestricted to the fourth paragraph of the Remonstrance
discussed above. The funding provided by the Virginia as-sessment was to be extended only to Christian sects, and
the Remonstrance seized on this defect:

"Who does not see that the same authority which canestablish Christianity, in exclusion of all other Religions,

may establish with the same ease any particular sectof Christians, in exclusion of all other Sects." Madison's Remonstrance || 3, reprinted in Everson, supra,at 65.

In addition to the third and fourth paragraphs of the Remon-strance, "Madison's seventh, ninth, eleventh, and twelfth

arguments all speak, in some way, to the same intolerance,bigotry, unenlightenment, and persecution that had generally
resulted from previous exclusive religious establishments."
Cord, supra, at 21. The conclusion that Madison saw theprinciple of nonestablishment as barring governmental preferences for particular religious faiths seems especially clearin light of statements he made in the more relevant context
of the House debates on the First Amendment. See Wallacev.

Jaffree, 472 U. S. 38, 98 (1985) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting)
(Madison's views "as reflected by actions on the floor of the
House in 1789, [indicate] that he saw the [First] Amendment
as designed to prohibit the establishment of a national religion, and perhaps to prevent discrimination among sects,"
but not "as requiring neutrality on the part of government
between religion and irreligion"). Moreover, even if more
extreme notions of the separation of church and state can
be attributed to Madison, many of them clearly stem from
"arguments reflecting the concepts of natural law, natural
rights, and the social contract between government and a
civil society," Cord, supra, at 22, rather than the principle of
nonestablishment in the Constitution. In any event, the
views of one man do not establish the original understanding
of the First Amendment.

But resolution of this debate is not necessary to decide
this case. Under any understanding of the Assessment Controversy, the history cited by the dissent cannot support the
conclusion that the Establishment Clause "categorically condemn[s] state programs directly aiding religious activity"
when that aid is part of a neutral program available to a
wide array of beneficiaries. Post, at 875. Even if Madison
believed that the principle of nonestablishment of religion
precluded government financial support for religion per se
(in the sense of government benefits specifically targeting
religion), there is no indication that at the time of the fram515us3$91N 08-18-98 10:04:58 PAGES OPINPGT

ing he took the dissent's extreme view that the governmentmust discriminate against religious adherents by excluding

them from more generally available financial subsidies.2In fact, Madison's own early legislative proposals cut
against the dissent's suggestion. In 1776, when Virginia'sRevolutionary Convention was drafting its Declaration of
Rights, Madison prepared an amendment that would havedisestablished the Anglican Church. This amendment
(which went too far for the Convention and was not adopted)is not nearly as sweeping as the dissent's version of disestablishment; Madison merely wanted the Convention to declarethat "no man or class of men ought, on account of religion[,]
to be invested with peculiar emoluments or privileges . . . ."Madison's Amendments to the Declaration of Rights (May
29- June 12, 1776), in 1 Papers of James Madison 174 (W.Hutchinson & W. Rachal eds. 1962) (emphasis added). Likewise, Madison's Remonstrance stressed that "just govern-ment" is "best supported by protecting every citizen in the
enjoyment of his Religion with the same equal hand whichprotects his person and his property; by neither invading the
equal rights of any Sect, nor suffering any Sect to invade
those of another." Madison's Remonstrance || 8, reprintedin

Ewing, 330 U. S. 1, 64 (1947). Respondents' exclusion of religious activities from SAF funding creates this very problem. It requires University
officials to classify publications as "religious activities," and to discriminate against the publications that fall into that category. Such a policy
also contravenes the principles expressed in Madison's Remonstrance by
encouraging religious adherents to cleanse their speech of religious overtones, thus "degrad[ing] from the equal rank of Citizens all those whose
opinions in Religion do not bend to those of the Legislative authority."

every sect to perform their own religious duties," or from"establishing funds for the support of ministers, for public

charities, for the endowment of churches, or for the sepultureof the dead").

Stripped of its flawed historical premise, the dissent'sargument is reduced to the claim that our Establishment
Clause jurisprudence permits neutrality in the context of ac-cess to government

facilities but requires discrimination inaccess to government funds. The dissent purports to locate

the prohibition against "direct public funding" at the "heart"of the Establishment Clause, see post, at 878, but this conclusion fails to confront historical examples of funding that dateback to the time of the founding. To take but one famous
example, both Houses of the First Congress elected chap-lains, see S. Jour., 1st Cong., 1st Sess., 10 (1820 ed.); H. R.
Jour., 1st Cong., 1st Sess., 26 (1826 ed.), and that Congressenacted legislation providing for an annual salary of $500
to be paid out of the Treasury, see Act of Sept. 22, 1789,ch. 17, $ 4, 1 Stat. 70, 71. Madison himself was a member
of the committee that recommended the chaplain systemin the House. See H. R. Jour., at 11-12; 1 Annals of
Cong. 891 (1789); Cord, Separation of Church and State:Historical Fact and Current Fiction, at 25. This same
system of "direct public funding" of congressional chaplainshas "continued without interruption ever since that early
session of Congress." Marsh v. Chambers, 463 U. S. 783,788 (1983).

3

3 A number of other, less familiar examples of what amount to direct
funding appear in early Acts of Congress. See, e. g., Act of Feb. 20, 1833,
ch. 42, 4 Stat. 618-619 (authorizing the State of Ohio to sell "all or any
part of the lands heretofore reserved and appropriated by Congress for
the support of religion within the Ohio Company's . . . purchases . . . and
to invest the money arising from the sale thereof, in some productive fund;
the proceeds of which shall be for ever annually applied . . . for the support
of religion within the several townships for which said lands were originally reserved and set apart, and for no other use or purpose whatso515us3$91N 08-18-98 10:04:58 PAGES OPINPGT

The historical evidence of government support for reli-gious entities through property tax exemptions is also overwhelming. As the dissent concedes, property tax exemp-tions for religious bodies "have been in place for over 200
years without disruption to the interests represented by the
Establishment Clause." Post, at 881, n. 7 (citing Walz v. Tax
Comm'n of City of New York, 397 U. S. 664, 676-680 (1970)).4
In my view, the dissent's acceptance of this tradition puts to
rest the notion that the Establishment Clause bars monetary
aid to religious groups even when the aid is equally available
to other groups. A tax exemption in many cases is economically and functionally indistinguishable from a direct monetary subsidy.5 In one instance, the government relieves reliever"); Act of Mar. 2, 1833, ch. 86, $$ 1, 3, 6 Stat. 538 (granting to Georgetown College--a Jesuit institution--"lots in the city of Washington, to the
amount, in value, of twenty-five thousand dollars," and directing the College to sell the lots and invest the proceeds, thereafter using the dividends
to establish and endow such professorships as it saw fit); see also Wallace
v. Jaffree, 472 U. S. 38, 103 (1985) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting) ("As the
United States moved from the 18th into the 19th century, Congress appropriated time and again public moneys in support of sectarian Indian education carried on by religious organizations").

4 The Virginia experience during the period of the Assessment Controversy itself is inconsistent with the rigid "no-aid" principle embraced
by the dissent. Since at least 1777, the Virginia Legislature authorized
tax exemptions for property belonging to the "commonwealth, or to any
county, town, college, houses for divine worship, or seminary of learning."
Act of Jan. 23, 1800, ch. 2, $ 1, 1800 Va. Acts. And even Thomas Jefferson,
respondents' founder and a champion of disestablishment in Virginia, advocated the use of public funds in Virginia for a department of theology
in conjunction with other professional schools. See S. Padover, The Complete Jefferson 1067 (1943); see also id., at 958 (noting that Jefferson advocated giving "to the sectarian schools of divinity the full benefit [of] the
public provisions made for instruction in the other branches of science").

5 In the tax literature, this identity is called a "tax expenditure," a concept "based upon recognition of the fact that a government can appropriate money to a particular person or group by using a special, narrowly
directed tax deduction or exclusion, instead of by using its ordinary direct

gious entities (along with others) of a generally applicable
tax; in the other, it relieves religious entities (along with
others) of some or all of the burden of that tax by returning
it in the form of a cash subsidy. Whether the benefit is provided at the front or back end of the taxation process, the
financial aid to religious groups is undeniable. The analysis
under the Establishment Clause must also be the same: "Few
concepts are more deeply embedded in the fabric of our naspending mechanisms. For example, a government with a general income
tax, wanting to add $7,000 to the spendable income of a preacher whose
top tax rate is 30%, has two ways of subsidizing him. The government
can send the preacher a check for $10,000 and tax him on all of his income,
or it can authorize him to reduce his taxable income by $23,333.33 [resulting in a tax saving of $7,000]. If the direct payment were itself taxable
and did not alter his tax bracket, the preacher would receive the same
benefit from the tax deduction as he would from the direct payment."
Wolfman, Tax Expenditures: From Idea to Ideology, 99 Harv. L. Rev. 491,
491-492 (1985). In fact, Congress has provided a similar "tax expenditure" in $ 107 of the Internal Revenue Code by granting a " `minister of
the gospel' " an unlimited exclusion for the rental value of any home furnished as part of his pay or for the rental allowance paid to him. See id.,
at 492, n. 6.

Although Professor Bittker is certainly a leading scholar in the tax field,
the dissent's reliance on Bittker, see post, at 881, n. 7, is misplaced in this
context. See Adler, The Internal Revenue Code, The Constitution, and
the Courts: The Use of Tax Expenditure Analysis in Judicial Decision
Making, 28 Wake Forest L. Rev. 855, 862, n. 30 (1993):

"Early criticism of the tax expenditure concept focused on the difficulty
of drawing a dividing line between what is or is not a special provision.
Professor Boris Bittker, for example, argued that since no tax is all inclusive, exemptions from any tax could not be described as the equivalent of
subsidies. Boris I. Bittker, Churches, Taxes and the Constitution, 78
Yale L. J. 1285 (1969). This wholesale rejection of tax expenditure analysis was short-lived and attracted few supporters. Rather, the large body
of literature about tax expenditures accepts the basic concept that special
exemptions from tax function as subsidies. The current debate focuses
on whether particular items are correctly identified as tax expenditures
and whether incentive provisions are more efficient when structured as
tax expenditures rather than direct spending programs. See generally
[numerous authorities]."

Walz, supra, at 676-677.
Consistent application of the dissent's "no-aid" principle
would require that " `a church could not be protected by thepolice and fire departments, or have its public sidewalk kept

in repair.' " Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dist., 509U. S. 1, 8 (1993) (quoting

Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U. S. 263,

are not inhibited." Post, at 879, n. 5. Surely the dissent
must concede, however, that the same result should obtain
whether the government provides the populace with fire protection by reimbursing the costs of smoke detectors and
overhead sprinkler systems or by establishing a public fire
department. If churches may benefit on equal terms with
other groups in the latter program--that is, if a public fire
department may extinguish fires at churches--then they
may also benefit on equal terms in the former program.

Though our Establishment Clause jurisprudence is in
hopeless disarray, this case provides an opportunity to reaffirm one basic principle that has enjoyed an uncharacteristic
degree of consensus: The Clause does not compel the exclusion of religious groups from government benefits programs
that are generally available to a broad class of participants.

prisingly, the dissent offers no logical justification for thisconclusion, and none is evident in the text or original meaning of the First Amendment.If the Establishment Clause is offended when religious adherents benefit from neutral programs such as the University of Virginia's Student Activities Fund, it must also beoffended when they receive the same benefits in the form of

in-kind subsidies. The constitutional demands of the Estab-lishment Clause may be judged against either a baseline of
"neutrality" or a baseline of "no aid to religion," but the ap-propriate baseline surely cannot depend on the fortuitous circumstances surrounding the form of aid. The contrary rule
would lead to absurd results that would jettison centuries of
practice respecting the right of religious adherents to participate on neutral terms in a wide variety of governmentfunded programs.

Our Nation's tradition of allowing religious adherents to
participate in evenhanded government programs is hardly
limited to the class of "essential public benefits" identified by
the dissent. See post, at 879, n. 5. A broader tradition can
be traced at least as far back as the First Congress, which
ratified the Northwest Ordinance of 1787. See Act of Aug.
7, 1789, ch. 8, 1 Stat. 50. Article III of that famous enactment of the Confederation Congress had provided: "Religion,
morality, and knowledge . . . being necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means
of education shall forever be encouraged." Id., at 52, n. (a).
Congress subsequently set aside federal lands in the Northwest Territory and other territories for the use of schools.
See, e. g., Act of Mar. 3, 1803, ch. 21, $ 1, 2 Stat. 225-226; Act
of Mar. 26, 1804, ch. 35, $ 5, 2 Stat. 279; Act of Feb. 15, 1811,

Stat. 430; Act of Apr. 20, 1818, ch. 126, $ 2, 3 Stat. 467. Many
of the schools that enjoyed the benefits of these land grants
undoubtedly were church-affiliated sectarian institutions as
there was no requirement that the schools be "public." See

C. Antieau, A. Downey, & E. Roberts, Freedom From Fed-eral Establishment, Formation and Early History of the

First Amendment Religion Clauses 163 (1964). Neverthe-less, early Congresses found no problem with the provision
of such neutral benefits. See also id., at 174 (noting that
"almost universally[,] Americans from 1789 to 1825 acceptedand practiced governmental aid to religion and religiously

oriented educational institutions").Numerous other government benefits traditionally have
been available to religious adherents on neutral terms. Sev-eral examples may be found in the work of early Congresses,
including copyright protection for "the author and authorsof any map, chart, book or books," Act of May 31, 1790, ch.
15, $ 1, 1 Stat. 124, and a privilege allowing "every printer
of newspapers [to] send one paper to each and every other
printer of newspapers within the United States, free of postage," Act of Feb. 20, 1792, ch. 7, $ 21, 1 Stat. 238. Neither
of these laws made any exclusion for the numerous authors
or printers who manifested a belief in or about a deity.

Thus, history provides an answer for the constitutional
question posed by this case, but it is not the one given by the
dissent. The dissent identifies no evidence that the Framers
intended to disable religious entities from participating on
neutral terms in evenhanded government programs. The
evidence that does exist points in the opposite direction and
provides ample support for today's decision.

Justice Souter, with whom Justice Stevens, Justice
Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer join, dissenting.

The Court today, for the first time, approves direct funding
of core religious activities by an arm of the State. It does
so, however, only after erroneous treatment of some familiar
principles of law implementing the First Amendment's Establishment and Speech Clauses, and by viewing the very
funds in question as beyond the reach of the Establishment
Clause's funding restrictions as such. Because there is no

The central question in this case is whether a grant fromthe Student Activities Fund to pay Wide Awake's printing

expenses would violate the Establishment Clause. Al-though the Court does not dwell on the details of Wide
Awake's message, it recognizes something sufficiently reli-gious in the publication to demand Establishment Clause
scrutiny. Although the Court places great stress on the eli-gibility of secular as well as religious activities for grants
from the Student Activities Fund, it recognizes that suchevenhanded availability is not by itself enough to satisfy constitutional requirements for any aid scheme that results in abenefit to religion.

O'Connor, J., concurring). Something more is necessaryto justify any religious aid. Some Members of the Court, at

least, may think the funding permissible on a view that it isindirect, since the money goes to Wide Awake's printer, not
through Wide Awake's own checking account. The Court'sprincipal reliance, however, is on an argument that providing
religion with economically valuable services is permissibleon the theory that services are economically indistinguishable from religious access to governmental speech forums,which sometimes is permissible. But this reasoning would
commit the Court to approving direct religious aid beyondanything justifiable for the sake of access to speaking forums. The Court implicitly recognizes this in its further at-tempt to circumvent the clear bar to direct governmental aid
to religion. Different Members of the Court seek to avoidthis bar in different ways. The opinion of the Court makes

in public universities may benefit, so long as there is no con-sequent endorsement of religion. The resulting decision is

in unmistakable tension with the accepted law that the Courtcontinues to avow.

The Court's difficulties will be all the more clear after a
closer look at Wide Awake than the majority opinion affords.The character of the magazine is candidly disclosed on the

opening page of the first issue, where the editor-in-chief an-nounces Wide Awake's mission in a letter to the readership
signed, "Love in Christ": it is "to challenge Christians tolive, in word and deed, according to the faith they proclaim
and to encourage students to consider what a personal relationship with Jesus Christ means." App. 45. The mast-head of every issue bears St. Paul's exhortation, that "[t]he

hour has come for you to awake from your slumber, becauseour salvation is nearer now than when we first believed.
Romans 13:11."Each issue of Wide Awake contained in the record makes
good on the editor's promise and echoes the Apostle's call toaccept salvation:

"The only way to salvation through Him is by confessingand repenting of sin. It is the Christian's duty to make
sinners aware of their need for salvation. Thus, Christians must confront and condemn sin, or else they fail
in their duty of love." Mourad & Prince, A Love/Hate
Relationship, Nov. /Dec. 1990, p. 3.

clude with the counsel to take action because that is theChristian thing to do:

"God calls us to take the risks of voluntarily steppingout of our comfort zones and to take joy in the whole

with all peoples of the world."Racism is a disease of the heart, soul, and mind, and

The same progression occurs in an article on eating disor-ders, which begins with descriptions of anorexia and bulimia

and ends with this religious message:

This writing is no merely descriptive examination of reli-gious doctrine or even of ideal Christian practice in confronting life's social and personal problems. Nor is it merely theexpression of editorial opinion that incidentally coincides
with Christian ethics and reflects a Christian view of humanobligation. It is straightforward exhortation to enter into a
relationship with God as revealed in Jesus Christ, and tosatisfy a series of moral obligations derived from the teachings of Jesus Christ. These are not the words of "studentnews, information, opinion, entertainment, or academic communicatio[n] . . ." (in the language of the University's funding

criterion, App. to Pet. for Cert. 61a), but the words of "challenge [to] Christians to live, in word and deed, according to
the faith they proclaim and . . . to consider what a personal
relationship with Jesus Christ means" (in the language of
Wide Awake's founder, App. 45). The subject is not the discourse of the scholar's study or the seminar room, but of
the evangelist's mission station and the pulpit. It is nothing
other than the preaching of the word, which (along with the
sacraments) is what most branches of Christianity offer
those called to the religious life.

Using public funds for the direct subsidization of preaching the word is categorically forbidden under the Establishment Clause, and if the Clause was meant to accomplish
nothing else, it was meant to bar this use of public money.
Evidence on the subject antedates even the Bill of Rights
itself, as may be seen in the writings of Madison, whose authority on questions about the meaning of the Establishment
Clause is well settled, e. g., Committee for Public Ed. & Religious Liberty v. Nyquist, 413 U. S. 756, 770, n. 28 (1973); Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U. S. 1, 13 (1947). Four
years before the First Congress proposed the First Amendment, Madison gave his opinion on the legitimacy of using
public funds for religious purposes, in the Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments, which played
the central role in ensuring the defeat of the Virginia tax
assessment bill in 1786 and framed the debate upon which
the Religion Clauses stand:

"Who does not see that . . . the same authority which
can force a citizen to contribute three pence only of his
property for the support of any one establishment, may
force him to conform to any other establishment in all
cases whatsoever?" James Madison, Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments || 3 (hereinafter Madison's Remonstrance), reprinted in Everson,
supra, at 65-66 (appendix to dissent of Rutledge, J.).

Madison wrote against a background in which nearly everyColony had exacted a tax for church support, Everson,

supra, at 10, n. 8, the practice having become "so common-place as to shock the freedom-loving colonials into a feeling
of abhorrence," 330 U. S., at 11 (footnote omitted). Madi-son's Remonstrance captured the colonists' "conviction that
individual religious liberty could be achieved best under agovernment which was stripped of all power to tax, to support, or otherwise to assist any or all religions, or to inter-fere with the beliefs of any religious individual or group."
Ibid.1 Their sentiment, as expressed by Madison in Virginia,

1 Justice Thomas suggests that Madison would have approved of the
assessment bill if only it had satisfied the principle of evenhandedness.
Nowhere in the Remonstrance, however, did Madison advance the view
that Virginia should be able to provide financial support for religion as
part of a generally available subsidy program. Indeed, while Justice
Thomas claims that the "funding provided by the Virginia assessment was
to be extended only to Christian sects," ante, at 855, it is clear that the bill
was more general in scope than this. While the bill, which is reprinted
in Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U. S. 1, 72-74 (1947), provided
that each taxpayer could designate a religious society to which he wanted
his levy paid, id., at 73, it would also have allowed a taxpayer to refuse to
appropriate his levy to any religious society, in which case the legislature
was to use these unappropriated sums to fund "seminaries of learning."
Id., at 74 (contrary to Justice Thomas's unsupported assertion, this
portion of the bill was no less obligatory than any other). While some of
these seminaries undoubtedly would have been religious in character, others would not have been, as a seminary was generally understood at the
time to be "any school, academy, college or university, in which young
persons are instructed in the several branches of learning which may qualify them for their future employments." N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language (1st ed. 1828); see also 14 The Oxford
English Dictionary 956 (2d ed. 1989). Not surprisingly, then, scholars
have generally agreed that the bill would have provided funding for nonreligious schools. See, e. g., Laycock, "Nonpreferential" Aid to Religion: A
False Claim About Original Intent, 27 Wm. & Mary L. Rev. 875, 897, and
n. 108 (1986) ("Any taxpayer could refuse to designate a church, with undesignated church taxes going to a fund for schools. . . . The bill used
the phrase `seminaries of learning,' which almost certainly meant schools
generally and not just schools for the training of ministers"); T. Buckley,

led not only to the defeat of Virginia's tax assessment bill,
but also directly to passage of the Virginia Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom, written by Thomas Jefferson. That

Church and State in Revolutionary Virginia, 1776-1787, p. 133 (1977) ("The
assessment had been carefully drafted to permit those who preferred to
support education rather than religion to do so"); T. Curry, The First Freedoms 141 (1986) ("[T]hose taxes not designated for any specific denomination [were] allocated to education"). It is beside the point that "there was
no system of public education in Virginia until several decades after the
assessment bill was proposed," ante, at 854, n. 1 (Thomas, J., concurring);
because the bill was never passed, the funds that it would have made
available for secular, public schools never materialized. The fact that the
bill, if passed, would have funded secular as well as religious instruction
did nothing to soften Madison's opposition to it.

Nor is it fair to argue that Madison opposed the bill only because it
treated religious groups unequally. Ante, at 854-855 (Thomas, J., concurring). In various paragraphs of the Remonstrance, Madison did complain
about the bill's peculiar burdens and exemptions, Everson, supra, at 66,
but to identify this factor as the sole point of Madison's opposition to the
bill is unfaithful to the Remonstrance's text. Madison strongly inveighed
against the proposed aid for religion for a host of reasons (the Remonstrance numbers 15 paragraphs, each containing at least one point in opposition), and crucial here is the fact that many of those reasons would have
applied whether or not the state aid was being distributed equally among
sects, and whether or not the aid was going to those sects in the context of
an evenhanded government program. See, e. g., Madison's Remonstrance,
reprinted in Everson, 330 U. S., at 64, || 1 ("[I]n matters of Religion, no
man's right is abridged by the institution of Civil Society, and . . . Religion
is wholly exempt from its cognizance"); id., at 67, || 6 (arguing that state
support of religion "is a contradiction to the Christian Religion itself; for
every page of it disavows a dependence on the powers of this world");
ibid., || 7 ("[E]xperience witnesseth that ecclesiastical establishments, instead of maintaining the purity and efficacy of Religion, have had a contrary operation"). Madison's objections were supplemented by numerous
other petitions in opposition to the bill that likewise do not suggest that
the lack of evenhandedness was its dispositive flaw. L. Levy, The Establishment Clause: Religion and the First Amendment 63-67 (2d ed. 1994).
For example, the petition that received the largest number of signatories
was motivated by the view that religion should only be supported voluntarily. Id., at 63-64. Indeed, Madison's Remonstrance did not argue for
a bill distributing aid to all sects and religions on an equal basis, and the

bill's preamble declared that "to compel a man to furnishcontributions of money for the propagation of opinions which

he disbelieves, is sinful and tyrannical," Jefferson, A Bill forEstablishing Religious Freedom, reprinted in 5 The Founder's Constitution 84 (P. Kurland & R. Lerner eds. 1987), andits text provided "[t]hat no man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship, place, or ministrywhatsoever . . . ,"

id., at 85. See generally Everson, 330U. S., at 13. We have "previously recognized that the provisions of the First Amendment, in the drafting and adoptionof which Madison and Jefferson played such leading roles,
had the same objective and were intended to provide thesame protection against governmental intrusion on religious
liberty as the Virginia statute." Ibid.; see also Laycock,"Nonpreferential" Aid to Religion: A False Claim About
Original Intent, 27 Wm. & Mary L. Rev. 875, 921, 923 (1986)("[I]f the debates of the 1780's support any proposition, it is
that the Framers opposed government financial support forreligion. . . . They did not substitute small taxes for large
taxes; three pence was as bad as any larger sum. The prin-ciple was what mattered. With respect to money, religion
was to be wholly voluntary. Churches either would support
outgrowth of the Remonstrance and the defeat of the Virginia assessment
was not such a bill; rather, it was the Virginia Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom, which, as discussed in the text, proscribed the use of tax
dollars for religious purposes.

In attempting to recast Madison's opposition as having principally been
targeted against "governmental preferences for particular religious
faiths," ante, at 856 (emphasis in original), Justice Thomas wishes to
wage a battle that was lost long ago, for "this Court has rejected unequivocally the contention that the Establishment Clause forbids only governmental preference of one religion over another," School Dist. of Abington
Township v. Schempp, 374 U. S. 203, 216 (1963); see also Texas Monthly,

themselves or they would not, but the government wouldneither help nor interfere") (footnote omitted); T. Curry, The

First Freedoms 217 (1986) (At the time of the framing ofthe Bill of Rights, "[t]he belief that government assistance
to religion, especially in the form of taxes, violated religious
liberty had a long history"); J. Choper, Securing Religious
Liberty 16 (1995) ("There is broad consensus that a central
threat to the religious freedom of individuals and groups--
indeed, in the judgment of many the most serious infringement upon religious liberty--is posed by forcing them to pay
taxes in support of a religious establishment or religious
activities") (footnotes omitted; internal quotation marks
omitted).2

2 Justice Thomas attempts to cast doubt on this accepted version of
Establishment Clause history by reference to historical facts that are
largely inapposite. Ante, at 857-858, 862-863 (concurring opinion). As I
have said elsewhere, individual Acts of Congress, especially when they are
few and far between, scarcely serve as an authoritative guide to the meaning of the Religion Clauses, for "like other politicians, [members of the
early Congresses] could raise constitutional ideals one day and turn their
backs on them the next. [For example,] . . . [t]en years after proposing
the First Amendment, Congress passed the Alien and Sedition Acts, measures patently unconstitutional by modern standards. If the early Congress's political actions were determinative, and not merely relevant, evidence of constitutional meaning, we would have to gut our current First
Amendment doctrine to make room for political censorship." Lee v. Weisman, supra, at 626 (concurring opinion). The legislation cited by Justice
Thomas, including the Northwest Ordinance, is no more dispositive than
the Alien and Sedition Acts in interpreting the First Amendment. Even
less persuasive, then, are citations to constitutionally untested Acts dating
from the mid-19th century, for without some rather innovative argument,
they cannot be offered as providing an authoritative gloss on the Framers' intent.

Justice Thomas's references to Madison's actions as a legislator also
provide little support for his cause. Justice Thomas seeks to draw a
significant lesson out of the fact that, in seeking to disestablish the Anglican Church in Virginia in 1776, Madison did not inveigh against state funding of religious activities. Ante, at 857 (concurring opinion). That was

The principle against direct funding with public money is
patently violated by the contested use of today's student activity fee.3 Like today's taxes generally, the fee is Madison's
threepence. The University exercises the power of the
State to compel a student to pay it, see Jefferson's Preamble,
supra, and the use of any part of it for the direct support of
religious activity thus strikes at what we have repeatedly

not the task at hand, however. Madison was acting with the specific goal
of eliminating the special privileges enjoyed by Virginia Anglicans, and
he made no effort to lay out the broader views of church and state that
came to bear in his drafting of the First Amendment some 13 years later.
That Madison did not speak in more expansive terms than necessary in
1776 was hardly surprising for, as it was, his proposal was defeated by the
Virginia Convention as having gone too far. Ibid.

Similarly, the invocation of Madison's tenure on the congressional committee that approved funding for legislative chaplains provides no support
for more general principles that run counter to settled Establishment
Clause jurisprudence. As I have previously pointed out, Madison, upon
retirement, "insisted that `it was not with my approbation, that the deviation from [the immunity of religion from civil jurisdiction] took place in
Congs., when they appointed Chaplains, to be paid from the Natl. Treasury.' " Lee, 505 U. S., at 625, n. 6, quoting Letter from J. Madison to E.
Livingston (July 10, 1822), in 5 The Founders' Constitution 105 (P. Kurland & R. Lerner eds. (1987)). And when we turned our attention to
deciding whether funding of legislative chaplains posed an establishment
problem, we did not address the practice as one instance of a larger class
of permissible government funding of religious activities. Instead, Marsh
v. Chambers, 463 U. S. 783, 791 (1983), explicitly relied on the singular,
200-year pedigree of legislative chaplains, noting that "[t]his unique history" justified carving out an exception for the specific practice in question. Given that the decision upholding this practice was expressly limited to its facts, then, it would stand the Establishment Clause on its head
to extract from it a broad rule permitting the funding of religious
activities.

3 In the District Court, the parties agreed to the following facts: "The

University of Virginia has charged at all times relevant herein and currently charges each full-time student a compulsory student activity fee of
$14.00 per semester. There is no procedural or other mechanism by which
a student may decline to pay the fee." App. 37; see also id., at 9, 21.

Even when the Court has upheld aid to an institution performing both secular and sectarian functions, it has always
made a searching enquiry to ensure that the institution kept
the secular activities separate from its sectarian ones, with
any direct aid flowing only to the former and never the latter.

Why does the Court not apply this clear law to these clear
facts and conclude, as I do, that the funding scheme here is
a clear constitutional violation? The answer must be in part
that the Court fails to confront the evidence set out in the
preceding section. Throughout its opinion, the Court refers
uninformatively to Wide Awake's "Christian viewpoint,"
ante, at 826, or its "religious perspective," ante, at 832, and
in distinguishing funding of Wide Awake from the funding of
a church, the Court maintains that "[Wide Awake] is not a
religious institution, at least in the usual sense," ante, at

844; 4 see also ante, at 826. The Court does not quote themagazine's adoption of Saint Paul's exhortation to awaken to

the nearness of salvation, or any of its articles enjoiningreaders to accept Jesus Christ, or the religious verses, or the
religious textual analyses, or the suggested prayers. Andso it is easy for the Court to lose sight of what the University
students and the Court of Appeals found so obvious, and toblanch the patently and frankly evangelistic character of
the magazine by unrevealing allusions to religious points ofview.

Nevertheless, even without the encumbrance of detailfrom Wide Awake's actual pages, the Court finds something
sufficiently religious about the magazine to require examina-tion under the Establishment Clause, and one may therefore
ask why the unequivocal prohibition on direct funding doesnot lead the Court to conclude that funding would be unconstitutional. The answer is that the Court focuses on a sub-sidiary body of law, which it correctly states but ultimately
misapplies. That subsidiary body of law accounts for theCourt's substantial attention to the fact that the University's
funding scheme is "neutral," in the formal sense that itmakes funds available on an evenhanded basis to secular and
sectarian applicants alike. Ante, at 839-842. While this isindeed true and relevant under our cases, it does not alone
satisfy the requirements of the Establishment Clause, as theCourt recognizes when it says that evenhandedness is only
a "significant factor" in certain Establishment Clause analy-sis, not a dispositive one. Ante, at 839; see ante, at 840-841;

formally neutral criteria and remain studiously oblivious tothe effects of its actions. . . . [N]ot all state policies are permissible under the Religion Clauses simply because they are
neutral in form"). This recognition reflects the Court's ap-preciation of two general rules: that whenever affirmative

government aid ultimately benefits religion, the Establish-ment Clause requires some justification beyond evenhandedness on the government's part; and that direct public fundingof core sectarian activities, even if accomplished pursuant to
an evenhanded program, would be entirely inconsistent with
the Establishment Clause and would strike at the very heart
of the Clause's protection. See ante, at 842 ("We do not confront a case where, even under a neutral program that includes nonsectarian recipients, the government is making direct money payments to an institution or group that is
engaged in religious activity"); ante, at 840-841, 844; see also
ante, at 847 (O'Connor, J., concurring) ("[Our] decisions . . .
provide no precedent for the use of public funds to finance
religious activities").

In order to understand how the Court thus begins with
sound rules but ends with an unsound result, it is necessary
to explore those rules in greater detail than the Court does.
As the foregoing quotations from the Court's opinion indicate, the relationship between the prohibition on direct aid
and the requirement of evenhandedness when affirmative
government aid does result in some benefit to religion reflects the relationship between basic rule and marginal criterion. At the heart of the Establishment Clause stands the
prohibition against direct public funding, but that prohibition
does not answer the questions that occur at the margins of
the Clause's application. Is any government activity that
provides any incidental benefit to religion likewise unconstitutional? Would it be wrong to put out fires in burning
churches, wrong to pay the bus fares of students on the way

to parochial schools, wrong to allow a grantee of special edu-cation funds to spend them at a religious college? These are

the questions that call for drawing lines, and it is in drawingthem that evenhandedness becomes important. However
the Court may in the past have phrased its line-drawing test,the question whether such benefits are provided on an evenhanded basis has been relevant, for the question addressesone aspect of the issue whether a law is truly neutral with
respect to religion (that is, whether the law either "ad-vance[s] [or] inhibit[s] religion,"

See also Board of Ed. of Kiryas Joel Village School Dist. v.
Grumet, 512 U. S. 687, 702-705 (1994). In the doubtful cases(those not involving direct public funding), where there is

initially room for argument about a law's effect, evenhanded-ness serves to weed out those laws that impermissibly advance religion by channelling aid to it exclusively. Even-handedness is therefore a prerequisite to further enquiry
into the constitutionality of a doubtful law,5 but evenhanded-ness goes no further. It does not guarantee success under
Establishment Clause scrutiny.Three cases permitting indirect aid to religion, Mueller v.

stitutional. Each case involved a program in which benefits
given to individuals on a religion-neutral basis ultimately
were used by the individuals, in one way or another, to support religious institutions.6 In each, the fact that aid was
distributed generally and on a neutral basis was a necessary
condition for upholding the program at issue. Witters,
supra, at 487-488; Mueller, supra, at 397-399; Zobrest,
supra, at 10-11. But the significance of evenhandedness
stopped there. We did not, in any of these cases, hold that
satisfying the condition was sufficient, or dispositive. Even
more importantly, we never held that evenhandedness might
be sufficient to render direct aid to religion constitutional.
Quite the contrary. Critical to our decisions in these cases
was the fact that the aid was indirect; it reached religious
institutions "only as a result of the genuinely independent
and private choices of aid recipients," Witters, supra, at 487;
see also Mueller, supra, at 399-400; Zobrest, supra, at 10-13.
In noting and relying on this particular feature of each of
the programs at issue, we in fact reaffirmed the core prohibition on direct funding of religious activities. See Zobrest,
supra, at 12-13; Witters, supra, at 487; see also Mueller,
supra, at 399-400. Thus, our holdings in these cases were
little more than extensions of the unremarkable proposition
that "a State may issue a paycheck to one of its employees,
who may then donate all or part of that paycheck to a religious institution, all without constitutional barrier . . . ."

a tax deduction, available for parents of both public and nonpublic schoolchildren, for certain expenses incurred in connection with providing education for their children in private religious schools.

7 Walz v. Tax Comm'n of City of New York, 397 U. S. 664 (1970), is yet
another example of a case in which the Court treated the general availability of a government benefit as a significant condition defining compliance
with the Establishment Clause, but did not deem that condition sufficient.
In upholding state property tax exemptions given to religious organizations in Walz, we noted that the law at issue was applicable to "a broad
class of property owned by nonprofit [and] quasi-public corporations," id.,
at 673, but did not rest on that factor alone. Critical to our decision was
the central principle that direct funding of religious activities is prohibited
under the Establishment Clause. "It is sufficient to note that for the men
who wrote the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment the `establishment' of a religion connoted sponsorship, financial support, and active
involvement of the sovereign in religious activity." Id., at 668. We emphasized that the tax exemptions did not involve the expenditure of government funds in support of religious activities. "The grant of a tax exemption is not sponsorship since the government does not transfer part of
its revenue to churches but simply abstains from demanding that the
church support the state." Id., at 675. Moreover, we noted that in the
property taxation context, "exemption[s] creat[e] only a minimal and remote involvement between church and state and far less than taxation of
churches," and in operation "ten[d] to complement and reinforce the desired separation insulating" church and state, id., at 676; and that religious
property tax exemptions have been in place for over 200 years without
disruption to the interests represented by the Establishment Clause, id.,
at 676-680.

Justice Thomas's assertion, that "[a] tax exemption in many cases is
economically and functionally indistinguishable from a direct monetary
subsidy," ante, at 859 (concurring opinion) (footnote omitted), assumes that
the "natural" or "correct" tax base is so self-evident that any provision
excusing a person or institution from taxes to which others are subjected
must be a departure from the natural tax base rather than part of the
definition of the tax base itself. The equivalence (asserted by Justice
Thomas, ibid.) between a direct money subsidy and the tax liability
avoided by an institution (because it is part of the class of institutions that
defines the relevant tax base by its exclusion) was tested and dispatched
long ago by Professor Bittker in Churches, Taxes and the Constitution, 78

Evenhandedness as one element of a permissibly attenuated benefit is, of course, a far cry from evenhandedness as
a sufficient condition of constitutionality for direct financial
support of religious proselytization, and our cases have unsurprisingly repudiated any such attempt to cut the Establishment Clause down to a mere prohibition against unequal
direct aid. See, e. g., Tilton v. Richardson, 403 U. S., at 682-
684 (striking portion of general aid program providing grants
for construction of college and university facilities to the extent program made possible the use of funds for sectarian
activities); 8 Wolman v. Walter, 433 U. S., at 252-255 (striking
funding of field trips for nonpublic school students, such as
are "provided to public school students in the district," because of unacceptable danger that state funds would be used
to foster religion). And nowhere has the Court's adherence
to the preeminence of the no-direct-funding principle over
the principle of evenhandedness been as clear as in Bowen v.
Kendrick, 487 U. S. 589 (1988).

Bowen involved consideration of the Adolescent Family
Life Act (AFLA), a federal grant program providing funds
to institutions for counseling and educational services related
to adolescent sexuality and pregnancy. At the time of the
litigation, 141 grants had been awarded under the AFLA to

on Bittker . . . is misplaced in this context," ante, at 860, n. 5, is not on
point. Even granting that Justice Thomas's assertion of equivalence is
reasonable, he cannot and does not deny the fact that the Court in Walz
explicitly distinguished tax exemptions from direct money subsidies, 397
U. S., at 675, and rested its decision on that distinction. If Justice
Thomas's assertion of equivalence should prevail then the Walz Court
necessarily was wrong about a distinction critical to its holding. Justice
Thomas can hardly use Walz coherently for support after removing the
basis on which it relies.

8 Although the main opinion in Tilton was a plurality, the entire Court

was unanimous on this point. See 403 U. S., at 682-684 (plurality opinion); id., at 692 (Douglas, J., joined by Black and Marshall, JJ., concurring
in part and dissenting in part); Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602, 659-661

a broad array of both secular and religiously affiliated insti-tutions.

Id., at 597. In an Establishment Clause challenge
to the Act brought by taxpayers and other interested par-ties, the District Court resolved the case on a pretrial motion

for summary judgment, holding the AFLA program unconstitutional both on its face and also insofar as religious insti-tutions were involved in receiving grants under the Act.

When this Court reversed on the issue of facial constitution-ality under the Establishment Clause,

id., at 602-618, we
said that there was "no intimation in the statute that at somepoint, or for some grantees, religious uses are permitted."

Id., at 614. On the contrary, after looking at the legislative
history and applicable regulations, we found safeguards adequate to ensure that grants would not be "used by . . . grantees in such a way as to advance religion." Id., at 615.

With respect to the claim that the program was unconstitutional as applied, we remanded the case to the District
Court "for consideration of the evidence presented by appellees insofar as it sheds light on the manner in which the
statute is presently being administered." Id., at 621. Specifically, we told the District Court, on remand, to "consider
. . . whether in particular cases AFLA aid has been used to
fund `specifically religious activit[ies] in an otherwise substantially secular setting.' " Ibid., quoting Hunt v. McNair,
413 U. S., at 743. In giving additional guidance to the District Court, we suggested that application of the Act would
be unconstitutional if it turned out that aid recipients were
using materials "that have an explicitly religious content or
are designed to inculcate the views of a particular religious
faith." Bowen, 487 U. S., at 621. At no point in our opinion
did we suggest that the breadth of potential recipients, or
distribution on an evenhanded basis, could have justified the
use of federal funds for religious activities, a position that
would have made no sense after we had pegged the Act's
facial constitutionality to our conclusion that advancement of
religion was not inevitable. Justice O'Connor's separate

opinion in the case underscored just this point: "I fully agree. . . that `[p]ublic funds may not be used to endorse the

religious message.' [487 U. S.,] at 642 [(Blackmun, J.,dissenting)]. . . . [A]ny use of public funds to promote religious doctrines violates the Establishment Clause." Id., at622-623 (concurring opinion) (emphasis in original).

Bowen was no sport; its pedigree was the line of Eversonv.

Board of Ed., 330 U. S., at 16-18, Board of Ed. v. Allen,392 U. S., at 243-249, Tilton v. Richardson, supra, at 678-

682, Hunt v. McNair, supra, at 742-745, and Roemer v.Board of Public Works of Md., 426 U. S., at 759-761. Each
of these cases involved a general aid program that providedbenefits to a broad array of secular and sectarian institutions
on an evenhanded basis, but in none of them was that factdispositive. The plurality opinion in

Roemer made thispoint exactly:

"The Court has taken the view that a secular purposeand a facial neutrality may not be enough, if in fact the
State is lending direct support to a religious activity.The State may not, for example, pay for what is actually
a religious education, even though it purports to be pay-ing for a secular one, and even though it makes its aid
available to secular and religious institutions alike."426 U. S., at 747 (opinion of Blackmun, J.).

Instead, the central enquiry in each of these general aidcases, as in

Bowen, was whether secular activities could beseparated from the sectarian ones sufficiently to ensure that

aid would flow to the secular alone.

Witters, Mueller, and Zobrest expressly preserve thestandard thus exhibited so often. Each of these cases explicitly distinguished the indirect aid in issue from contrast-ing examples in the line of cases striking down direct aid,
and each thereby expressly preserved the core constitutionalprinciple that direct aid to religion is impermissible. See
Zobrest, 509 U. S., at 11-13 (distinguishing Meek v. Pittenger,421 U. S. 349 (1975), and

School Dist. v. Ball, 473 U. S. 373(1985), and noting that " `[t]he State may not grant aid to a

(quoting Witters, 474 U. S., at 487); see also ibid.; Mueller,463 U. S., at 399. It appears that the University perfectly
understood the primacy of the no-direct-funding rule over
the evenhandedness principle when it drew the line short offunding "an[y] activity which primarily promotes or manifests a particular belief(s) in or about a deity or an ultimate
reality." 9 App. to Pet. for Cert. 66a.

C
Since conformity with the marginal or limiting principle ofevenhandedness is insufficient of itself to demonstrate the

constitutionality of providing a government benefit thatreaches religion, the Court must identify some further element in the funding scheme that does demonstrate its per-missibility. For one reason or another, the Court's chosen
element appears to be the fact that under the University'sGuidelines, funds are sent to the printer chosen by Wide
Awake, rather than to Wide Awake itself. Ante, at 842-844.

1
If the Court's suggestion is that this feature of the fund-ing program brings this case into line with

Witters, Mueller,and Zobrest (discussed supra, at 879-881), the Court has misread those cases, which turned on the fact that the choice tobenefit religion was made by a nonreligious third party
standing between the government and a religious institu-tion. See

Witters, supra, at 487; see also Mueller, supra, at399-400; Zobrest, supra, at 8-13. Here there is no thirdparty standing between the government and the ultimatereligious beneficiary to break the circuit by its independent
discretion to put state money to religious use. The printer,of course, has no option to take the money and use it to print
a secular journal instead of Wide Awake. It only gets themoney because of its contract to print a message of religious
evangelism at the direction of Wide Awake, and it will re-ceive payment only for doing precisely that. The formalism
of distinguishing between payment to Wide Awake so it canpay an approved bill and payment of the approved bill itself
cannot be the basis of a decision of constitutional law. If

this indeed were a critical distinction, the Constitution wouldpermit a State to pay all the bills of any religious institution; 10 in fact, despite the Court's purported adherence tothe no-direct-funding principle, the State could simply hand
out credit cards to religious institutions and honor themonthly statements (so long as someone could devise an
evenhanded umbrella to cover the whole scheme). Witters
and the other cases cannot be distinguished out of existencethis way.

2
It is more probable, however, that the Court's reference to
the printer goes to a different attempt to justify the pay-ment. On this purported justification, the payment to the

printer is significant only as the last step in an argumentresting on the assumption that a public university may give
a religious group the use of any of its equipment or facilitiesso long as secular groups are likewise eligible. The Court
starts with the cases of Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U. S. 263(1981),

Board of Ed. of Westside Community Schools (Dist.
66) v. Mergens, 496 U. S. 226 (1990), and Lamb's Chapel v.
Center Moriches Union Free School Dist., 508 U. S. 384(1993), in which religious groups were held to be entitled to

access for speaking in government buildings open generally
for that purpose. The Court reasons that the availability
of a forum has economic value (the government built and
maintained the building, while the speakers saved the rent
for a hall); and that economically there is no difference be10 The Court acknowledges that "if the State pays a church's bills it is
subsidizing it," and concedes that "we must guard against this abuse."
Ante, at 844. These concerns are not present here, the Court contends,
because Wide Awake "is not a religious institution, at least in the usual
sense of that term as used in our case law." Ibid. The Court's concession suggests that its distinction between paying a religious institution
and paying a religious institution's bills is not really significant. But if
the Court is relying on its characterization of Wide Awake as not a religious institution, "at least in the usual sense," the Court could presumably
stop right there.

tween the University's provision of the value of the room andthe value, say, of the University's printing equipment; and

that therefore the University must be able to provide theuse of the latter. Since it may do that, the argument goes,
it would be unduly formalistic to draw the line at paying
for an outside printer, who simply does what the magazine'spublishers could have done with the University's own printing equipment. Ante, at 843-844.The argument is as unsound as it is simple, and the first
of its troubles emerges from an examination of the cases re-lied upon to support it. The common factual thread running
through Widmar, Mergens, and Lamb's Chapel is that a governmental institution created a limited forum for the use of
students in a school or college, or for the public at large, but
sought to exclude speakers with religious messages. See
generally Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators' Assn.,
460 U. S. 37, 45-46 (1983) (forum analysis). In each case the
restriction was struck down either as an impermissible attempt to regulate the content of speech in an open forum (as
in Widmar and Mergens) or to suppress a particular religious viewpoint (as in Lamb's Chapel, see infra, at 897-898).
In each case, to be sure, the religious speaker's use of the
room passed muster as an incident of a plan to facilitate
speech generally for a secular purpose, entailing neither secular entanglement with religion nor risk that the religious
speech would be taken to be the speech of the government
or that the government's endorsement of a religious message
would be inferred. But each case drew ultimately on unexceptionable Speech Clause doctrine treating the evangelist,
the Salvation Army, the millennialist, or the Hare Krishna
like any other speaker in a public forum. It was the preservation of free speech on the model of the street corner that
supplied the justification going beyond the requirement of
evenhandedness.

The Court's claim of support from these forum-access
cases is ruled out by the very scope of their holdings. While

they do indeed allow a limited benefit to religious speakers,they rest on the recognition that all speakers are entitled to

use the street corner (even though the State paves the roadsand provides police protection to everyone on the street) and
on the analogy between the public street corner and openclassroom space. Thus, the Court found it significant that
the classroom speakers would engage in traditional speechactivities in these forums, too, even though the rooms (like
street corners) require some incidental state spending tomaintain them. The analogy breaks down entirely, however, if the cases are read more broadly than the Court wrotethem, to cover more than forums for literal speaking. There
is no traditional street corner printing provided by the gov-ernment on equal terms to all comers, and the forum cases
cannot be lifted to a higher plane of generalization withoutadmitting that new economic benefits are being extended
directly to religion in clear violation of the principle barringdirect aid. The argument from economic equivalence thus
breaks down on recognizing that the direct state aid it wouldsupport is not mitigated by the street corner analogy in the
service of free speech. Absent that, the rule against directaid stands as a bar to printing services as well as printers.

3
It must, indeed, be a recognition of just this point thatleads the Court to take a third tack, not in coming up with

yet a third attempt at justification within the rules of exist-ing case law, but in recasting the scope of the Establishment
Clause in ways that make further affirmative justificationunnecessary.

Justice O'Connor makes a comprehensiveanalysis of the manner in which the activity fee is assessed

and distributed. She concludes that the funding differs sosharply from religious funding out of governmental treasuries generally that it falls outside Establishment Clause's pur-view in the absence of a message of religious endorsement
(which she finds not to be present). Ante, at 849-852 (con515us3$91M 08-18-98 10:04:59 PAGES OPINPGT

curring opinion). The opinion of the Court concludes moreexpansively that the activity fee is not a tax, and then proceeds to find the aid permissible on the legal assumption thatthe bar against direct aid applies only to aid derived from
tax revenue. I have already indicated why it is fanciful to
treat the fee as anything but a tax, supra, at 873-874, andn. 3; see also

ante, at 840 (noting mandatory nature of the
fee), and will not repeat the point again. The novelty of theassumption that the direct aid bar only extends to aid derived from taxation, however, requires some response.Although it was a taxation scheme that moved Madison to
write in the first instance, the Court has never held thatgovernment resources obtained without taxation could be
used for direct religious support, and our cases on direct government aid have frequently spoken in terms in no way lim-ited to tax revenues.

E. g., School Dist. v. Ball, 473 U. S.,
at 385 ("Although Establishment Clause jurisprudence ischaracterized by few absolutes, the Clause does absolutely

prohibit government-financed or government-sponsored in-doctrination into the beliefs of a particular religious faith");

ignore one of the dual objectives of the EstablishmentClause, which was meant not only to protect individuals and
their republics from the destructive consequences of mix-ing government and religion, but to protect religion from
a corrupting dependence on support from the Government.

effect of government support does not turn on whether theGovernment's own money comes from taxation or gift or the
sale of public lands, the Establishment Clause could hardlyrelax its vigilance simply because tax revenue was not implicated. Accordingly, in the absence of a forthright disavowal,one can only assume that the Court does not mean to eliminate one half of the Establishment Clause's justification.

II
Given the dispositive effect of the Establishment Clause'sbar to funding the magazine, there should be no need to decide whether in the absence of this bar the University wouldviolate the Free Speech Clause by limiting funding as it has
done. Widmar, 454 U. S., at 271 (university's compliancewith its Establishment Clause obligations can be a compelling interest justifying speech restriction). But the Court'sspeech analysis may have independent application, and its
flaws should not pass unremarked.The Court acknowledges, ante, at 832, the necessity for a
university to make judgments based on the content of whatmay be said or taught when it decides, in the absence of
unlimited amounts of money or other resources, how to honorits educational responsibilities.

Widmar, supra, at 276; cf.Perry, 460 U. S., at 49 (subject matter and speaker identity

distinctions "are inherent and inescapable in the process oflimiting a nonpublic forum to activities compatible with the
intended purpose of the property"). Nor does the Courtgenerally question that in allocating public funds a state university enjoys spacious discretion. Cf. Rust v. Sullivan, 500U. S. 173, 194 (1991) ("[W]hen the government appropriates
public funds to establish a program it is entitled to define thelimits of that program");

Regan v. Taxation with Represen-tation of Wash., 461 U. S. 540 (1983) (upholding government

subsidization decision partial to one class of speaker).11 Ac11 The Court draws a distinction between a State's use of public funds
to advance its own speech and the State's funding of private speech, suggesting that authority to make content-related choices is at its most powerful when the State undertakes the former. Ante, at 833-835. I would
not argue otherwise, see Hazelwood School Dist. v. Kuhlmeier, 484 U. S.
260, 270-273 (1988), but I do suggest that this case reveals the difficulties
that can be encountered in drawing this distinction. There is a communi515us3$91M 08-18-98 10:04:59 PAGES OPINPGT

cordingly, the Court recognizes that the relevant enquiry inthis case is not merely whether the University bases its funding decisions on the subject matter of student speech; if thereis an infirmity in the basis for the University's funding decision, it must be that the University is impermissibly distinguishing among competing viewpoints, ante, at 829-830, cit-ing,

inter alia, Perry, supra, at 46; see also Lamb's Chapel,
508 U. S., at 392-393 (subject-matter distinctions permissible
in controlling access to limited public forum if reasonable and
viewpoint neutral); Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense &
Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U. S. 788, 806 (1985) (similar); Regan,
supra, at 548.12

The issue whether a distinction is based on viewpoint does
not turn simply on whether a government regulation happens to be applied to a speaker who seeks to advance a particular viewpoint; the issue, of course, turns on whether the
burden on speech is explained by reference to viewpoint.
See Cornelius, supra, at 806 ("[T]he government violates the
First Amendment when it denies access to a speaker solely

cative element inherent in the very act of funding itself, cf. Buckley v.
Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 15-19 (1976) (per curiam), and although it is the student
speakers who choose which particular messages to advance in the forum
created by the University, the initial act of defining the boundaries of the
forum is a decision attributable to the University, not the students. In
any event, even assuming that private and state speech always may be
separated by clean lines and that this case involves only the former, I
believe the distinction is irrelevant here because, as is discussed infra,
this case does not involve viewpoint discrimination.

12 I do not decide that all viewpoint discrimination in a public university's funding determinations would violate the Free Speech Clause. If,
however, the determinations are made on the basis of a reasonable
subject-matter distinction, but not on a viewpoint distinction, there is no
violation. In a limited-access forum, a speech restriction must be " `reasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum' " as well as viewpoint
neutral. E. g., Lamb's Chapel, 508 U. S., at 392-393, quoting Cornelius,
473 U. S., at 806. Because petitioners have not challenged the University's Guideline as unreasonable, I express no opinion on that or on the
question whether the reasonableness criterion applies in speech funding
cases in the same manner that it applies in limited-access forum cases.

to suppress the point of view he espouses on an otherwiseincludible subject"). As when deciding whether a speech restriction is content based or content neutral, "[t]he govern-ment's purpose is the controlling consideration."

Ward v.
Rock Against Racism, 491 U. S. 781, 791 (1989); see also ibid.
(content neutrality turns on, inter alia, whether a speechrestriction is "justified without reference to the content of

the regulated speech") (internal quotation marks and cita-tions omitted) (emphasis deleted). So, for example, a city
that enforces its excessive noise ordinance by pulling theplug on a rock band using a forbidden amplification system
is not guilty of viewpoint discrimination simply because the
band wishes to use that equipment to espouse antiracist
views. Accord, Rock Against Racism, supra. Nor does a
municipality's decision to prohibit political advertising on bus
placards amount to viewpoint discrimination when in the
course of applying this policy it denies space to a person who
wishes to speak in favor of a particular political candidate.
Accord, Lehman v. Shaker Heights, 418 U. S. 298, 304 (1974)
(plurality opinion).

Accordingly, the prohibition on viewpoint discrimination
serves that important purpose of the Free Speech Clause,
which is to bar the government from skewing public debate.
Other things being equal, viewpoint discrimination occurs
when government allows one message while prohibiting the
messages of those who can reasonably be expected to respond. See First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U. S.
765, 785-786 (1978) ("Especially where . . . the legislature's
suppression of speech suggests an attempt to give one side
of a debatable public question an advantage in expressing its
views to the people, the First Amendment is plainly offended") (footnote omitted); Madison Joint School Dist. No.

United States v. Kokinda, 497 U. S. 720, 736 (1990) (viewpointdiscrimination involves an "inten[t] to discourage one viewpoint and advance another") (plurality opinion) (citations andinternal quotation marks omitted). It is precisely this element of taking sides in a public debate that identifies viewpoint discrimination and makes it the most pernicious of alldistinctions based on content. Thus, if government assists

those espousing one point of view, neutrality requires it toassist those espousing opposing points of view, as well.

There is no viewpoint discrimination in the University'sapplication of its Guidelines to deny funding to Wide Awake.
Under those Guidelines, a "religious activit[y]," which is not
eligible for funding, App. to Pet. for Cert. 62a, is "an activity
which primarily promotes or manifests a particular belief(s)
in or about a deity or an ultimate reality," id., at 66a. It is
clear that this is the basis on which Wide Awake Productions
was denied funding. Letter from Student Council to Ronald
W. Rosenberger, App. 54 ("In reviewing the request by Wide
Awake Productions, the Appropriations Committee determined your organization's request could not be funded as it
is a religious activity"). The discussion of Wide Awake's
content, supra, at 865-868, shows beyond any question that
it "primarily promotes or manifests a particular belief(s) in
or about a deity . . . ," in the very specific sense that its
manifest function is to call students to repentance, to commitment to Jesus Christ, and to particular moral action because of its Christian character.

If the Guidelines were written or applied so as to limit
only such Christian advocacy and no other evangelical efforts
that might compete with it, the discrimination would be
based on viewpoint. But that is not what the regulation
authorizes; it applies to Muslim and Jewish and Buddhist advocacy as well as to Christian. And since it limits funding
to activities promoting or manifesting a particular belief not
only "in" but "about" a deity or ultimate reality, it applies to
agnostics and atheists as well as it does to deists and theists

(as the University maintained at oral argument, Tr. of OralArg. 18-19, and as the Court recognizes, see

ante, at 836-
837). The Guidelines, and their application to Wide Awake,thus do not skew debate by funding one position but not

its competitors. As understood by their application to Wide
Awake, they simply deny funding for hortatory speech that"primarily promotes or manifests" any view on the merits of

religion; they deny funding for the entire subject matter ofreligious apologetics.

The Court, of course, reads the Guidelines differently, butwhile I believe the Court is wrong in construing their
breadth, the important point is that even on the Court's ownconstruction the Guidelines impose no viewpoint discrimination. In attempting to demonstrate the potentially chilling
effect such funding restrictions might have on learning inour Nation's universities, the Court describes the Guidelines

as "a sweeping restriction on student thought and studentinquiry," disentitling a vast array of topics to funding.

Ante,
at 836. As the Court reads the Guidelines to exclude "anywriting that is explicable as resting upon a premise which

presupposes the existence of a deity or ultimate reality,"
ibid., as well as "those student journalistic efforts which primarily manifest or promote a belief that there is no deity
and no ultimate reality," the Court concludes that the major
works of writers from Descartes to Sartre would be barred
from the funding forum, ante, at 837. The Court goes so
far as to suggest that the Guidelines, properly interpreted,
tolerate nothing much more than essays on "making pasta or
peanut butter cookies." Ibid.

Now, the regulation is not so categorically broad as the
Court protests. The Court reads the word "primarily"
("primarily promotes or manifests a particular belief(s) in or
about a deity or an ultimate reality") right out of the Guidelines, whereas it is obviously crucial in distinguishing between works characterized by the evangelism of Wide
Awake and writing that merely happens to express views
that a given religion might approve, or simply descriptive

writing informing a reader about the position of a given reli-gion. But, as I said, that is not the important point. Even

if the Court were indeed correct about the funding restric-tion's categorical breadth, the stringency of the restriction
would most certainly not work any impermissible viewpointdiscrimination under any prior understanding of that species
of content discrimination. If a university wished to fundno speech beyond the subjects of pasta and cookie preparation, it surely would not be discriminating on the basis ofsomeone's viewpoint, at least absent some controversial
claim that pasta and cookies did not exist. The upshotwould be an instructional universe without higher education,
but not a universe where one viewpoint was enriched aboveits competitors.

The Guidelines are thus substantially different from theaccess restriction considered in Lamb's Chapel, the case
upon which the Court heavily relies in finding a view-point distinction here, ante, at 830-832. Lamb's Chapel
addressed a school board's regulation prohibiting the after-hours use of school premises "by any group for religious purposes," even though the forum otherwise was open for a vari-ety of social, civic, and recreational purposes. 508 U. S., at
387 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). "Reli-gious" was understood to refer to the viewpoint of a believer,
and the regulation did not purport to deny access to anyspeaker wishing to express a nonreligious or expressly antireligious point of view on any subject, see ibid. ("The issuein this case is whether . . . it violates the Free Speech Clause
of the First Amendment . . . to deny a church access to schoolpremises to exhibit for public viewing and for assertedly
religious purposes, a film series dealing with family andchild-rearing issues"); id., at 394, citing May v. EvansvilleVanderburgh School Corp., 787 F. 2d 1105, 1114 (CA7 1986).13

13 See also Tr. of Oral Arg. in Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union

district charged with enforcing the restriction unequivocally admitted that

With this understanding, it was unremarkable that inLamb's Chapel we unanimously determined that the access

restriction, as applied to a speaker wishing to discuss familyvalues from a Christian perspective, impermissibly distinguished between speakers on the basis of viewpoint. See
Lamb's Chapel, supra, at 393-394 (considering as-appliedchallenge only). Equally obvious is the distinction between

that case and this one, where the regulation is being applied,not to deny funding for those who discuss issues in general
from a religious viewpoint, but to those engaged in promot-ing or opposing religious conversion and religious observances as such. If this amounts to viewpoint discrimination,the Court has all but eviscerated the line between viewpoint
and content.To put the point another way, the Court's decision equating a categorical exclusion of both sides of the religious de-bate with viewpoint discrimination suggests the Court has
concluded that primarily religious and antireligious speech,grouped together, always provides an opposing (and not
merely a related) viewpoint to any speech about any seculartopic. Thus, the Court's reasoning requires a university
that funds private publications about any primarily nonreliuse school property under the rules of the forum. Id., at 47, 57-58. The
complete exchange during the oral argument in Lamb's Chapel went as
follows:

"QUESTION: But do I understand your statement you made earlier
that supposing you had a communist group that wanted to address the
subject of family values and they thought there was a value in not having
children waste their time going to Sunday school or church and therefore
they had a point of view that was definitely antireligious, they would be
permitted, under your policy, to discuss family values in that context?

"[COUNSEL]: Yes. Yes, Your Honor, that's correct.. . . . .

"QUESTION: Counsel, in your earlier discussions with [the Court] you
indicated that communists would be able to give their perspective on family. I--I assume from that that atheists would be able to give theirs
under your rules.

"[COUNSEL]: Yes, Your Honor."

gious topic also to fund publications primarily espousingadherence to or rejection of religion. But a university's

decision to fund a magazine about racism, and not to fundpublications aimed at urging repentance before God does not
skew the debate either about racism or the desirability ofreligious conversion. The Court's contrary holding amounts
to a significant reformulation of our viewpoint discriminationprecedents and will significantly expand access to limitedaccess forums. See Greer v. Spock, 424 U. S. 828 (1976) (up-holding regulation prohibiting political speeches on military
base); Cornelius, 473 U. S., at 812 (exclusion from fundraisingdrive of political activity or advocacy groups is facially viewpoint neutral despite inclusion of charitable, health, and wel-fare agencies); Perry, 460 U. S., at 49-50, and n. 9 (ability of
teachers' bargaining representative to use internal schoolmail system does not require that access be provided to "any
other citizen's group or community organization with a mes-sage for school personnel"); Lehman, 418 U. S., at 304 (plurality opinion) (exclusion of political messages from forumpermissible despite ability of nonpolitical speakers to use
the forum). III

Since I cannot see the future I cannot tell whether today'sdecision portends much more than making a shambles out of
student activity fees in public colleges. Still, my apprehen-sion is whetted by Chief Justice Burger's warning in

Lemonv. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602, 624 (1971): "in constitutional adjudication some steps, which when taken were thought toapproach `the verge,' have become the platform for yet further steps. A certain momentum develops in constitutionaltheory and it can be a `downhill thrust' easily set in motion
but difficult to retard or stop."I respectfully dissent.

MILLER et al. v. JOHNSON et al.
appeal from the united states district court for thesouthern district of georgia

No. 94-631. Argued April 19, 1995--Decided June 29, 1995*
In Shaw v. Reno, 509 U. S. 630, this Court articulated the equal protection

principles that govern a State's drawing of congressional districts, noting that laws that explicitly distinguish between individuals on racial
grounds fall within the core of the Equal Protection Clause's prohibition
against race-based decisionmaking, that this prohibition extends to laws
neutral on their face but unexplainable on grounds other than race, and
that redistricting legislation that is so bizarre on its face that it is unexplainable on grounds other than race demands the same strict scrutiny
given to other state laws that classify citizens by race. Georgia's most
recent congressional districting plan contains three majority-black districts and was adopted after the Justice Department refused to preclear,
under $ 5 of the Voting Rights Act (Act), two earlier plans that each
contained only two majority-black districts. Appellees, voters in the
new Eleventh District--which joins metropolitan black neighborhoods
together with the poor black populace of coastal areas 260 miles away--
challenged the district on the ground that it was a racial gerrymander
in violation of the Equal Protection Clause as interpreted in Shaw. The
District Court agreed, holding that evidence of the state legislature's
purpose, as well as the district's irregular borders, showed that race
was the overriding and predominant force in the districting determination. The court assumed that compliance with the Act would be a compelling interest, but found that the plan was not narrowly tailored to
meet that interest since the Act did not require three majority-black
districts.

Held: Georgia's congressional redistricting plan violates the Equal Protection Clause. Pp. 910-928.

(a) Parties alleging that a State has assigned voters on the basis of
race are neither confined in their proof to evidence regarding a district's
geometry and makeup nor required to make a threshold showing of
bizarreness. A district's shape is relevant to Shaw's equal protection
analysis not because bizarreness is a necessary element of the constitu*Together with No. 94-797, Abrams et al. v. Johnson et al., and No.

court.

tional wrong or a threshold requirement of proof, but because it may be
persuasive circumstantial evidence that race for its own sake, and not
other districting principles, was a legislature's dominant and controlling
rationale in drawing district lines. In some exceptional cases, a reapportionment plan may be so highly irregular that, on its face, it rationally cannot be understood as anything other than an effort to segregate
voters based on race, but where the district is not so bizarre, parties
may rely on other evidence to establish race-based districting. The
very stereotypical assumptions the Equal Protection Clause forbids underlie the argument that the Clause's general proscription on race-based
decisionmaking does not obtain in the districting context because redistricting involves racial consideration. While redistricting usually implicates a political calculus in which various interests compete for recognition, it does not follow that individuals of the same race share a single
political interest. Nor can the analysis used to assess the vote dilution
claim in United Jewish Organizations of Williamsburgh, Inc. v. Carey,
430 U. S. 144, be applied to resuscitate this argument. Pp. 910-915.

(b) Courts must exercise extraordinary caution in adjudicating claims
that a State has drawn race-based district lines. The plaintiff must
show, whether through circumstantial evidence of a district's shape and
demographics or more direct evidence of legislative purpose, that race
was the predominant factor motivating the legislature's decision to place
a significant number of voters within or without a district. To make
this showing, a plaintiff must prove that the legislature subordinated
traditional race-neutral districting principles, including but not limited
to compactness, contiguity, respect for political subdivisions or communities defined by actual shared interests, to racial considerations.
Pp. 915-917.

(c) The District Court applied the correct analysis here, and its finding that race was the predominant factor motivating the Eleventh
District's drawing was not clearly erroneous. It need not be decided
whether the district's shape, standing alone, was sufficient to establish
that the district is unexplainable on grounds other than race, for there
is considerable additional evidence showing that the state legislature
was motivated by a predominant, overriding desire to create a third
majority-black district in order to comply with the Justice Department's
preclearance demands. The District Court's well-supported finding
justified its rejection of the various alternative explanations offered for
the district. Appellants cannot refute the claim of racial gerrymandering by arguing the legislature complied with traditional districting principles, since those factors were subordinated to racial objectives. Nor
are there tangible communities of interest spanning the district's hundreds of miles that can be called upon to rescue the plan. Since race

was the predominant, overriding factor behind the Eleventh District's
drawing, the State's plan is subject to strict scrutiny and can be sustained only if it is narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling state
interest. Pp. 917-920.

(d) While there is a significant state interest in eradicating the effects
of past racial discrimination, there is little doubt that Georgia's true
interest was to satisfy the Justice Department's preclearance demands.
Even if compliance with the Act, standing alone, could provide a compelling interest, it cannot do so here, where the district was not reasonably
necessary under a constitutional reading and application of the Act. To
say that the plan was required in order to obtain preclearance is not to
say that it was required by the Act's substantive requirements. Georgia's two earlier plans were ameliorative and could not have violated $ 5
unless they so discriminated on the basis of race or color as to violate
the Constitution. However, instead of grounding its objections on evidence of a discriminatory purpose, the Justice Department appears to
have been driven by its maximization policy. In utilizing $ 5 to require
States to create majority-minority districts whenever possible, the Department expanded its statutory authority beyond Congress' intent for

$ 5: to insure that no voting-procedure changes would be made that
would lead to a retrogression in the position of racial minorities with
respect to their effective exercise of the electoral franchise. The policy
also raises serious constitutional concerns because its implicit command
that States may engage in presumptive unconstitutional race-based districting brings the Act, once upheld as a proper exercise of Congress'
Fifteenth Amendment authority, into tension with the Fourteenth
Amendment. Pp. 920-927.

Opinion of the Court
nounced in Shaw, and, if so, whether it can be sustained
nonetheless as narrowly tailored to serve a compelling
governmental interest.

I

A

The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides that no State shall "deny to any person within
its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws." U. S.
Const., Amdt. 14, $ 1. Its central mandate is racial neutrality in governmental decisionmaking. See, e. g., Loving v.
Virginia, 388 U. S. 1, 11 (1967); McLaughlin v. Florida, 379
U. S. 184, 191-192 (1964); see also Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954). Though application of this imperative raises difficult questions, the basic principle is straightforward: "Racial and ethnic distinctions of any sort are
inherently suspect and thus call for the most exacting judicial examination. . . . This perception of racial and ethnic
distinctions is rooted in our Nation's constitutional and demographic history." Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438
U. S. 265, 291 (1978) (opinion of Powell, J.). This rule obtains
with equal force regardless of "the race of those burdened
or benefited by a particular classification." Richmond v.

J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469, 494 (1989) (plurality opinion)
(citations omitted); id., at 520 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) ("I agree . . . with Justice O'Connor's conclusion that
strict scrutiny must be applied to all governmental classification by race"); see also Adarand Constructors, Inc. v.
Pen~ a, ante, at 224; Bakke, supra, at 289-291 (opinion of Powell, J.). Laws classifying citizens on the basis of race cannot
be upheld unless they are narrowly tailored to achieving a
compelling state interest. See, e. g., Adarand, ante, at 227;
Croson, supra, at 494 (plurality opinion); Wygant v. Jackson
Bd. of Ed., 476 U. S. 267, 274, 280, and n. 6 (1986) (plurality
opinion).

Opinion of the Court
In Shaw v. Reno, supra, we recognized that these equalprotection principles govern a State's drawing of congressional districts, though, as our cautious approach there dis-closes, application of these principles to electoral districting
is a most delicate task. Our analysis began from the prem-ise that "[l]aws that explicitly distinguish between individuals on racial grounds fall within the core of [the Equal Pro-tection Clause's] prohibition."

Id., at 642. This prohibitionextends not just to explicit racial classifications, but also to

laws neutral on their face but " `unexplainable on groundsother than race.' " Id., at 644 (quoting Arlington Heights v.
Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429 U. S. 252, 266(1977)). Applying this basic equal protection analysis in the
voting rights context, we held that "redistricting legislationthat is so bizarre on its face that it is `unexplainable on
grounds other than race,' . . . demands the same close scru-tiny that we give other state laws that classify citizens by
race." 509 U. S., at 644 (quoting Arlington Heights, supra,at 266).

This litigation requires us to apply the principles articu-lated in Shaw to the most recent congressional redistricting
plan enacted by the State of Georgia.

B
In 1965, the Attorney General designated Georgia a cov-ered jurisdiction under $ 4(b) of the Voting Rights Act (Act),

79 Stat. 438, as amended, 42 U. S. C. $ 1973b(b). 30 Fed.Reg. 9897 (1965); see 28 CFR pt. 51, App.; see also

City ofRome v. United States, 446 U. S. 156, 161 (1980). In consequence, $ 5 of the Act requires Georgia to obtain either ad-ministrative preclearance by the Attorney General or approval by the United States District Court for the District
of Columbia of any change in a "standard, practice, or proce-dure with respect to voting" made after November 1, 1964.

42 U. S. C. $ 1973c. The preclearance mechanism applies to

Opinion of the Court
congressional redistricting plans, see, e. g., Beer v. United
States, 425 U. S. 130, 133 (1976), and requires that the proposed change "not have the purpose and will not have theeffect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account

of race or color." 42 U. S. C. $ 1973c. "[T]he purpose of $ 5
has always been to insure that no voting-procedure changeswould be made that would lead to a retrogression in the

position of racial minorities with respect to their effectiveexercise of the electoral franchise."

Beer, supra, at 141.
Between 1980 and 1990, one of Georgia's 10 congressionaldistricts was a majority-black district, that is, a majority of

the district's voters were black. The 1990 Decennial Census
indicated that Georgia's population of 6,478,216 persons, 27%
of whom are black, entitled it to an additional eleventh congressional seat, App. 9, prompting Georgia's General Assembly to redraw the State's congressional districts. Both the
House and the Senate adopted redistricting guidelines
which, among other things, required single-member districts
of equal population, contiguous geography, nondilution of minority voting strength, fidelity to precinct lines where possible, and compliance with $$ 2 and 5 of the Act, 42 U. S. C.

$$ 1973, 1973c. See App. 11-12. Only after these requirements were met did the guidelines permit drafters to consider other ends, such as maintaining the integrity of political subdivisions, preserving the core of existing districts, and
avoiding contests between incumbents. Id., at 12.

A special session opened in August 1991, and the General
Assembly submitted a congressional redistricting plan to the
Attorney General for preclearance on October 1, 1991. The
legislature's plan contained two majority-minority districts,
the Fifth and Eleventh, and an additional district, the Second, in which blacks comprised just over 35% of the voting
age population. Despite the plan's increase in the number
of majority-black districts from one to two and the absence
of any evidence of an intent to discriminate against minority
voters, 864 F. Supp. 1354, 1363, and n. 7 (SD Ga. 1994), the

Opinion of the Court
Department of Justice refused preclearance on January 21,1992. App. 99-107. The Department's objection letter

noted a concern that Georgia had created only two majority-minority districts, and that the proposed plan did not "recognize" certain minority populations by placing them in a
majority-black district. Id., at 105, 105-106.The General Assembly returned to the drawing board. A

new plan was enacted and submitted for preclearance. Thissecond attempt assigned the black population in Central
Georgia's Baldwin County to the Eleventh District and in-creased the black populations in the Eleventh, Fifth, and
Second Districts. The Justice Department refused preclearance again, relying on alternative plans proposing three
majority-minority districts. Id., at 120-126. One of the
alternative schemes relied on by the Department was the
so-called "max-black" plan, 864 F. Supp., at 1360, 1362-1363,
drafted by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) for
the General Assembly's black caucus. The key to the
ACLU's plan was the "Macon/Savannah trade." The dense
black population in the Macon region would be transferred
from the Eleventh District to the Second, converting the
Second into a majority-black district, and the Eleventh District's loss in black population would be offset by extending
the Eleventh to include the black populations in Savannah.
Id., at 1365-1366. Pointing to the General Assembly's refusal to enact the Macon/Savannah swap into law, the Justice
Department concluded that Georgia had "failed to explain
adequately" its failure to create a third majority-minority
district. App. 125. The State did not seek a declaratory
judgment from the District Court for the District of Columbia. 864 F. Supp., at 1366, n. 11.

Twice spurned, the General Assembly set out to create
three majority-minority districts to gain preclearance. Id.,
at 1366. Using the ACLU's "max-black" plan as its benchmark, id., at 1366-1367, the General Assembly enacted a
plan that

908 MILLER v. JOHNSON

Opinion of the Court
"bore all the signs of [the Justice Department's] involve-ment: The black population of Meriwether County was

gouged out of the Third District and attached to theSecond District by the narrowest of land bridges; Effingham and Chatham Counties were split to make wayfor the Savannah extension, which itself split the City of
Savannah; and the plan as a whole split 26 counties, 23more than the existing congressional districts."

Id., at1367.

See Appendix A, infra, following p. 928. The new plan alsoenacted the Macon/Savannah swap necessary to create a
third majority-black district. The Eleventh District lost theblack population of Macon, but picked up Savannah, thereby
connecting the black neighborhoods of metropolitan Atlantaand the poor black populace of coastal Chatham County,
though 260 miles apart in distance and worlds apart in cul-ture. In short, the social, political, and economic makeup of
the Eleventh District tells a tale of disparity, not community.See 864 F. Supp., at 1376-1377, 1389-1390; Plaintiff 's Exh.
No. 85, pp. 10-27 (report of Timothy G. O'Rourke, Ph.D.).As the appendices to this opinion attest,

"[t]he populations of the Eleventh are centered aroundfour discrete, widely spaced urban centers that have absolutely nothing to do with each other, and stretch thedistrict hundreds of miles across rural counties and narrow swamp corridors." 864 F. Supp., at 1389 (footnote
omitted).

"The dense population centers of the approved Eleventh
District were all majority-black, all at the periphery of
the district, and in the case of Atlanta, Augusta andSavannah, all tied to a sparsely populated rural core by

even less populated land bridges. Extending fromAtlanta to the Atlantic, the Eleventh covered 6,784.2
square miles, splitting eight counties and five municipali-ties along the way."

Id., at 1367 (footnote omitted).

Opinion of the Court
The Almanac of American Politics has this to say aboutthe Eleventh District: "Geographically, it is a monstrosity,

stretching from Atlanta to Savannah. Its core is the plan-tation country in the center of the state, lightly populated,
but heavily black. It links by narrow corridors the black
neighborhoods in Augusta, Savannah and southern DeKalbCounty." M. Barone & G. Ujifusa, Almanac of American

Politics 356 (1994). Georgia's plan included three majority-black districts, though, and received Justice Department
preclearance on April 2, 1992. Plaintiff 's Exh. No. 6; see864 F. Supp., at 1367.

Elections were held under the new congressional redistricting plan on November 4, 1992, and black candidates were
elected to Congress from all three majority-black districts.
Id., at 1369. On January 13, 1994, appellees, five white voters from the Eleventh District, filed this action against various state officials (Miller Appellants) in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of Georgia. Id., at
1369, 1370. As residents of the challenged Eleventh District, all appellees had standing. See United States v. Hays,
ante, at 744-745. Their suit alleged that Georgia's Eleventh
District was a racial gerrymander and so a violation of the
Equal Protection Clause as interpreted in Shaw v. Reno. A
three-judge court was convened pursuant to 28 U. S. C.

$ 2284, and the United States and a number of Georgia residents intervened in support of the defendant-state officials.

A majority of the District Court panel agreed that the
Eleventh District was invalid under Shaw, with one judge
dissenting. 864 F. Supp. 1354 (1994). After sharp criticism of the Justice Department for its use of partisan advocates in its dealings with state officials and for its close cooperation with the ACLU's vigorous advocacy of minority
district maximization, the majority turned to a careful interpretation of our opinion in Shaw. It read Shaw to require
strict scrutiny whenever race is the "overriding, predominant force" in the redistricting process. 864 F. Supp., at

Opinion of the Court
1372 (emphasis deleted). Citing much evidence of the legis-lature's purpose and intent in creating the final plan, as well

as the irregular shape of the district (in particular severalappendages drawn for the obvious purpose of putting black
populations into the district), the court found that race wasthe overriding and predominant force in the districting determination. Id., at 1378. The court proceeded to applystrict scrutiny. Though rejecting proportional representation as a compelling interest, it was willing to assume thatcompliance with the Act would be a compelling interest.
Id., at 1381-1382. As to the latter, however, the court foundthat the Act did not require three majority-black districts,
and that Georgia's plan for that reason was not narrowlytailored to the goal of complying with the Act. Id., at
1392-1393.Appellants filed notices of appeal and requested a stay of
the District Court's judgment, which we granted pending thefiling and disposition of the appeals in this litigation, Miller
v. Johnson, 512 U. S. 1283 (1994). We later noted probablejurisdiction. 513 U. S. 1071 (1995); see 28 U. S. C. $ 1253.

II

A

Finding that the "evidence of the General Assembly'sintent to racially gerrymander the Eleventh District is

overwhelming, and practically stipulated by the partiesinvolved," the District Court held that race was the
predominant, overriding factor in drawing the Eleventh Dis-trict. 864 F. Supp., at 1374; see id., at 1374-1378. Appellants do not take issue with the court's factual finding of thisracial motivation. Rather, they contend that evidence of a
legislature's deliberate classification of voters on the basis ofrace cannot alone suffice to state a claim under

Shaw. Theyargue that, regardless of the legislature's purposes, a plaintiff must demonstrate that a district's shape is so bizarre thatit is unexplainable other than on the basis of race, and that

Opinion of the Court
appellees failed to make that showing here. Appellants'conception of the constitutional violation misapprehends our

holding in Shaw and the equal protection precedent uponwhich

Shaw relied.
Shaw recognized a claim "analytically distinct" from a
vote dilution claim. 509 U. S., at 652; see id., at 649-650.Whereas a vote dilution claim alleges that the State has

enacted a particular voting scheme as a purposeful device"to minimize or cancel out the voting potential of racial or
ethnic minorities," Mobile v. Bolden, 446 U. S. 55, 66 (1980)(citing cases), an action disadvantaging voters of a particular
race, the essence of the equal protection claim recognized in
Shaw is that the State has used race as a basis for separating
voters into districts. Just as the State may not, absent
extraordinary justification, segregate citizens on the basis of
race in its public parks, New Orleans City Park Improvement Assn. v. Detiege, 358 U. S. 54 (1958) (per curiam),
buses, Gayle v. Browder, 352 U. S. 903 (1956) (per curiam),
golf courses, Holmes v. Atlanta, 350 U. S. 879 (1955) (per
curiam), beaches, Mayor of Baltimore v. Dawson, 350 U. S.
877 (1955) (per curiam), and schools, Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954), so did we recognize in Shaw
that it may not separate its citizens into different voting districts on the basis of race. The idea is a simple one: "At the
heart of the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection lies
the simple command that the Government must treat citizens
`as individuals, not "as simply components of a racial, religious, sexual or national class." ' " Metro Broadcasting, Inc.
v. FCC, 497 U. S. 547, 602 (1990) (O'Connor, J., dissenting)
(quoting Arizona Governing Comm. for Tax Deferred Annuity and Deferred Compensation Plans v. Norris, 463 U. S.
1073, 1083 (1983)); cf. Northeastern Fla. Chapter, Associated
Gen. Contractors of America v. Jacksonville, 508 U. S. 656,
666 (1993) (" `injury in fact' " was "denial of equal treatment
. . . , not the ultimate inability to obtain the benefit"). When
the State assigns voters on the basis of race, it engages in

515us3$92l 09-10-98 09:40:04 PAGES OPINPGT
912 MILLER v. JOHNSON

Opinion of the Court
the offensive and demeaning assumption that voters of a par-ticular race, because of their race, "think alike, share the

same political interests, and will prefer the same candidatesat the polls."

Shaw, supra, at 647; see Metro Broadcasting,
supra, at 636 (Kennedy, J., dissenting). Race-based assignments "embody stereotypes that treat individuals as theproduct of their race, evaluating their thoughts and efforts--

their very worth as citizens--according to a criterion barredto the Government by history and the Constitution."

Metro
Broadcasting, supra, at 604 (O'Connor, J., dissenting) (cita-tion omitted); see

Powers v. Ohio, 499 U. S. 400, 410 (1991)
("Race cannot be a proxy for determining juror bias orcompetence");

Palmore v. Sidoti, 466 U. S. 429, 432 (1984)
("Classifying persons according to their race is more likely
to reflect racial prejudice than legitimate public concerns;the race, not the person, dictates the category"). They

also cause society serious harm. As we concluded in Shaw:

"Racial classifications with respect to voting carry particular dangers. Racial gerrymandering, even for re-medial purposes, may balkanize us into competing racial

factions; it threatens to carry us further from the goalof a political system in which race no longer matters--
a goal that the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendmentsembody, and to which the Nation continues to aspire.
It is for these reasons that race-based districting byour state legislatures demands close judicial scrutiny."
Shaw, supra, at 657.
Our observation in Shaw of the consequences of racial stereotyping was not meant to suggest that a district must be
bizarre on its face before there is a constitutional violation.
Nor was our conclusion in Shaw that in certain instances a
district's appearance (or, to be more precise, its appearance
in combination with certain demographic evidence) can give
rise to an equal protection claim, 509 U. S., at 649, a holding
that bizarreness was a threshold showing, as appellants be515us3$92l 09-10-98 09:40:04 PAGES OPINPGT

913Cite as: 515 U. S. 900 (1995)
Opinion of the Court
lieve it to be. Our circumspect approach and narrow holdingin

Shaw did not erect an artificial rule barring accepted
equal protection analysis in other redistricting cases.Shape is relevant not because bizarreness is a necessary element of the constitutional wrong or a threshold requirement
of proof, but because it may be persuasive circumstantial evi-dence that race for its own sake, and not other districting

principles, was the legislature's dominant and controlling ra-tionale in drawing its district lines. The logical implication,
as courts applying Shaw have recognized, is that parties mayrely on evidence other than bizarreness to establish racebased districting. See Shaw v. Hunt, 861 F. Supp. 408, 431
(EDNC 1994); Hays v. Louisiana, 839 F. Supp. 1188, 1195
(WD La. 1993), vacated, 512 U. S. 1230 (1994); but see DeWitt
v. Wilson, 856 F. Supp. 1409, 1413 (ED Cal. 1994).

Our reasoning in Shaw compels this conclusion. We
recognized in Shaw that, outside the districting context,
statutes are subject to strict scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause not just when they contain express racial
classifications, but also when, though race neutral on their
face, they are motivated by a racial purpose or object. 509
U. S., at 644. In the rare case, where the effect of government action is a pattern " `unexplainable on grounds other
than race,' " ibid. (quoting Arlington Heights, 429 U. S., at
266), "[t]he evidentiary inquiry is . . . relatively easy," Arlington Heights, supra, at 266 (footnote omitted). As early as
Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U. S. 356 (1886), the Court recognized that a laundry permit ordinance was administered in a
deliberate way to exclude all Chinese from the laundry business; and in Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U. S. 339 (1960), the
Court concluded that the redrawing of Tuskegee, Alabama's
municipal boundaries left no doubt that the plan was designed to exclude blacks. Even in those cases, however, it
was the presumed racial purpose of state action, not its stark
manifestation, that was the constitutional violation. Patterns of discrimination as conspicuous as these are rare, and

Opinion of the Court
are not a necessary predicate to a violation of the Equal Pro-tection Clause. Cf.

Arlington Heights, supra, at 266, n. 14.
In the absence of a pattern as stark as those in Yick Wo or
Gomillion, "impact alone is not determinative, and the Court
must look to other evidence" of race-based decisionmaking.
Arlington Heights, supra, at 266 (footnotes omitted).

Shaw applied these same principles to redistricting. "In
some exceptional cases, a reapportionment plan may be sohighly irregular that, on its face, it rationally cannot be understood as anything other than an effort to `segregat[e] . . .voters' on the basis of race."

Shaw, supra, at 646-647 (quoting Gomillion, supra, at 341). In other cases, where the
district is not so bizarre on its face that it discloses a racial
design, the proof will be more "difficul[t]." 509 U. S., at 646.
Although it was not necessary in Shaw to consider further
the proof required in these more difficult cases, the logical
import of our reasoning is that evidence other than a district's bizarre shape can be used to support the claim.

Appellants and some of their amici argue that the Equal
Protection Clause's general proscription on race-based decisionmaking does not obtain in the districting context because
redistricting by definition involves racial considerations.
Underlying their argument are the very stereotypical assumptions the Equal Protection Clause forbids. It is true
that redistricting in most cases will implicate a political calculus in which various interests compete for recognition, but
it does not follow from this that individuals of the same race
share a single political interest. The view that they do is
"based on the demeaning notion that members of the defined
racial groups ascribe to certain `minority views' that must
be different from those of other citizens," Metro Broadcasting, 497 U. S., at 636 (Kennedy, J., dissenting), the precise
use of race as a proxy the Constitution prohibits. Nor can
the argument that districting cases are excepted from standard equal protection precepts be resuscitated by United Jewish Organizations of Williamsburgh, Inc. v. Carey, 430 U. S.

Opinion of the Court
144 (1977), where the Court addressed a claim that New Yorkviolated the Constitution by splitting a Hasidic Jewish community in order to include additional majority-minority dis-tricts. As we explained in Shaw, a majority of the Justices
in UJO construed the complaint as stating a vote dilutionclaim, so their analysis does not apply to a claim that the
State has separated voters on the basis of race. 509 U. S.,at 652. To the extent any of the opinions in that "highly
fractured decision," id., at 651, can be interpreted as sug-gesting that a State's assignment of voters on the basis of
race would be subject to anything but our strictest scrutiny,those views ought not be deemed controlling.

In sum, we make clear that parties alleging that a Statehas assigned voters on the basis of race are neither confined
in their proof to evidence regarding the district's geometryand makeup nor required to make a threshold showing of
bizarreness. Today's litigation requires us further to con-sider the requirements of the proof necessary to sustain this
equal protection challenge. B

Federal-court review of districting legislation representsa serious intrusion on the most vital of local functions. It
is well settled that "reapportionment is primarily the dutyand responsibility of the State."

Chapman v. Meier, 420U. S. 1, 27 (1975); see, e. g., Voinovich v. Quilter, 507 U. S.

146, 156-157 (1993); Growe v. Emison, 507 U. S. 25, 34 (1993).Electoral districting is a most difficult subject for legislatures, and so the States must have discretion to exercise thepolitical judgment necessary to balance competing interests.
Although race-based decisionmaking is inherently suspect,
e. g., Adarand, ante, at 218 (citing Bakke, 438 U. S., at 291(opinion of Powell, J.)), until a claimant makes a showing sufficient to support that allegation the good faith of a statelegislature must be presumed, see id., at 318-319 (opinion
of Powell, J.). The courts, in assessing the sufficiency of achallenge to a districting plan, must be sensitive to the com515us3$92l 09-10-98 09:40:04 PAGES OPINPGT
916 MILLER v. JOHNSON

Opinion of the Court
plex interplay of forces that enter a legislature's redistrictingcalculus. Redistricting legislatures will, for example, almost always be aware of racial demographics; but it does notfollow that race predominates in the redistricting process.
Shaw, supra, at 646; see Personnel Administrator of Mass.
v. Feeney, 442 U. S. 256, 279 (1979) (" `[D]iscriminatory' pur-pose' . . . implies more than intent as volition or intent as

awareness of consequences. It implies that the decision-maker . . . selected or reaffirmed a particular course of action
at least in part `because of,' not merely `in spite of,' its ad-verse effects") (footnotes and citation omitted). The distinction between being aware of racial considerations and being
motivated by them may be difficult to make. This evidentiary difficulty, together with the sensitive nature of redistricting and the presumption of good faith that must be
accorded legislative enactments, requires courts to exercise
extraordinary caution in adjudicating claims that a State has
drawn district lines on the basis of race. The plaintiff 's burden is to show, either through circumstantial evidence of a
district's shape and demographics or more direct evidence
going to legislative purpose, that race was the predominant
factor motivating the legislature's decision to place a significant number of voters within or without a particular district.
To make this showing, a plaintiff must prove that the legislature subordinated traditional race-neutral districting principles, including but not limited to compactness, contiguity,
and respect for political subdivisions or communities defined
by actual shared interests, to racial considerations. Where
these or other race-neutral considerations are the basis for
redistricting legislation, and are not subordinated to race, a
State can "defeat a claim that a district has been gerrymandered on racial lines." Shaw, supra, at 647. These principles inform the plaintiff 's burden of proof at trial. Of
course, courts must also recognize these principles, and the
intrusive potential of judicial intervention into the legislative
realm, when assessing under the Federal Rules of Civil

Procedure the adequacy of a plaintiff 's showing at the vari-ous stages of litigation and determining whether to permit

discovery or trial to proceed. See, e. g., Fed. Rules Civ.Proc. 12(b) and (e), 26(b)(2), 56; see also

Celotex Corp. v.
Catrett, 477 U. S. 317, 327 (1986).

In our view, the District Court applied the correct analy-sis, and its finding that race was the predominant factor motivating the drawing of the Eleventh District was not clearlyerroneous. The court found it was "exceedingly obvious"
from the shape of the Eleventh District, together with therelevant racial demographics, that the drawing of narrow
land bridges to incorporate within the district outlying appendages containing nearly 80% of the district's total black
population was a deliberate attempt to bring black populations into the district. 864 F. Supp., at 1375; see id., at 1374-
1376. Although by comparison with other districts the geometric shape of the Eleventh District may not seem bizarre
on its face, when its shape is considered in conjunction with
its racial and population densities, the story of racial gerrymandering seen by the District Court becomes much clearer.
See Appendix B, infra, following p. 928; see also App. 133.
Although this evidence is quite compelling, we need not determine whether it was, standing alone, sufficient to establish a Shaw claim that the Eleventh District is unexplainable
other than by race. The District Court had before it considerable additional evidence showing that the General Assembly was motivated by a predominant, overriding desire to
assign black populations to the Eleventh District and
thereby permit the creation of a third majority-black district
in the Second. 864 F. Supp., at 1372, 1378.

The court found that "it became obvious," both from the
Justice Department's objection letters and the three preclearance rounds in general, "that [the Justice Department]
would accept nothing less than abject surrender to its maximization agenda." Id., at 1366, n. 11; see id., at 1360-1367;
see also Arlington Heights, 429 U. S., at 267 ("historical

Opinion of the Court
background of the decision is one evidentiary source"). Itfurther found that the General Assembly acquiesced and as

a consequence was driven by its overriding desire to complywith the Department's maximization demands. The court
supported its conclusion not just with the testimony of Linda
Meggers, the operator of "Herschel," Georgia's reapportion-ment computer, and "probably the most knowledgeable person available on the subject of Georgian redistricting," 864F. Supp., at 1361, 1363, n. 6, 1366, but also with the State's
own concessions. The State admitted that it " `would nothave added those portions of Effingham and Chatham Counties that are now in the [far southeastern extension of the]
present Eleventh Congressional District but for the need to
include additional black population in that district to offset
the loss of black population caused by the shift of predominantly black portions of Bibb County in the Second Congressional District which occurred in response to the Department
of Justice's March 20th, 1992, objection letter.' " Id., at 1377.
It conceded further that "[t]o the extent that precincts in
the Eleventh Congressional District are split, a substantial
reason for their being split was the objective of increasing
the black population of that district." Ibid. And in its
brief to this Court, the State concedes that "[i]t is undisputed
that Georgia's eleventh is the product of a desire by the General Assembly to create a majority black district." Brief
for Miller Appellants 30. Hence the trial court had little
difficulty concluding that the Justice Department "spent
months demanding purely race-based revisions to Georgia's
redistricting plans, and that Georgia spent months attempting to comply." 864 F. Supp., at 1377. On this record, we
fail to see how the District Court could have reached any
conclusion other than that race was the predominant factor
in drawing Georgia's Eleventh District; and in any event we
conclude the court's finding is not clearly erroneous. Cf.
Wright v. Rockefeller, 376 U. S. 52, 56-57 (1964) (evidence
presented "conflicting inferences" and therefore "failed to

Opinion of the Court
prove that the New York Legislature was either motivatedby racial considerations or in fact drew the districts on racial lines").In light of its well-supported finding, the District Court
was justified in rejecting the various alternative explanations offered for the district. Although a legislature's com-pliance with "traditional districting principles such as compactness, contiguity, and respect for political subdivisions"may well suffice to refute a claim of racial gerrymandering,
Shaw, 509 U. S., at 647, appellants cannot make such a refuta-tion where, as here, those factors were subordinated to racial
objectives. Georgia's Attorney General objected to the Justice Department's demand for three majority-black districts
on the ground that to do so the State would have to "violate
all reasonable standards of compactness and contiguity."
App. 118. This statement from a state official is powerful
evidence that the legislature subordinated traditional districting principles to race when it ultimately enacted a plan
creating three majority-black districts, and justified the District Court's finding that "every [objective districting] factor
that could realistically be subordinated to racial tinkering in
fact suffered that fate." 864 F. Supp., at 1384; see id., at
1364, n. 8; id., at 1375 ("While the boundaries of the Eleventh
do indeed follow many precinct lines, this is because Ms.
Meggers designed the Eleventh District along racial lines,
and race data was most accessible to her at the precinct
level").

Nor can the State's districting legislation be rescued by
mere recitation of purported communities of interest. The
evidence was compelling "that there are no tangible `communities of interest' spanning the hundreds of miles of the Eleventh District." Id., at 1389-1390. A comprehensive report
demonstrated the fractured political, social, and economic
interests within the Eleventh District's black population.
See Plaintiff 's Exh. No. 85, pp. 10-27 (report of Timothy G.
O'Rourke, Ph.D.). It is apparent that it was not alleged

Opinion of the Court
shared interests but rather the object of maximizing thedistrict's black population and obtaining Justice Department

approval that in fact explained the General Assembly's ac-tions. 864 F. Supp., at 1366, 1378, 1380. A State is free to
recognize communities that have a particular racial makeup,provided its action is directed toward some common thread
of relevant interests. "[W]hen members of a racial grouplive together in one community, a reapportionment plan that
concentrates members of the group in one district and ex-cludes them from others may reflect wholly legitimate purposes." Shaw, 509 U. S., at 646. But where the State as-sumes from a group of voters' race that they "think alike,
share the same political interests, and will prefer the samecandidates at the polls," it engages in racial stereotyping at
odds with equal protection mandates. Id., at 647; cf. Powersv. Ohio, 499 U. S. 400, 410 (1991) ("We may not accept as
a defense to racial discrimination the very stereotype thelaw condemns").

Race was, as the District Court found, the predominant,overriding factor explaining the General Assembly's decision
to attach to the Eleventh District various appendages con-taining dense majority-black populations. 864 F. Supp., at
1372, 1378. As a result, Georgia's congressional redistrict-ing plan cannot be upheld unless it satisfies strict scrutiny,
our most rigorous and exacting standard of constitutionalreview.

III
To satisfy strict scrutiny, the State must demonstrate thatits districting legislation is narrowly tailored to achieve a

compelling interest. Shaw, supra, at 653-657; see also Croson, 488 U. S., at 494 (plurality opinion); Wygant, 476 U. S.,at 274, 280, and n. 6 (plurality opinion); cf. Adarand, ante, at

227. There is a "significant state interest in eradicating theeffects of past racial discrimination." Shaw, supra, at 656.
The State does not argue, however, that it created the Elev-enth District to remedy past discrimination, and with good

Opinion of the Court
reason: There is little doubt that the State's true interestin designing the Eleventh District was creating a third

majority-black district to satisfy the Justice Department'spreclearance demands. 864 F. Supp., at 1378 ("[T]he only
interest the General Assembly had in mind when drafting
the current congressional plan was satisfying [the Justice De-partment's] preclearance requirements");

id., at 1366; compare Wygant, supra, at 277 (plurality opinion) (under strictscrutiny, State must have convincing evidence that remedial

action is necessary before implementing affirmative action),with

Heller v. Doe, 509 U. S. 312, 320 (1993) (under rationalbasis review, legislature need not " `actually articulate at
any time the purpose or rationale supporting its classification' ") (quoting Nordlinger v. Hahn, 505 U. S. 1, 15 (1992)).
Whether or not in some cases compliance with the Act,
standing alone, can provide a compelling interest independent of any interest in remedying past discrimination, it cannot do so here. As we suggested in Shaw, compliance with
federal antidiscrimination laws cannot justify race-based districting where the challenged district was not reasonably
necessary under a constitutional reading and application of
those laws. See 509 U. S., at 653-655. The congressional
plan challenged here was not required by the Act under a
correct reading of the statute.

The Justice Department refused to preclear both of
Georgia's first two submitted redistricting plans. The District Court found that the Justice Department had adopted
a "black-maximization" policy under $ 5, and that it was
clear from its objection letters that the Department would
not grant preclearance until the State made the "Macon/
Savannah trade" and created a third majority-black district.
864 F. Supp., at 1366, 1380. It is, therefore, safe to say that
the congressional plan enacted in the end was required in
order to obtain preclearance. It does not follow, however,
that the plan was required by the substantive provisions of
the Act.

922 MILLER v. JOHNSON

Opinion of the Court
We do not accept the contention that the State has a com-pelling interest in complying with whatever preclearance

mandates the Justice Department issues. When a stategovernmental entity seeks to justify race-based remedies to
cure the effects of past discrimination, we do not accept the
government's mere assertion that the remedial action isrequired. Rather, we insist on a strong basis in evidence of

the harm being remedied. See, e. g., Shaw, supra, at 656;
Croson, supra, at 500-501; Wygant, supra, at 276-277 (plurality opinion). "The history of racial classifications in thiscountry suggests that blind judicial deference to legislative

or executive pronouncements of necessity has no place in
equal protection analysis." Croson, supra, at 501. Our
presumptive skepticism of all racial classifications, see Adarand, ante, at 223-224, prohibits us as well from accepting
on its face the Justice Department's conclusion that racial
districting is necessary under the Act. Where a State relies on the Department's determination that race-based
districting is necessary to comply with the Act, the judiciary retains an independent obligation in adjudicating consequent equal protection challenges to ensure that the State's
actions are narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling interest. See Shaw, supra, at 654. Were we to accept the
Justice Department's objection itself as a compelling interest adequate to insulate racial districting from constitutional
review, we would be surrendering to the Executive Branch
our role in enforcing the constitutional limits on race-based
official action. We may not do so. See, e. g., United States
v. Nixon, 418 U. S. 683, 704 (1974) ( judicial power cannot
be shared with Executive Branch); Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803) ("It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law
is"); cf. Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186, 211 (1962) (Supreme
Court is "ultimate interpreter of the Constitution"); Cooper
v. Aaron, 358 U. S. 1, 18 (1958) ("permanent and indispensable feature of our constitutional system" is that "the federal

Opinion of the Court
judiciary is supreme in the exposition of the law of theConstitution").

For the same reasons, we think it inappropriate for a courtengaged in constitutional scrutiny to accord deference to the
Justice Department's interpretation of the Act. Although
we have deferred to the Department's interpretation incertain statutory cases, see,

e. g., Presley v. Etowah County
Comm'n, 502 U. S. 491, 508-509 (1992), and cases citedtherein, we have rejected agency interpretations to which

we would otherwise defer where they raise serious consti-tutional questions.

Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida
Gulf Coast Building & Constr. Trades Council, 485 U. S.
568, 574-575 (1988). When the Justice Department's interpretation of the Act compels race-based districting, it by
definition raises a serious constitutional question, see, e. g.,
Bakke, 438 U. S., at 291 (opinion of Powell, J.) ("Racial and
ethnic distinctions of any sort are inherently supect" under
the Equal Protection Clause), and should not receive
deference.

Georgia's drawing of the Eleventh District was not required under the Act because there was no reasonable basis
to believe that Georgia's earlier enacted plans violated $ 5.
Wherever a plan is "ameliorative," a term we have used to
describe plans increasing the number of majority-minority
districts, it "cannot violate $ 5 unless the new apportionment
itself so discriminates on the basis of race or color as to violate the Constitution." Beer, 425 U. S., at 141. Georgia's
first and second proposed plans increased the number of
majority-black districts from 1 out of 10 (10%) to 2 out of 11
(18.18%). These plans were "ameliorative" and could not
have violated $ 5's nonretrogression principle. Ibid. Acknowledging as much, see Brief for United States 29; 864
F. Supp., at 1384-1385, the United States now relies on the
fact that the Justice Department may object to a state proposal either on the ground that it has a prohibited purpose
or a prohibited effect, see, e. g., Pleasant Grove v. United

924 MILLER v. JOHNSON

Opinion of the Court
States, 479 U. S. 462, 469 (1987). The Government justifiesits preclearance objections on the ground that the submitted

plans violated $ 5's purpose element. The key to the Gov-ernment's position, which is plain from its objection letters
if not from its briefs to this Court, compare App. 105-106,
124-125 with Brief for United States 31-33, is and alwayshas been that Georgia failed to proffer a nondiscriminatory

purpose for its refusal in the first two submissions to takethe steps necessary to create a third majority-minority
district.The Government's position is insupportable. "[A]meliorative changes, even if they fall short of what might be accomplished in terms of increasing minority representation, cannot be found to violate section 5 unless they so discriminate
on the basis of race or color as to violate the Constitution."
Days, Section 5 and the Role of the Justice Department, in
B. Grofman & C. Davidson, Controversies in Minority Voting
56 (1992). Although it is true we have held that the State
has the burden to prove a nondiscriminatory purpose under

$ 5, e. g., Pleasant Grove, supra, at 469, Georgia's Attorney
General provided a detailed explanation for the State's initial
decision not to enact the max-black plan, see App. 117-119.
The District Court accepted this explanation, 864 F. Supp.,
at 1365, and found an absence of any discriminatory intent,
id., at 1363, and n. 7. The State's policy of adhering to other
districting principles instead of creating as many majorityminority districts as possible does not support an inference
that the plan "so discriminates on the basis of race or color
as to violate the Constitution," Beer, supra, at 141; see
Mobile v. Bolden, 446 U. S. 55 (1980) (plurality opinion),
and thus cannot provide any basis under $ 5 for the Justice
Department's objection.

Instead of grounding its objections on evidence of a discriminatory purpose, it would appear the Government was
driven by its policy of maximizing majority-black districts.
Although the Government now disavows having had that

Opinion of the Court
policy, see Brief for United States 35, and seems to concede
its impropriety, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 32-33, the District
Court's well-documented factual finding was that the Department did adopt a maximization policy and followed it in objecting to Georgia's first two plans.* One of the two Department of Justice line attorneys overseeing the Georgia
preclearance process himself disclosed that " `what we did
and what I did specifically was to take a . . . map of the State
of Georgia shaded for race, shaded by minority concentration, and overlay the districts that were drawn by the State
of Georgia and see how well those lines adequately reflected
black voting strength.' " 864 F. Supp., at 1362, n. 4. In
utilizing $ 5 to require States to create majority-minority
districts wherever possible, the Department of Justice
expanded its authority under the statute beyond what
Congress intended and we have upheld.

Section 5 was directed at preventing a particular set of
invidious practices that had the effect of "undo[ing] or defeat[ing] the rights recently won by nonwhite voters."

*See 864 F. Supp. 1354, 1361 (SD Ga. 1994) (quoting Rep. Tyrone Brooks,
who recalled on the Assembly Floor that " `the Attorney General . . . specifically told the states covered by the Act that wherever possible, you
must draw majority black districts, wherever possible' "); id., at 1362-1363,
and n. 4 (citing 3 Tr. 23-24: Assistant Attorney General answering "Yes"
to question whether "the Justice Department did take the position in a
number of these cases, that if alternative plans demonstrated that more
minority districts could be drawn than the state was proposing to draw
. . . that did, in fact, violate Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act?"); 864 F.
Supp., at 1365-1366; id., at 1366, n. 11 ("It became obvious that [the Justice
Department] would accept nothing less than abject surrender to its maximization agenda"); id., at 1368 ("It apparently did not occur to [the Justice

while perhaps admirable, is properly tempered with other districting considerations"); id., at 1382-1383 (expressing doubts as to the constitutionality of [the Justice Department's] " `maximization' policy"); id., at 1383,

maximization propensities").

926 MILLER v. JOHNSON

Opinion of the Court
H. R. Rep. No. 91-397, p. 8 (1969). As we explained in Beerv.

United States,

" `Section 5 was a response to a common practice insome jurisdictions of staying one step ahead of the federal courts by passing new discriminatory voting lawsas soon as the old ones had been struck down. That
practice had been possible because each new law re-mained in effect until the Justice Department or private
plaintiffs were able to sustain the burden of proving thatthe new law, too, was discriminatory. . . . Congress therefore decided, as the Supreme Court held it could, "to
shift the advantage of time and inertia from the perpe-trators of the evil to its victim," by "freezing election

procedures in the covered areas unless the changes canbe shown to be nondiscriminatory." ' " 425 U. S., at 140
(quoting H. R. Rep. No. 94-196, pp. 57-58 (1975) (foot-notes omitted)).

Based on this historical understanding, we recognized in
Beer that "the purpose of $ 5 has always been to insure that
no voting-procedure changes would be made that would leadto a retrogression in the position of racial minorities with

respect to their effective exercise of the electoral franchise."425 U. S., at 141. The Justice Department's maximization
policy seems quite far removed from this purpose. We are
especially reluctant to conclude that $ 5 justifies that policygiven the serious constitutional concerns it raises. In

South
Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U. S. 301 (1966), we upheld $ 5as a necessary and constitutional response to some States'

"extraordinary stratagem[s] of contriving new rules of various kinds for the sole purpose of perpetuating voting discrimination in the face of adverse federal court decrees."
Id., at 335 (footnote omitted); see also City of Rome v. United
States, 446 U. S., at 173-183. But our belief in Katzenbach
that the federalism costs exacted by $ 5 preclearance could
be justified by those extraordinary circumstances does not

Opinion of the Court
mean they can be justified in the circumstances of this litiga-tion. And the Justice Department's implicit command that

States engage in presumptively unconstitutional race-baseddistricting brings the Act, once upheld as a proper exercise
of Congress' authority under $ 2 of the Fifteenth Amend-ment,

Katzenbach, supra, at 327, 337, into tension with theFourteenth Amendment. As we recalled in Katzenbach itself, Congress' exercise of its Fifteenth Amendment author-ity even when otherwise proper still must " `consist with the
letter and spirit of the constitution.' " 383 U. S., at 326(quoting McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 421 (1819)).
We need not, however, resolve these troubling and difficultconstitutional questions today. There is no indication Congress intended such a far-reaching application of $ 5, so wereject the Justice Department's interpretation of the statute
and avoid the constitutional problems that interpretationraises. See,

e. g., DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf CoastTrades Council, 485 U. S., at 575.

IV
The Act, and its grant of authority to the federal courts touncover official efforts to abridge minorities' right to vote,

has been of vital importance in eradicating invidious dis-crimination from the electoral process and enhancing the
legitimacy of our political institutions. Only if our polit-ical system and our society cleanse themselves of that
discrimination will all members of the polity share an equalopportunity to gain public office regardless of race. As a
Nation we share both the obligation and the aspiration ofworking toward this end. The end is neither assured nor
well served, however, by carving electorates into racial blocs."If our society is to continue to progress as a multiracial
democracy, it must recognize that the automatic invocationof race stereotypes retards that progress and causes continued hurt and injury." Edmondson v. Leesville Concrete Co.,500 U. S. 614, 630-631 (1991). It takes a shortsighted and

The judgment of the District Court is affirmed, and thecases are remanded for further proceedings consistent with

this decision.

It is so ordered.

Justice O'Connor, concurring.
I understand the threshold standard the Court adopts--that "the legislature subordinated traditional race-neutral

districting principles . . . to racial considerations," ante, at916--to be a demanding one. To invoke strict scrutiny, a
plaintiff must show that the State has relied on race in sub-stantial disregard of customary and traditional districting
practices. Those practices provide a crucial frame of refer-ence and therefore constitute a significant governing principle in cases of this kind. The standard would be no differentif a legislature had drawn the boundaries to favor some other
ethnic group; certainly the standard does not treat efforts tocreate majority-minority districts

less favorably than similarefforts on behalf of other groups. Indeed, the driving force

behind the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment was thedesire to end legal discrimination against blacks.

Application of the Court's standard does not throw intodoubt the vast majority of the Nation's 435 congressional
districts, where presumably the States have drawn theboundaries in accordance with their customary districting
principles. That is so even though race may well have been

considered in the redistricting process. See Shaw v. Reno,509 U. S. 630, 646 (1993); ante, at 916. But application of

the Court's standard helps achieve Shaw's basic objectiveof making extreme instances of gerrymandering subject
to meaningful judicial review. I therefore join the Court'sopinion.

Justice Stevens, dissenting.
Justice Ginsburg has explained why the District Court'sopinion on the merits was erroneous and why this Court's

law-changing decision will breed unproductive litigation. Ijoin her excellent opinion without reservation. I add these
comments because I believe the appellees in these cases, likethe appellees in

United States v. Hays, ante, p. 737, have notsuffered any legally cognizable injury.

In Shaw v. Reno, 509 U. S. 630 (1993), the Court crafted anew cause of action with two novel, troubling features.
First, the Court misapplied the term "gerrymander," pre-viously used to describe grotesque line-drawing by a dominant group to maintain or enhance its political power ata minority's expense, to condemn the efforts of a majority (whites) to share its power with a minority (African-Americans). Second, the Court dispensed with its previous
insistence in vote dilution cases on a showing of injury to anidentifiable group of voters, but it failed to explain adequately what showing a plaintiff must make to establishstanding to litigate the newly minted

Shaw claim. Neither
in Shaw itself nor in the cases decided today has the Courtcoherently articulated what injury this cause of action is designed to redress. Because appellees have alleged no legally cognizable injury, they lack standing, and these casesshould be dismissed. See

Hays, ante, at 750-751 (Stevens,
J., concurring in judgment).Even assuming the validity of

Shaw, I cannot see how
appellees in these cases could assert the injury the Courtattributes to them. Appellees, plaintiffs below, are white

Stevens, J., dissenting
voters in Georgia's Eleventh Congressional District. TheCourt's conclusion that they have standing to maintain a

Shaw claim appears to rest on a theory that their placementin the Eleventh District caused them " `representational
harms.' " Hays, ante, at 744, cited ante, at 909. The Shaw
Court explained the concept of "representational harms" asfollows: "When a district obviously is created solely to effectuate the perceived common interests of one racial group,elected officials are more likely to believe that their primary
obligation is to represent only the members of that group,rather than their constituency as a whole."

Shaw, 509 U. S.,
at 648. Although the Shaw Court attributed representational harms solely to a message sent by the legislature's
action, those harms can only come about if the message is
received--that is, first, if all or most black voters support
the same candidate, and, second, if the successful candidate
ignores the interests of her white constituents. Appellees'
standing, in other words, ultimately depends on the very
premise the Court purports to abhor: that voters of a particular race " `think alike, share the same political interests,
and will prefer the same candidates at the polls.' " Ante, at
912 (quoting Shaw, 509 U. S., at 647). This generalization,
as the Court recognizes, is "offensive and demeaning."
Ante, at 912.

In particular instances, of course, members of one race
may vote by an overwhelming margin for one candidate, and
in some cases that candidate will be of the same race. "Racially polarized voting" is one of the circumstances plaintiffs
must prove to advance a vote dilution claim. Thornburg v.
Gingles, 478 U. S. 30, 56-58 (1986). Such a claim allows voters to allege that gerrymandered district lines have impaired
their ability to elect a candidate of their own race. The
Court emphasizes, however, that a so-called Shaw claim is
" `analytically distinct' from a vote dilution claim," ante, at
911 (quoting Shaw, 509 U. S., at 652). Neither in Shaw, nor
in Hays, nor in the instant cases has the Court answered the

931Cite as: 515 U. S. 900 (1995)
Stevens, J., dissenting
question its analytic distinction raises: If the Shaw injurydoes not flow from an increased probability that white candidates will lose, then how can the increased probability thatblack candidates will win cause white voters, such as appellees, cognizable harm? 1The Court attempts an explanation in these cases by
equating the injury it imagines appellees have suffered withthe injuries African-Americans suffered under segregation.
The heart of appellees' claim, by the Court's account, is that"a State's assignment of voters on the basis of race,"

ante,at 915, violates the Equal Protection Clause for the same

reason a State may not "segregate citizens on the basis ofrace in its public parks, New Orleans City Park Improvement Assn. v. Detiege, 358 U. S. 54 (1958) (per curiam),buses,

Gayle v. Browder, 352 U. S. 903 (1956) (per curiam),golf courses, Holmes v. Atlanta, 350 U. S. 879 (1955) (per

curiam), beaches, Mayor of Baltimore v. Dawson, 350 U. S.877 (1955) (per curiam), and schools, Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954)." Ante, at 911. This equation,however, fails to elucidate the elusive Shaw injury. Our desegregation cases redressed the exclusion of black citizensfrom public facilities reserved for whites. In these cases, in
contrast, any voter, black or white, may live in the EleventhDistrict. What appellees contest is the

inclusion of toomany black voters in the district as drawn. In my view, if

appellees allege no vote dilution, that inclusion can causethem no conceivable injury.

The Court's equation of Shaw claims with our desegrega-tion decisions is inappropriate for another reason. In each
of those cases, legal segregation frustrated the public inter-est in diversity and tolerance by barring African-Americans

1 White voters obviously lack standing to complain of the other injury
the Court has recognized under Shaw: the stigma blacks supposedly suffer
when assigned to a district because of their race. See Hays, ante, at 744;

from joining whites in the activities at issue. The district-ing plan here, in contrast, serves the interest in diversity

and tolerance by increasing the likelihood that a meaningfulnumber of black representatives will add their voices to legislative debates. See post, at 947-948 (Ginsburg, J., dis-senting). "There is no moral or constitutional equivalence
between a policy that is designed to perpetuate a caste sys-tem and one that seeks to eradicate racial subordination."
Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pen~ a, ante, at 243 (Stevens,J., dissenting); see also

Adarand, ante, at 247-248, n. 5(
Stevens, J., dissenting). That racial integration of the sortattempted by Georgia now appears more vulnerable to judicial challenge than some policies alleged to perpetuate racialbias, cf. Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737 (1984), is anomalous,
to say the least.Equally distressing is the Court's equation of traditional
gerrymanders, designed to maintain or enhance a dominantgroup's power, with a dominant group's decision to share its
power with a previously underrepresented group. In myview, districting plans violate the Equal Protection Clause
when they "serve no purpose other than to favor one seg-ment--whether racial, ethnic, religious, economic, or political--that may occupy a position of strength at a particularpoint in time, or to disadvantage a politically weak segment
of the community." Karcher v. Daggett, 462 U. S. 725, 748(1983) (

Stevens, J., concurring). In contrast, I do not see
how a districting plan that favors a politically weak groupcan violate equal protection. The Constitution does not

mandate any form of proportional representation, but itcertainly permits a State to adopt a policy that promotes
fair representation of different groups. Indeed, this Courtsquarely so held in

Gaffney v. Cummings, 412 U. S. 735
(1973):

"[N]either we nor the district courts have a constitutional warrant to invalidate a state plan, otherwise

within tolerable population limits, because it under-takes, not to minimize or eliminate the political strength

of any group or party, but to recognize it and, throughdistricting, provide a rough sort of proportional representation in the legislative halls of the State." Id., at754.

The Court's refusal to distinguish an enactment that helpsa minority group from enactments that cause it harm is especially unfortunate at the intersection of race and voting,given that African-Americans and other disadvantaged
groups have struggled so long and so hard for inclusion inthat most central exercise of our democracy. See

post, at936-938 (
Ginsburg, J., dissenting). I have long believedthat treating racial groups differently from other identifiable

groups of voters, as the Court does today, is itself an invidi-ous racial classification. Racial minorities should receive
neither more nor less protection than other groups againstgerrymanders.

2 A fortiori, racial minorities should not be

less eligible than other groups to benefit from districtingplans the majority designs to aid them.

I respectfully dissent.
2 "In my opinion an interpretation of the Constitution which afforded
one kind of political protection to blacks and another kind to members of
other identifiable groups would itself be invidious. Respect for the citizenry in the black community compels acceptance of the fact that in the
long run there is no more certainty that these individuals will vote alike
than will individual members of any other ethnic, economic, or social
group. The probability of parallel voting fluctuates as the blend of political issues affecting the outcome of an election changes from time to time
to emphasize one issue, or a few, rather than others, as dominant. The
facts that a political group has its own history, has suffered its own special
injustices, and has its own congeries of special political interests, do not
make one such group different from any other in the eyes of the law. The
members of each go to the polls with equal dignity and with an equal right
to be protected from invidious discrimination." Cousins v. City Council
of Chicago, 466 F. 2d 830, 852 (CA7 1972) (Stevens, J., dissenting).

Justice Ginsburg, with whom Justice Stevens and
Justice Breyer join, and with whom Justice Souter joinsexcept as to Part III-B, dissenting.

Legislative districting is highly political business. ThisCourt has generally respected the competence of state legislatures to attend to the task. When race is the issue, how-ever, we have recognized the need for judicial intervention
to prevent dilution of minority voting strength. Genera-tions of rank discrimination against African-Americans, as
citizens and voters, account for that surveillance.Two Terms ago, in Shaw v. Reno, 509 U. S. 630 (1993), this
Court took up a claim "analytically distinct" from a vote dilu-tion claim.

Id., at 652. Shaw authorized judicial interven-tion in "extremely irregular" apportionments, id., at 642, in

which the legislature cast aside traditional districting prac-tices to consider race alone--in the Shaw case, to create a
district in North Carolina in which African-Americans wouldcompose a majority of the voters.

Today the Court expands the judicial role, announcing thatfederal courts are to undertake searching review of any district with contours "predominant[ly] motivat[ed]" by race:"[S]trict scrutiny" will be triggered not only when traditional districting practices are abandoned, but also whenthose practices are "subordinated to"--given less weight
than--race. See ante, at 916. Applying this new "race-as-predominant-factor" standard, the Court invalidates
Georgia's districting plan even though Georgia's EleventhDistrict, the focus of today's dispute, bears the imprint of
familiar districting practices. Because I do not endorse theCourt's new standard and would not upset Georgia's plan,
I dissent. I

At the outset, it may be useful to note points on which theCourt does not divide. First, we agree that federalism and
the slim judicial competence to draw district lines weigh

935Cite as: 515 U. S. 900 (1995)
Ginsburg, J., dissenting
heavily against judicial intervention in apportionment decisions; as a rule, the task should remain within the domain of
state legislatures. See ante, at 915; Reynolds v. Sims, 377
U. S. 533, 586 (1964) ("[L]egislative reapportionment is primarily a matter for legislative consideration and determination . . . ."). Second, for most of our Nation's history, the
franchise has not been enjoyed equally by black citizens and
white voters. To redress past wrongs and to avert any
recurrence of exclusion of blacks from political processes,
federal courts now respond to Equal Protection Clause and
Voting Rights Act complaints of state action that dilutes
minority voting strength. See, e. g., Thornburg v. Gingles,
478 U. S. 30 (1986); White v. Regester, 412 U. S. 755 (1973).
Third, to meet statutory requirements, state legislatures
must sometimes consider race as a factor highly relevant to
the drawing of district lines. See Pildes & Niemi, Expressive Harms, "Bizarre Districts," and Voting Rights: Evaluating Election-District Appearances After Shaw v. Reno, 92
Mich. L. Rev. 483, 496 (1993) ("compliance with the [Voting
Rights Act] and Gingles necessarily requires race-conscious
districting"). Finally, state legislatures may recognize communities that have a particular racial or ethnic makeup, even
in the absence of any compulsion to do so, in order to account
for interests common to or shared by the persons grouped
together. See Shaw, 509 U. S., at 646 ("[W]hen members of
a racial group live together in one community, a reapportionment plan that concentrates members of the group in one
district and excludes them from others may reflect wholly
legitimate purposes.").

Therefore, the fact that the Georgia General Assembly
took account of race in drawing district lines--a fact not in
dispute--does not render the State's plan invalid. To offend
the Equal Protection Clause, all agree, the legislature had to
do more than consider race. How much more, is the issue
that divides the Court today.

"We say once again what has been said on many occasions:
reapportionment is primarily the duty and responsibility of
the State through its legislature or other body, rather than
of a federal court." Chapman v. Meier, 420 U. S. 1, 27
(1975); see also ante, at 915. The Constitution itself allocates this responsibility to States. U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 2;
Growe v. Emison, 507 U. S. 25, 34 (1993).

"Districting inevitably has sharp political impact and inevitably political decisions must be made by those charged with
the task." White v. Weiser, 412 U. S. 783, 795-796 (1973).
District lines are drawn to accommodate a myriad of factors--geographic, economic, historical, and political--and
state legislatures, as arenas of compromise and electoral
accountability, are best positioned to mediate competing
claims; courts, with a mandate to adjudicate, are ill equipped
for the task.

B

Federal courts have ventured into the political thicket of
apportionment when necessary to secure to members of
racial minorities equal voting rights--rights denied in many
States, including Georgia, until not long ago.

The Fifteenth Amendment, ratified in 1870, declares that
the right to vote "shall not be denied . . . by any State on
account of race." That declaration, for generations, was
often honored in the breach; it was greeted by a near century
of "unremitting and ingenious defiance" in several States, including Georgia. South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U. S.
301, 309 (1966). After a brief interlude of black suffrage enforced by federal troops but accompanied by rampant violence against blacks, Georgia held a constitutional convention
in 1877. Its purpose, according to the convention's leader,
was to " `fix it so that the people shall rule and the Negro
shall never be heard from.' " McDonald, Binford, & Johnson, Georgia, in Quiet Revolution in the South 68 (C. David515us3$92p 09-10-98 09:40:04 PAGES OPINPGT

son & B. Grofman eds. 1994) (quoting Robert Toombs). Inpursuit of this objective, Georgia enacted a cumulative poll

tax, requiring voters to show they had paid past as well ascurrent poll taxes; one historian described this tax as the
"most effective bar to Negro suffrage ever devised." A.
Stone, Studies in the American Race Problem 354-355(1908).

In 1890, the Georgia General Assembly authorized "whiteprimaries"; keeping blacks out of the Democratic primary
effectively excluded them from Georgia's political life,for victory in the Democratic primary was tantamount to
election. McDonald, Binford, & Johnson, supra, at 68-69.
Early in this century, Georgia Governor Hoke Smith persuaded the legislature to pass the "Disenfranchisement Act
of 1908"; true to its title, this measure added various property, "good character," and literacy requirements that, as
administered, served to keep blacks from voting. Id., at 69;
see also Katzenbach, 383 U. S., at 310 (tests of this order
were "specifically designed to prevent Negroes from voting"). The result, as one commentator observed 25 years
later, was an " `almost absolute exclusion of the Negro voice
in state and federal elections.' " McDonald, Binford, &
Johnson, supra, at 70 (quoting R. Wardlaw, Negro Suffrage
in Georgia, 1867-1930, p. 69 (unpublished 1932)).

Faced with a political situation scarcely open to selfcorrection--disenfranchised blacks had no electoral influence, hence no muscle to lobby the legislature for change--
the Court intervened. It invalidated white primaries, see
Smith v. Allwright, 321 U. S. 649 (1944), and other burdens
on minority voting. See, e. g., Schnell v. Davis, 336 U. S.
933 (1949) (per curiam) (discriminatory application of voting
tests); Lane v. Wilson, 307 U. S. 268 (1939) (procedural hurdles); Guinn v. United States, 238 U. S. 347 (1915) (grandfather clauses).

It was against this backdrop that the Court, construing
the Equal Protection Clause, undertook to ensure that ap515us3$92p 09-10-98 09:40:04 PAGES OPINPGT

portionment plans do not dilute minority voting strength.
See, e. g., Rogers v. Lodge, 458 U. S. 613, 617 (1982); Regester,
412 U. S., at 765; Wright v. Rockefeller, 376 U. S. 52, 57
(1964). By enacting the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Congress heightened federal judicial involvement in apportionment, and also fashioned a role for the Attorney General.
Section 2 creates a federal right of action to challenge vote
dilution. Section 5 requires States with a history of discrimination to preclear any changes in voting practices with
either a federal court (a three-judge United States District
Court for the District of Columbia) or the Attorney General.

These Court decisions and congressional directions significantly reduced voting discrimination against minorities.
In the 1972 election, Georgia gained its first black Member of
Congress since Reconstruction, and the 1981 apportionment
created the State's first majority-minority district.1 This
voting district, however, was not gained easily. Georgia
created it only after the United States District Court for
the District of Columbia refused to preclear a predecessor
apportionment plan that included no such district--an omission due in part to the influence of Joe Mack Wilson, then
Chairman of the Georgia House Reapportionment Committee. As Wilson put it only 14 years ago, " `I don't want to
draw nigger districts.' " Busbee v. Smith, 549 F. Supp. 494,
501 (DC 1982).

Before Shaw v. Reno, 509 U. S. 630 (1993), this Court invoked the Equal Protection Clause to justify intervention in
the quintessentially political task of legislative districting in
two circumstances: to enforce the one-person-one-vote requirement, see Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U. S. 533 (1964); and

1 Georgia's population is approximately 27 percent black. 864 F. Supp.

to prevent dilution of a minority group's voting strength, seeRegester, 412 U. S., at 765; Wright, 376 U. S., at 57.

In Shaw, the Court recognized a third basis for an equalprotection challenge to a State's apportionment plan. The

Court wrote cautiously, emphasizing that judicial interven-tion is exceptional: Strict judicial scrutiny is in order, the
Court declared, if a district is "so extremely irregular on itsface that it rationally can be viewed only as an effort to segregate the races for purposes of voting." 509 U. S., at 642."[E]xtrem[e] irregular[ity]" was evident in

Shaw, theCourt explained, setting out this description of the North

Carolina voting district under examination:

"It is approximately 160 miles long and, for much of itslength, no wider than the I-85 corridor. It winds in

snakelike fashion through tobacco country, financial cen-ters, and manufacturing areas until it gobbles in enough
enclaves of black neighborhoods. Northbound andsouthbound drivers on I-85 sometimes find themselves
in separate districts in one county, only to `trade' dis-tricts when they enter the next county. Of the 10 counties through which District 12 passes, 5 are cut into 3different districts; even towns are divided. At one
point the district remains contiguous only because it in-tersects at a single point with two other districts before
crossing over them. One state legislator has remarkedthat ` "[i]f you drove down the interstate with both car

2 In the vote dilution category, Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U. S. 339
(1960), was a pathmarker. There, the city of Tuskegee redrew its boundaries to exclude black voters. This apportionment was unconstitutional
not simply because it was motivated by race, but notably because it had a
dilutive effect: It disenfranchised Tuskegee's black community. See id.,
at 341 ("The essential inevitable effect of this redefinition of Tuskegee's
boundaries is to remove from the city all save only four or five of its 400
Negro voters while not removing a single white voter or resident. The
result of the Act is to deprive the Negro petitioners discriminatorily of
the benefits of residence in Tuskegee, including, inter alia, the right to
vote in municipal elections.").

Vince Lombardi Have Been Right If He Had Said:`When It Comes to Redistricting, Race Isn't Everything,

Id.,at 635-636 (some citations and internal quotation

marks omitted).
The problem in Shaw was not the plan architects' consider-ation of race as relevant in redistricting. Rather, in the

Court's estimation, it was the virtual exclusion of otherfactors from the calculus. Traditional districting practices
were cast aside, the Court concluded, with race alone steer-ing placement of district lines.

B
The record before us does not show that race similarlyoverwhelmed traditional districting practices in Georgia.

Although the Georgia General Assembly prominently con-sidered race in shaping the Eleventh District, race did not
crowd out all other factors, as the Court found it did in NorthCarolina's delineation of the

Shaw district.In contrast to the snake-like North Carolina district inspected in Shaw, Georgia's Eleventh District is hardly"bizarre," "extremely irregular," or "irrational on its face."
Id., at 642, 644, 658. Instead, the Eleventh District's designreflects significant consideration of "traditional districting
factors (such as keeping political subdivisions intact) and theusual political process of compromise and trades for a variety
of nonracial reasons." 864 F. Supp. 1354, 1397, n. 5 (SD Ga.1994) (Edmondson, J., dissenting); cf.

ante, at 917 ("geometricshape of the Eleventh District may not seem bizarre on its

face"). The district covers a core area in central and east515us3$92p 09-10-98 09:40:04 PAGES OPINPGT

ern Georgia, and its total land area of 6,780 square miles isabout average for the State. Defendant's Exh. 177, p. 4.

3

The border of the Eleventh District runs 1,184 miles, in linewith Georgia's Second District, which has a 1,243-mile border, and the State's Eighth District, with a border running
1,155 miles. See 864 F. Supp., at 1396 (Edmondson, J.,
dissenting).4

Nor does the Eleventh District disrespect the boundaries
of political subdivisions. Of the 22 counties in the district,
14 are intact and 8 are divided. See Joint Exh. 17. That
puts the Eleventh District at about the state average in divided counties. By contrast, of the Sixth District's five
counties, none are intact, ibid., and of the Fourth District's
four counties, just one is intact. Ibid.5 Seventy-one percent of the Eleventh District's boundaries track the borders
of political subdivisions. See 864 F. Supp., at 1396 (Edmondson, J., dissenting). Of the State's 11 districts, 5 score worse
than the Eleventh District on this criterion, and 5 score bet3 Georgia's First, Second, and Eighth Districts each have a total area
of over 10,100 square miles. 864 F. Supp., at 1396 (Edmondson, J.,
dissenting).

4 Although the Eleventh District comes within 58 miles of crossing the

entire State, this is not unusual in Georgia: The Ninth District spans the
State's entire northern border, and the First, Second, and Eighth Districts
begin at the Florida border and stretch north to almost the middle of

the State. See ibid. (Edmondson, J., dissenting). In the 1980's, Georgia's Eighth District extended even farther, in an irregular pattern from
the southeast border with Florida to nearly the Atlanta suburbs. See
App. 80.

5 The First District has 20 intact counties and parts of 2 others. The

Second District has 23 intact counties and parts of 12 others. The Third
District has 8 intact counties and parts of 8 others. The Fifth District is
composed of parts of 4 counties. The Seventh District has 10 intact counties and part of 1 county. The Eighth District has 22 intact counties and
parts of 10 others. The Ninth District has 19 intact counties and part of 1
other. The Tenth District has 16 intact counties and parts of 3 others.

7

And notably, the Eleventh District's boundaries largelyfollow precinct lines.

8

Evidence at trial similarly shows that considerations otherthan race went into determining the Eleventh District's

boundaries. For a "political reason"--to accommodate therequest of an incumbent State Senator regarding the placement of the precinct in which his son lived--the DeKalbCounty portion of the Eleventh District was drawn to include a particular (largely white) precinct. 2 Tr. 187, 202.The corridor through Effingham County was substantially
narrowed at the request of a (white) State Representative.2 Tr. 189-190, 212-214. In Chatham County, the district
was trimmed to exclude a heavily black community in Gar-den City because a State Representative wanted to keep the
city intact inside the neighboring First District. 2 Tr. 218-219. The Savannah extension was configured by "the narrowest means possible" to avoid splitting the city of PortWentworth. 4 Tr. 172-174, 175-178, 181-183.

6 The Sixth District scores lowest, with just 45 percent of its boundaries
following political subdivision lines. The Ninth District rates highest,
with 91 percent. Defendant's Exh. 177, p. 3.

7 On this measure, only three districts--the First, Seventh, and Ninth--

rate higher than the Eleventh District. Excluding the Fifth and Sixth
Districts, which contain no intact counties, the scores range from about 30
percent for the Fourth District to 97 percent for the Seventh District.
Id., at 4.

8 The Court turns the significance of this fact on its head by stating:

" `While the boundaries of the Eleventh do indeed follow many precinct
lines, this is because Ms. Meggers designed the Eleventh District along
racial lines, and race data was most accessible to her at the precinct
level.' " Ante, at 919 (quoting 864 F. Supp., at 1384). To this curious
comment, one can only demur. Yes, Georgia's plan considered race, but
by following precinct lines, it did so in an altogether proper way, i. e.,
without disregarding traditional districting practices.

Georgia's Eleventh District, in sum, is not an outlier dis-trict shaped without reference to familiar districting techniques. Tellingly, the district that the Court's decisiontoday unsettles is not among those on a statistically calculated list of the 28 most bizarre districts in the United States,a study prepared in the wake of our decision in

Shaw. SeePildes & Niemi, 92 Mich. L. Rev., at 565.

C
The Court suggests that it was not Georgia's Legislature,but the U. S. Department of Justice, that effectively drew

the lines, and that Department officers did so with nothingbut race in mind. Yet the "Max-Black" plan advanced by
the Attorney General was not the plan passed by the GeorgiaGeneral Assembly.

different in shape in many ways. These differences show. . . consideration of other matters beyond race . . . .").

10

And although the Attorney General refused preclearanceto the first two plans approved by Georgia's Legislature, the

State was not thereby disarmed; Georgia could have de-manded relief from the Department's objections by instituting a civil action in the United States District Court for theDistrict of Columbia, with ultimate review in this Court.
Instead of pursuing that avenue, the State chose to adopt theplan here in controversy--a plan the State forcefully defends

Along with attention to size, shape, and political subdivi-sions, the Court recognizes as an appropriate districting

principle, "respect for . . . communities defined by actualshared interests."

"fractured political, social, and economic interests within theEleventh District's black population."

Ante, at 919.But ethnicity itself can tie people together, as volumes of

social science literature have documented--even people withdivergent economic interests. For this reason, ethnicity is
a significant force in political life. As stated in a classicstudy of ethnicity in one city of immigrants:

"[M]any elements--history, family and feeling, interest,formal organizational life--operate to keep much of New
York life channeled within the bounds of the ethnicgroup. . . .

Nation's cities are full of districts identified by their ethnic
character--Chinese, Irish, Italian, Jewish, Polish, Russian,
for example. See, e. g., S. Erie, Rainbow's End: IrishAmericans and the Dilemmas of Urban Machine Politics,
1840-1985, p. 91 (1988) (describing Jersey City's "Horseshoe
district" as "lumping most of the city's Irish together"); Coveted Landmarks Add a Twist to Redistricting Task, Los
Angeles Times, Sept. 10, 1991, pp. A1, A24 ("In San Francisco in 1961, . . . an Irish Catholic [State Assembly member]
`wanted his district drawn following [Catholic] parish lines
so all the parishes where he went to baptisms, weddings
and funerals would be in his district' . . . ."); Stone, Goode:
Bad and Indifferent, Washington Monthly, July-Aug. 1986,
pp. 27, 28 (discussing "The Law of Ethnic Loyalty-- . . . a
universal law of politics," and identifying "predominantly
Italian wards of South Philadelphia," a "Jewish Los Angeles
district," and a "Polish district in Chicago"). The creation
of ethnic districts reflecting felt identity is not ordinarily
viewed as offensive or demeaning to those included in the
delineation.

III

To separate permissible and impermissible use of race in
legislative apportionment, the Court orders strict scrutiny
for districting plans "predominantly motivated" by race. No
longer can a State avoid judicial oversight by giving--as in
this case--genuine and measurable consideration to traditional districting practices. Instead, a federal case can be
mounted whenever plaintiffs plausibly allege that other factors carried less weight than race. This invitation to litigate
against the State seems to me neither necessary nor proper.

A
The Court derives its test from diverse opinions on the
relevance of race in contexts distinctly unlike apportionment.

946 MILLER v. JOHNSON

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
See ante, at 911-912.11 The controlling idea, the Court says,
is " `the simple command [at the heart of the Constitution's
guarantee of equal protection] that the Government must
treat citizens as individuals, not as simply components of a
racial, religious, sexual or national class.' " See ante, at 911
(quoting Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC, 497 U. S. 547, 602
(1990) (O'Connor, J., dissenting)) (some internal quotation
marks omitted). But cf. Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U. S.
303, 307 (1880) (pervading purpose of post-Civil War Amendments was to bar discrimination against once-enslaved race).

11 I would follow precedent directly on point. In United Jewish Organizations of Williamsburgh, Inc. v. Carey, 430 U. S. 144 (1977) (UJO), even
though the State "deliberately used race in a purposeful manner" to create
majority-minority districts, id., at 165 (opinion of White, J., joined by
Rehnquist and Stevens, JJ.), seven of eight Justices participating voted
to uphold the State's plan without subjecting it to strict scrutiny. Five
Justices specifically agreed that the intentional creation of majorityminority districts does not give rise to an equal protection claim, absent
proof that the districting diluted the majority's voting strength. See ibid.
(opinion of White, J., joined by Rehnquist and Stevens, JJ.); id., at 179-
180 (Stewart, J., concurring in judgment, joined by Powell, J.).

Nor is UJO best understood as a vote dilution case. Petitioners' claim
in UJO was that the State had "violated the Fourteenth and Fifteenth
Amendments by deliberately revising its reapportionment plan along racial lines." Id., at 155 (opinion of White, J., joined by Brennan, Blackmun,
and Stevens, JJ.) (emphasis added). Petitioners themselves stated:
" `Our argument is . . . that the history of the area demonstrates that
there could be--and in fact was--no reason other than race to divide the
community at this time.' " Id., at 154, n. 14 (quoting Brief for Petitioners,
O. T. 1976, No. 75-104, p. 6, n. 6) (emphasis in Brief for Petitioners).

Though much like the claim in Shaw, the UJO claim failed because the
UJO district adhered to traditional districting practices. See 430 U. S.,
at 168 (opinion of White, J., joined by Rehnquist and Stevens, JJ.)
("[W]e think it . . . permissible for a State, employing sound districting
principles such as compactness and population equality, . . . [to] creat[e]
districts that will afford fair representation to the members of those racial
groups who are sufficiently numerous and whose residential patterns afford the opportunity of creating districts in which they will be in the
majority.") (emphasis added).

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
In adopting districting plans, however, States do not treatpeople as individuals. Apportionment schemes, by their

very nature, assemble people in groups. States do not as-sign voters to districts based on merit or achievement,
standards States might use in hiring employees or engagingcontractors. Rather, legislators classify voters in groups--
by economic, geographical, political, or social characteris-tics--and then "reconcile the competing claims of [these]
groups." Davis v. Bandemer, 478 U. S. 109, 147 (1986)(

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment).That ethnicity defines some of these groups is a political reality. Until now, no constitutional infirmity has beenseen in districting Irish or Italian voters together, for example, so long as the delineation does not abandon fa-miliar apportionment practices. See

supra, at 944-945. IfChinese-Americans and Russian-Americans may seek and

secure group recognition in the delineation of voting dis-tricts, then African-Americans should not be dissimilarly
treated. Otherwise, in the name of equal protection, wewould shut out "the very minority group whose history

in the United States gave birth to the Equal Protec-tion Clause." See

Shaw, 509 U. S., at 679 (Stevens, J.,dissenting).

B
Under the Court's approach, judicial review of the sameintensity, i. e., strict scrutiny, is in order once it is determined that an apportionment is predominantly motivated byrace. It matters not at all, in this new regime, whether the
apportionment dilutes or enhances minority voting strength.As very recently observed, however, "[t]here is no moral or

12 Race-conscious practices a State may elect to pursue, of course, are
not as limited as those it may be required to pursue. See Voinovich v.
Quilter, 507 U. S. 146, 156 (1993) ("[F]ederal courts may not order the
creation of majority-minority districts unless necessary to remedy a violation of federal law. But that does not mean that the State's powers are
similarly limited. Quite the opposite is true . . . .") (citation omitted).

constitutional equivalence between a policy that is designed
to perpetuate a caste system and one that seeks to eradicate
racial subordination." Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pen~ a,
ante, at 243 (Stevens, J., dissenting).

Special circumstances justify vigilant judicial inspection to
protect minority voters--circumstances that do not apply to
majority voters. A history of exclusion from state politics
left racial minorities without clout to extract provisions for
fair representation in the lawmaking forum. See supra, at
936-938. The equal protection rights of minority voters thus
could have remained unrealized absent the Judiciary's close
surveillance. Cf. United States v. Carolene Products Co.,
304 U. S. 144, 153, n. 4 (1938) (referring to the "more searching judicial inquiry" that may properly attend classifications
adversely affecting "discrete and insular minorities"). The
majority, by definition, encounters no such blockage. White
voters in Georgia do not lack means to exert strong pressure
on their state legislators. The force of their numbers is
itself a powerful determiner of what the legislature will
do that does not coincide with perceived majority interests.

State legislatures like Georgia's today operate under federal constraints imposed by the Voting Rights Act--constraints justified by history and designed by Congress to
make once-subordinated people free and equal citizens. But
these federal constraints do not leave majority voters in need
of extraordinary judicial solicitude. The Attorney General,
who administers the Voting Rights Act's preclearance requirements, is herself a political actor. She has a duty to
enforce the law Congress passed, and she is no doubt aware
of the political cost of venturing too far to the detriment of
majority voters. Majority voters, furthermore, can press
the State to seek judicial review if the Attorney General
refuses to preclear a plan that the voters favor. Finally,
the Act is itself a political measure, subject to modification
in the political process.

C
The Court's disposition renders redistricting perilous workfor state legislatures. Statutory mandates and political realities may require States to consider race when drawingdistrict lines. See

supra, at 935. But today's decision is acounterforce; it opens the way for federal litigation if "traditional . . . districting principles" arguably were accorded lessweight than race. See

ante, at 916. Genuine attention totraditional districting practices and avoidance of bizarre configurations seemed, under Shaw, to provide a safe harbor.See 509 U. S., at 647 ("[T]raditional districting principles
such as compactness, contiguity, and respect for political sub-divisions . . . are objective factors that may serve to defeat
a claim that a district has been gerrymandered on raciallines."). In view of today's decision, that is no longer the
case.Only after litigation--under either the Voting Rights Act,
the Court's new Miller standard, or both--will States nowbe assured that plans conscious of race are safe. Federal
judges in large numbers may be drawn into the fray. Thisenlargement of the judicial role is unwarranted. The reapportionment plan that resulted from Georgia's political proc-ess merited this Court's approbation, not its condemnation.
Accordingly, I dissent.

951OCTOBER TERM, 1994
Per Curiam

NETHERLAND, WARDEN v. TUGGLE
on application to vacate stay of execution

No. A-209. Decided September 1, 1995
On June 29, 1995, the Court of Appeals vacated the District Court's grant

of habeas relief to respondent Tuggle, finding all of his constitutional
claims meritless. However, the court stayed the issuance of its mandate and granted Tuggle a 30-day stay of execution, pending the filing
of a timely petition for certiorari in this Court. It later extended the
stay for the full 90 days allowed to file a certiorari petition.

Held: The stay of execution was improvidently granted and is vacated,

provided that it shall remain in effect until September 20, 1995, to allow
Tuggle's counsel time to seek a further stay in this Court. Since the
Court of Appeals' actions were taken by summary order without opinion
or discussion, there is no indication that the court attempted to undertake the three-part inquiry required by Barefoot v. Estelle, 463 U. S.
880, 895-896. This Court has already rejected the Court of Appeals'
apparent belief that a capital defendant as a matter of right is entitled
to a stay of execution until he has filed a certiorari petition in due
course. E. g., Autry v. Estelle, 464 U. S. 1, 2.

Stay vacated.

Per Curiam.
Applicant asks that we vacate a stay of execution grantedTuggle by the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. Because we agree with applicant that the stay was improvi-dently entered, we grant his application to vacate, provided
that the stay shall remain in effect until September 20, 1995,to allow Tuggle's counsel opportunity to seek a further stay
in this Court.On June 29, 1995, the Court of Appeals issued an opinion
vacating the District Court's grant of habeas relief, finding
all of Tuggle's constitutional claims to be without merit.
Tuggle v. Thompson, 57 F. 3d 1356. The court stayed the
issuance of its mandate on August 2, however, and grantedTuggle a 30-day stay of execution pending the filing of a

timely petition for certiorari in this Court; then on August

Stevens, J., dissenting
25 it extended the stay of execution for the full 90 daysallowed to file a certiorari petition in this Court.

Both actions of the court were taken by summary orderwithout opinion or discussion. Nothing indicates that the
Court of Appeals even attempted to undertake the threepart inquiry required by our decision in Barefoot v. Estelle,463 U. S. 880, 895-896 (1983). See also

Maggio v. Williams,
464 U. S. 46, 48 (1983) (per curiam); Autry v. Estelle, 464U. S. 1, 2-3 (1983)

(per curiam). There is no hint that the
court found that "four Members of th[is] Court would con-sider the underlying issue sufficiently meritorious for the

grant of certiorari" or that "a significant possibility of rever-sal" existed.

Barefoot, supra, at 895. We think the inescapable conclusion is that the Court of Appeals mistakenly
believed that a capital defendant as a matter of right was
entitled to a stay of execution until he has filed a petition for
certiorari in due course. But this view was rejected in
Autry, supra, at 2, and Maggio, supra, at 48.

Accordingly, the application to vacate the stay of execution
is granted.

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins,
dissenting.

Because there is no support in the record for the conclusion that the Court of Appeals abused its discretion when it
granted a stay of execution to enable respondent Tuggle to
file a petition for certiorari, I respectfully dissent. The fact
that the respondent has substantial grounds for challenging
the constitutionality of his death sentence is demonstrated
both by the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus by the District Court and by the 19-page opinion filed by the Court of
Appeals. Tuggle v. Thompson, 57 F. 3d 1356 (CA4 1995).
Promptly after that opinion was announced, respondent filed
a motion for a stay of execution supported by an explanation
of why "the three-part inquiry," ante this page, described in
Barefoot v. Estelle, 463 U. S. 880, 895-896 (1983), warranted

that relief. It is disrespectful to the Court of Appeals toassume that its grant of that motion did not implicitly endorse the reasoning in respondent's moving papers.The stay of execution would merely have given respondent
the opportunity to seek the review in this Court that hasbeen authorized by Congress and our Rules. In my opinion
it is both unwise and unfair to require a death row inmatewho has acted diligently at all stages of his litigation to prepare and file a petition raising substantial claims morepromptly than other litigants. I would deny the warden's
application.

Justice Souter would deny the application to vacate stayof execution.

Justice Breyer, for reasons stated in the first paragraphof

Justice Stevens' dissent, votes to deny the application.

Justice Scalia, concurring.
Last Term's decision in Madsen v. Women's Health Center, Inc.,512 U. S. 753 (1994), has damaged the First Amendment more

quickly and more severely than I feared. In this case the NewJersey courts asserted the power to enjoin residential picketing

Scalia, J., concurring1110
by antiabortion demonstrators that was explicitly found to havebeen peaceful and in violation of no state statute or rule of common law. It is one thing for the courts to enforce by injunctiona general, content-neutral state law (civil or criminal) against
all residential picketing, or to enjoin particular individuals fromcontinuing residential picketing that they have conducted in an
unlawful manner (e. g., with the accompaniment of violence). Itis quite another thing for the courts to enjoin particular individuals from conducting lawful residential picketing that they haveconducted in a lawful manner in the past. That is an unconstitutional prior restraint.Respondents are Elrick Murray, an obstetrician-gynecologist
who performs abortions, and his wife. The two petitionersplanned a demonstration at respondents' residence on Sunday,
January 20, 1991. On the appointed day, they and 56 other pick-eters met two policemen near respondents' house; received instruction from the policemen in basic picketing protocol; and wereescorted to the sidewalk running in front of respondents' house
and 10 neighboring houses. The protesters, carrying signs,walked in a single-file loop on the sidewalk past respondents'
house; the picketing lasted about an hour, and "[n]o instances oftrespass, violence or disorderly conduct were reported." App. to
Pet. for Cert. 90a (App.).In February 1991, respondents filed suit against petitioners and
others in state court, seeking damages and injunctive relief forvarious common-law torts: invasion of privacy (including interference with the use and enjoyment of respondents' residence), inten-tional infliction of emotional distress, interference with contractual relations, and others. The Chancery Division of the trialcourt entered a temporary restraining order. After a hearing on
the merits, the trial court denied respondents damages on theground that respondents had not made out any of their tort
claims. See id., at 92a-97a. The court then went on to makethe following rulings, which converted the proceeding from a tort
suit for damages and injunctive relief into a proceeding for imposi-tion of a judicial prior restraint:

"In addition to these claims, this court must also considerequitable principles when determining the appropriateness of
injunctive relief."Plaintiffs have a privacy interest irrespective of their
potential tort claim. . . .

"It can operate to limit First Amendment rights, evenwhere the intrusion is not tresspatory [sic] or otherwise
obstructed."The Court of equity has the inherent authority to balance
that interest against First Amendment rights."In other words, this court does not accept defendants'
position that no injunction can issue unless a crime or anexpressed tort has been committed." Id., at 97a (emphases
added; citations omitted).
The court then "balanced" the equities and, on the strength ofFrisby v. Schultz, 487 U. S. 474 (1988), found that respondents'

interests in residential privacy justified an injunction restraining"defendants and all persons in active concert or participation with
them . . . from picketing in any form . . . within 300 feet" ofrespondents' home. App. 106a.

The Appellate Division and the New Jersey Supreme Courtaffirmed. When petitioners sought certiorari we granted their
petition, vacated the judgment, and remanded for reconsiderationin light of our decision in Madsen. See Lawson v. Murray, 513
U. S. 802 (1994). On remand, the New Jersey Supreme Courtaffirmed the trial court's injunction in part and modified it in
part. The court acknowledged (as it had stated even more clearlyin its first opinion) that the injunction was "not imposed to remedy unlawful conduct," 138 N. J. 206, 225, 649 A. 2d 1253, 1263(1994), but rejected petitioners' claim that the injunction therefore
constituted an invalid prior restraint. In the alternative, thecourt relied on an asserted "captive audience" exception to the
prior restraint doctrine. See id., at 226, 649 A. 2d, at 1263.Although I dissented in Madsen, I do not believe that the opinion for the Court in that case "approve[d] issuance of an injunctionagainst speech . . . even when there has been found no violation,
or threatened violation, of a law." 512 U. S., at 804 (Scalia, J.,dissenting) (emphasis in original). To the contrary, the Court did
obeisance to the venerable principle that "[i]njunctions . . . areremedies imposed for violations (or threatened violations) of a
legislative or judicial decree," id., at 764 (citing United States v.W. T. Grant Co., 345 U. S. 629 (1953)), no matter how little that
principle was honored in application. See also 512 U. S., at 765("[I]njunctions . . . afford more precise relief than a statute where
a violation of the law has already occurred"); id., at 765, n. 3

Scalia, J., concurring1110
("Under general equity principles, an injunction issues only ifthere is a showing that the defendant has violated, or imminently
will violate, some provision of statutory or common law, and thatthere is a cognizable danger of recurrent violation") (internal quotation marks omitted).The Federal Constitution does not, of course, directly require
that an injunction issue only in such circumstances. But whereinjunctions that prohibit speech are concerned, the Free Speech
and Free Press Clauses of the First Amendment impose thatrequirement indirectly. All speech-restricting injunctions are
prior restraints in the literal sense of " `administrative and judicialorders forbidding certain communications when issued in advance
of the time that such communications are to occur.' " Alexanderv. United States, 509 U. S. 544, 550 (1993) (emphasis deleted).
Precedent shows that a speech-restricting "injunction" that is notissued as a remedy for an adjudicated or impending violation of
law is also a prior restraint in the condemnatory sense, that is, aprior restraint of the sort prohibited by the First Amendment.

In Organization for a Better Austin v. Keefe, 402 U. S. 415(1971), the state courts enjoined the petitioner from distributing
literature or picketing anywhere within the city limits, on thesame ground that the New Jersey courts expressed here: "[T]he
public policy of the [State] strongly favored protection of theprivacy of home and family" from the speech activities. Cf. 138
N. J., at 224, 649 A. 2d, at 1263 ("[T]he injunction was enteredpursuant to the [trial] court's authority to grant equitable relief
to enforce a valid public policy of this State" protecting residentialprivacy). We held the injunction to be an unconstitutional prior
restraint, reasoning that "the injunction operates, not to redressalleged private wrongs, but to suppress [speech] on the basis of
previous publications." 402 U. S., at 418-419 (emphasis added).Keefe relied on Near v. Minnesota ex rel. Olson, 283 U. S. 697
(1931), the foundation case in this area, where we struck downa state-court order that enjoined a newspaper from publishing
malicious, scandalous, or defamatory material. We found theorder to be an unconstitutional prior restraint, observing that the
statute that authorized the order "is not aimed at the redress ofindividual or private wrongs," id., at 709, and that "the object of
the statute is not punishment, . . . but suppression," id., at 711.See also id., at 715; Hirsh v. Atlanta, 495 U. S. 927 (1990)
(Stevens, J., concurring in denial of stay) (distinguishing injunc515ord$$1x 08-18-98 10:07:57 PGT*ORD1BV (Bound Volume)

tive relief against "a class of persons who have persistently andrepeatedly engaged in unlawful conduct" from "a naked prior restraint against . . . a group that did not have a similar history ofillegal conduct").

The very episode before us illustrates the reasons for this dis-tinction between remedial injunctions and unconstitutional prior
restraints. The danger that speech-restricting injunctions mayserve as a powerful means to suppress disfavored views is obvious
enough even when they are based on a completed or impendingviolation of law. Once such a basis has been found, later speech
may be quashed, or not quashed, in the discretion of a singleofficial, who necessarily knows the content and viewpoint of the
speech subject to the injunction; the injunction is enforceablethrough civil contempt, a summary process without the constitutional protection of a jury trial; and the only defense available tothe enjoined party is factual compliance with the injunction, not
unconstitutionality, see In re Felmeister, 95 N. J. 431, 445, 471A. 2d 775, 782 (1984); In re Carton, 48 N. J. 9, 16, 222 A. 2d
92, 96 (1966). But the threat to the First Amendment becomespositively alarming when violation of the law is not even a necessary prelude to this expansive discretion--when the defendant'sprior speech (and proposed future speech) has been expressly
found not to constitute a crime or common-law tort, and the onlybasis for the injunction is a nebulous "public policy" of the State
enforced by an inherent equitable power. See 138 N. J., at 225,649 A. 2d, at 1263. This is by definition a policy of enjoining in
advance speech that the State does not punish after the fact--that is to say, a policy narrowly tailored to nothing but the suppression of lawful speech. And even that damning assessmentassumes, of course, that such a "public policy" even exists in state
law, which is highly questionable here. The New Jersey courtshave given equitable relief against residential picketing not violative of state law only in this case and another recent case involv-ing abortion protesters. See Boffard v. Barnes, 136 N. J. 32, 642
A. 2d 338 (1994).* The temptation in cases involving issues of

*In K-T Marine, Inc. v. Dockbuilders Local Union 1456, 251 N. J. Super.107, 597 A. 2d 540 (1991), the Appellate Division affirmed an injunction
against residential picketing by a union. There, however, the injunction is-sued because the trial judge found that "tortious activity . . . had taken
place and would continue unless the court interceded." Id., at 110, 597A. 2d, at 542.

social controversy--precisely the cases where the First Amend-ment's protections are most needed--will always be for judges
to discern a "policy" against whatever-speech-looks-bad-at-the-moment.

Even our Madsen decision was, as I read it, unwilling to invitesuch consequences by cutting prior-restraint doctrine loose from
the requirement that injunctions be remedial. The prior-restraint argument advanced by petitioners in that case was summarily rejected in a footnote with the observation that

"[n]ot all injunctions that may incidentally affect expression. . . are `prior restraints' . . . . Here petitioners are not

prevented from expressing their message in any one ofseveral different ways; they are simply prohibited from expressing it within the . . . zone [covered by the injunction].Moreover, the injunction was issued not because of the content of petitioners' expression, . . . but because of their priorunlawful conduct." Madsen, 512 U. S., at 764, n. 2 (emphasis added).
The New Jersey Supreme Court read this footnote to mean thateven an injunction not imposed to remedy or prevent unlawful

conduct may nonetheless be valid, depending on an assessment of"factors" such as content neutrality and availability of alternative
channels of communication. See 138 N. J., at 221-226, 649 A. 2d,at 1261-1263. But such factors determine the validity of subsequent restraints, see, e. g., Simon & Schuster, Inc. v. Members ofN. Y. State Crime Victims Bd., 502 U. S. 105, 116 (1991); Ward v.
Rock Against Racism, 491 U. S. 781, 791 (1989), and to makethem conclusive of the validity of prior restraints as well would
destroy the doctrine that prior restraints are specially disfavored,see Patterson v. Colorado ex rel. Attorney General of Colo., 205
U. S. 454, 462 (1907) (Holmes, J.); Nebraska Press Assn. v. Stuart,427 U. S. 539, 598 (1976) (Brennan, J., concurring in judgment).
The presence of such validating factors is a necessary and suffi-cient condition for the constitutionality of a subsequent punishment, but merely a necessary condition for the constitutionalityof a prior restraint, which requires in addition that it be remedial. It is improper to attribute a different meaning to the am-biguous Madsen footnote, which after all appeared in an opinion
that elsewhere purported to honor the requirement that speech-restricting injunctions be remedial.

The principal ground for the decision below, then, does notapply Madsen but expands it, and contracts the First Amendment
pari passu. I think it of vital importance that Madsen quicklybe limited to what it said, rather than what it did. I nonetheless
do not vote to grant certiorari here, for two reasons: The alterna-tive ground for the court's decision (existence of a "captive audience" exception to the doctrine of prior restraint), while a highlyquestionable basis for a discretionary injunction power, presents
no clear conflict with the decisions of other courts and could pre-vent us from reaching the Madsen issue. And clarification of
Madsen is in any event unlikely to occur in another case involvingthe currently disfavored class of antiabortion protesters. Accordingly, I concur in the denial of certiorari.

Justice Thomas, with whom Justice O'Connor joins,dissenting.

Motivated by a desire to improve the attractiveness of its down-town region, the Atlanta City Council passed an ordinance requiring certain existing surface parking lots to include landscapedareas equal to at least 10% of the paved area and to have at least
one tree for every eight parking spaces. The ordinance coverssome 350 parking lots; petitioners estimate that compliance with
the landscaping requirements will cost approximately $12,500 perlot, for a total of $4,375,000. Additionally, parking lot owners will
lose revenue due to lost parking spaces and lost advertising dol-lars: The trees allegedly will obscure existing advertising signs
and cause petitioners to lose contracts worth about $1,636,000.Petitioners sought injunctive and declaratory relief on the
ground that the Atlanta ordinance was an uncompensated takingof property in violation of the Fifth Amendment. The state trial

Thomas, J., dissenting1116
court ruled in favor of the city. In a divided opinion, the Su-preme Court of Georgia affirmed. 264 Ga. 764, 450 S. E. 2d 200
(1994). The court held that the ordinance was neither a physicalnor a regulatory taking. The court relied on Agins v. City of
Tiburon, 447 U. S. 255 (1980), to conclude that the ordinance wasconstitutional because it "advances legitimate governmental interests and leaves the plaintiffs with an economically viable use intheir property." 264 Ga., at 766, n. 3, 450 S. E. 2d, at 203, n. 3.
The court distinguished Dolan v. City of Tigard, 512 U. S. 374(1994), which requires a showing of rough proportionality between
the conditions imposed and the impact of the owner's develop-ment, on the ground that although the city of Tigard had not made
an " `individualized determination that the required dedication isrelated both in nature and extent to the impact of the development,' " 264 Ga., at 766, n. 3, 450 S. E. 2d, at 203, n. 3 (quotingDolan, supra, at 391), the city of Atlanta had made a "legislative
determination" with regard to many landowners, 264 Ga., at 766,n. 3, 450 S. E. 2d, at 203, n. 3, thus placing this case outside the
reach of Dolan.The lower courts are in conflict over whether Dolan's test for
property regulation should be applied in cases where the allegedtaking occurs through an Act of the legislature. In addition to
the court below, at least one other court has relied upon the"legislative" character of state action to conclude that Dolan was
inapposite and that the less stringent Agins standard should beapplied. See Harris v. Wichita, 862 F. Supp. 287, 294 (D. Kan.
1994). Other courts, however, have applied Dolan to cases in-volving alleged legislative regulatory takings. In Trimen Development Co. v. King Cty., 124 Wash. 2d 261, 877 P. 2d 187 (1994),the Washington Supreme Court applied Dolan to an ordinance
similar to the one at issue here. A King County Council ordi-nance required that developers seeking to build housing either
dedicate land for public parks or pay a fee. Despite the fact thatthe ordinance was clearly a "legislative enactment," the court
applied Dolan's rough proportionality test. 124 Wash. 2d, at 274,877 P. 2d, at 194. See also Manocherian v. Lennox Hill Hospital,
84 N. Y. 2d 385, 393, 643 N. E. 2d 479, 483 (1994), cert. denied, 514U. S. 1109 (1995) (applying Dolan to alleged legislative taking).

It is hardly surprising that some courts have applied Dolan'srough proportionality test even when considering a legislative
enactment. It is not clear why the existence of a taking should

turn on the type of governmental entity responsible for the tak-ing. A city council can take property just as well as a planning
commission can. Moreover, the general applicability of the ordi-nance should not be relevant in a takings analysis. If Atlanta
had seized several hundred homes in order to build a freeway,there would be no doubt that Atlanta had taken property. The
distinction between sweeping legislative takings and particular-ized administrative takings appears to be a distinction without a
constitutional difference.Although Dolan purports to be an exception to Agins, the logic
of these two cases appears to point in different directions. Thelower courts should not have to struggle to make sense of this
tension in our case law. In the past, the confused nature of someof our takings case law and the fact-specific nature of takings
claims has led us to grant certiorari in takings cases without theexistence of a conflict. See Dolan, supra, at 383 (observing that
certiorari was granted because the Oregon Supreme Court alleg-edly had misapplied Nollan v. California Coastal Comm'n, 483
U. S. 825 (1987)). Where, as here, there is a conflict, the reasonsfor granting certiorari are all the more compelling.

Because the petition poses a substantial federal question con-cerning regulatory takings and because there is confusion in the
lower courts, I would grant certiorari.

PART III. JURISDICTION ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI
Rule 10. Considerations Governing Review onCertiorari

Review on a writ of certiorari is not a matter of right, butof judicial discretion. A petition for a writ of certiorari will
be granted only for compelling reasons. The following, al-though neither controlling nor fully measuring the Court's
discretion, indicate the character of the reasons the Courtconsiders:

515us3urul 07-10-97 16:49:00 PGT * USRULES
1204 RULES OF THE SUPREME COURT

(a) a United States court of appeals has entered adecision in conflict with the decision of another United

States court of appeals on the same important matter;has decided an important federal question in a way that
conflicts with a decision by a state court of last resort;or has so far departed from the accepted and usual
course of judicial proceedings, or sanctioned such a de-parture by a lower court, as to call for an exercise of
this Court's supervisory power;(b) a state court of last resort has decided an important federal question in a way that conflicts with thedecision of another state court of last resort or of a
United States court of appeals;(c) a state court or a United States court of appeals
has decided an important question of federal law thathas not been, but should be, settled by this Court, or
has decided an important federal question in a way thatconflicts with relevant decisions of this Court.

A petition for a writ of certiorari is rarely granted when theasserted error consists of erroneous factual findings or the
misapplication of a properly stated rule of law.
Rule 11. Certiorari to a United States Court of AppealsBefore Judgment

A petition for a writ of certiorari to review a case pendingin a United States court of appeals, before judgment is entered in that court, will be granted only upon a showing thatthe case is of such imperative public importance as to justify
deviation from normal appellate practice and to requireimmediate determination in this Court. See 28 U. S. C.

$ 2101(e).
Rule 12. Review on Certiorari: How Sought; Parties

1. Except as provided in paragraph 2 of this Rule, the peti-tioner shall file 40 copies of a petition for a writ of certiorari,

prepared as required by Rule 33.1, and shall pay the Rule38(a) docket fee.

515us3urul 07-10-97 16:49:00 PGT * USRULES

1205RULES OF THE SUPREME COURT
2. A petitioner proceeding in forma pauperis under Rule39 shall file an original and 10 copies of a petition for a writ

of certiorari prepared as required by Rule 33.2, togetherwith an original and 10 copies of the motion for leave to
proceed in forma pauperis. A copy of the motion shall pre-cede and be attached to each copy of the petition. An inmate confined in an institution, if proceeding in forma pauperis and not represented by counsel, need file only an
original petition and motion.

3. Whether prepared under Rule 33.1 or Rule 33.2, thepetition shall comply in all respects with Rule 14 and shall

4. Parties interested jointly, severally, or otherwise in a
judgment may petition separately for a writ of certiorari; orany two or more may join in a petition. A party not shown

on the petition as joined therein at the time the petition isfiled may not later join in that petition. When two or more
judgments are sought to be reviewed on a writ of certiorarito the same court and involve identical or closely related
questions, a single petition for a writ of certiorari covering
all the judgments suffices. A petition for a writ of certiorarimay not be joined with any other pleading, except that any

motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis shall beattached.

5. No more than 30 days after a case has been placed onthe docket, a respondent seeking to file a conditional crosspetition (i. e., a cross-petition that otherwise would be un-timely) shall file, with proof of service as required by Rule
29, 40 copies of the cross-petition prepared as required by
Rule 33.1, except that a cross-petitioner proceeding in forma
pauperis under Rule 39 shall comply with Rule 12.2. The
cross-petition shall comply in all respects with this Rule and
Rule 14, except that material already reproduced in the ap515us3urul 07-10-97 16:49:00 PGT * USRULES

pendix to the opening petition need not be reproduced again.A cross-petitioning respondent shall pay the Rule 38(a)

docket fee or submit a motion for leave to proceed in forma
pauperis. The cover of the cross-petition shall indicate
clearly that it is a conditional cross-petition. The cross-petition then will be placed on the docket, subject to the

provisions of Rule 13.4. It is the cross-petitioner's duty tonotify all cross-respondents promptly, on a form supplied by
the Clerk, of the date of filing, the date the cross-petition
was placed on the docket, and the docket number of thecross-petition. The notice shall be served as required by

Rule 29. A cross-petition for a writ of certiorari may notbe joined with any other pleading, except that any motion
for leave to proceed in forma pauperis shall be attached.The time to file a cross-petition will not be extended.

6. All parties to the proceeding in the court whose judg-ment is sought to be reviewed are deemed parties entitled
to file documents in this Court, unless the petitioner notifies
the Clerk of this Court in writing of the petitioner's beliefthat one or more of the parties below have no interest in the

outcome of the petition. A copy of such notice shall beserved as required by Rule 29 on all parties to the proceeding below. A party noted as no longer interested may re-main a party by notifying the Clerk promptly, with service
on the other parties, of an intention to remain a party. All
parties other than the petitioner are considered respondents,but any respondent who supports the position of a petitioner

shall meet the petitioner's time schedule for filing docu-ments, except that a response supporting the petition shall
be filed within 20 days after the case is placed on the docket,and that time will not be extended. Parties who file no document will not qualify for any relief from this Court.7. The clerk of the court having possession of the record
shall keep it until notified by the Clerk of this Court to certify and transmit it. In any document filed with this Court,
a party may cite or quote from the record, even if it has
not been transmitted to this Court. When requested by the
Clerk of this Court to certify and transmit the record, or any

transmit therewith a numbered list specifically identifyingeach document transmitted. If the record, or stipulated portions, have been printed for the use of the court below, thatprinted record, plus the proceedings in the court below, may
be certified as the record unless one of the parties or theClerk of this Court requests otherwise. The record may
consist of certified copies, but if the lower court is of theview that original documents of any kind should be seen by

Unless otherwise provided by law, a petition for a writof certiorari to review a judgment in any case, civil or criminal, entered by a state court of last resort or a United Statescourt of appeals (including the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces) is timely when it is filed withthe Clerk of this Court within 90 days after entry of the
judgment. A petition for a writ of certiorari seeking reviewof a judgment of a lower state court that is subject to discretionary review by the state court of last resort is timelywhen it is filed with the Clerk within 90 days after entry of
the order denying discretionary review.2. The Clerk will not file any petition for a writ of certiorari that is jurisdictionally out of time. See, e. g., 28U. S. C. $ 2101(c).

3. The time to file a petition for a writ of certiorari runsfrom the date of entry of the judgment or order sought to be
reviewed, and not from the issuance date of the mandate (orits equivalent under local practice). But if a petition for rehearing is timely filed in the lower court by any party, thetime to file the petition for a writ of certiorari for all parties
(whether or not they requested rehearing or joined in thepetition for rehearing) runs from the date of the denial of
the petition for rehearing or, if the petition for rehearing isgranted, the subsequent entry of judgment. A suggestion

this Rule unless so treated by the United States court ofappeals.

4. A cross-petition for a writ of certiorari is timely whenit is filed with the Clerk as provided in paragraphs 1, 3, and
5 of this Rule, or in Rule 12.5. However, a conditionalcross-petition (which except for Rule 12.5 would be untimely)
will not be granted unless another party's timely petition fora writ of certiorari is granted.

5. For good cause, a Justice may extend the time to file apetition for a writ of certiorari for a period not exceeding 60
days. An application to extend the time to file shall set outthe basis for jurisdiction in this Court, identify the judgment
sought to be reviewed, include a copy of the opinion and anyorder respecting rehearing, and set out specific reasons why
an extension of time is justified. The application must bereceived by the Clerk at least 10 days before the date the
petition is due, except in extraordinary circumstances. Forthe time and manner of presenting the application, see Rules
21, 22, 30, and 33.2. An application to extend the time tofile a petition for a writ of certiorari is not favored.

$ 2241(b), is an adjudication on the merits, and therefore doesnot preclude further application to another court for the relief sought.5. The Clerk will distribute the documents to the Court
for its consideration when a brief in opposition under subpar-agraph 3(b) of this Rule has been filed, when a response
under subparagraph 4(b) has been ordered and filed, when
the time to file has expired, or when the right to file has been
expressly waived.

6. If the Court orders the case set for argument, the Clerk
will notify the parties whether additional briefs are required,

jurisdictional statement, but the brief may not raise addi-tional questions or change the substance of the questions
already presented in those documents. At its option, how-ever, the Court may consider a plain error not among the

12, or to the record, e. g., Record 12.

(h) A summary of the argument, suitably paragraphed.
The summary should be a clear and concise condensation of

( j) A conclusion specifying with particularity the relief
the party seeks.

2. A brief on the merits for a respondent or an appellee

writ of certiorari, motion to dismiss or affirm, or any appen-dix to the foregoing, that was prepared as required by Rule
33.1, need not be reproduced again in the joint appendix.The petitioner or appellant shall serve three copies of the
joint appendix on each of the other parties to the proceedingas required by Rule 29.

or postponing consideration of jurisdiction, shall serve on therespondent or appellee a designation of parts of the record
to be included in the joint appendix. Within 10 days afterreceiving the designation, a respondent or appellee who considers the parts of the record so designated insufficient shallserve on the petitioner or appellant a designation of additional parts to be included in the joint appendix, and thepetitioner or appellant shall include the parts so designated.
If the Court has permitted the respondent or appellee to
proceed in forma pauperis, the petitioner or appellant mayseek by motion to be excused from printing portions of the

record the petitioner or appellant considers unnecessary. In

515us3urul 07-10-97 16:49:00 PGT * USRULES
1230 RULES OF THE SUPREME COURT
making these designations, counsel should include only thosematerials the Court should examine; unnecessary designations should be avoided. The record is on file with the Clerkand available to the Justices, and counsel may refer in briefs
and in oral argument to relevant portions of the record notincluded in the joint appendix.

3. When the joint appendix is filed, the petitioner or appel-lant immediately shall file with the Clerk a statement of the
cost of printing 50 copies and shall serve a copy of the statement on each of the other parties as required by Rule 29.Unless the parties agree otherwise, the cost of producing

the joint appendix shall be paid initially by the petitioner orappellant; but a petitioner or appellant who considers that
parts of the record designated by the respondent or appelleeare unnecessary for the determination of the issues presented may so advise the respondent or appellee, who thenshall advance the cost of printing the additional parts, unless
the Court or a Justice otherwise fixes the initial allocation of
the costs. The cost of printing the joint appendix is taxedas a cost in the case, but if a party unnecessarily causes matter to be included in the joint appendix or prints excessivecopies, the Court may impose these costs on that party.

4. (a) On the parties' request, the Clerk may allow prepa-ration of the joint appendix to be deferred until after the
briefs have been filed. In that event, the petitioner or appellant shall file the joint appendix no more than 14 daysafter receiving the brief for the respondent or appellee. The

provisions of paragraphs 1, 2, and 3 of this Rule shall befollowed, except that the designations referred to therein
shall be made by each party when that party's brief isserved. Deferral of the joint appendix is not favored.

(b) If the deferred method is used, the briefs on the meritsmay refer to the pages of the record. In that event, the
joint appendix shall include in brackets on each page thereof
the page number of the record where that material may be
found. A party wishing to refer directly to the pages of the
joint appendix may serve and file copies of its brief prepared
as required by Rule 33.2 within the time provided by Rule

copies of the brief prepared as required by Rule 33.1 contain-ing references to the pages of the joint appendix in place of,
or in addition to, the initial references to the pages of therecord, shall be served and filed. No other change may be
made in the brief as initially served and filed, except thattypographical errors may be corrected.

5. The joint appendix shall be prefaced by a table of contents showing the parts of the record that it contains, in theorder in which the parts are set out, with references to the

pages of the joint appendix at which each part begins. Therelevant docket entries shall be set out after the table of
contents, followed by the other parts of the record in chrono-logical order. When testimony contained in the reporter's
transcript of proceedings is set out in the joint appendix, thepage of the transcript at which the testimony appears shall
be indicated in brackets immediately before the statement
that is set out. Omissions in the transcript or in any otherdocument printed in the joint appendix shall be indicated by

asterisks. Immaterial formal matters (e. g., captions, sub-scriptions, acknowledgments) shall be omitted. A question
and its answer may be contained in a single paragraph.6. Exhibits designated for inclusion in the joint appendix
may be contained in a separate volume or volumes suitably
indexed. The transcript of a proceeding before an adminis-trative agency, board, commission, or officer used in an action

in a district court or court of appeals is regarded as an ex-hibit for the purposes of this paragraph.

7. The Court, on its own motion or that of a party, maydispense with the requirement of a joint appendix and may
permit a case to be heard on the original record (with suchcopies of the record, or relevant parts thereof, as the Court
may require) or on the appendix used in the court below, if
it conforms to the requirements of this Rule.

8. For good cause, the time limits specified in this Rule

Rule 35. Death, Substitution, and Revivor; Public

Officers

1. If a party dies after filing a petition for a writ of certiorari to this Court, or after filing a notice of appeal, the
authorized representative of the deceased party may appear
and, on motion, be substituted as a party. If the representative does not voluntarily become a party, any other party
may suggest the death on the record and, on motion, seek an
order requiring the representative to become a party within
a designated time. If the representative then fails to become a party, the party so moving, if a respondent or appellee, is entitled to have the petition for a writ of certiorari or
the appeal dismissed, and if a petitioner or appellant, is entitled to proceed as in any other case of nonappearance by a
respondent or appellee. If the substitution of a representative of the deceased is not made within six months after the
death of the party, the case shall abate.

2. Whenever a case cannot be revived in the court whose
judgment is sought to be reviewed, because the deceased
party's authorized representative is not subject to that
court's jurisdiction, proceedings will be conducted as this
Court may direct.

3. When a public officer who is a party to a proceeding in
this Court in an official capacity dies, resigns, or otherwise
ceases to hold office, the action does not abate and any
successor in office is automatically substituted as a party.
The parties shall notify the Clerk in writing of any such
successions. Proceedings following the substitution shall
be in the name of the substituted party, but any misnomer
not affecting substantial rights of the parties will be
disregarded.

4. A public officer who is a party to a proceeding in this
Court in an official capacity may be described as a party by
the officer's official title rather than by name, but the Court
may require the name to be added.

IN CHAMBERS

FOSTER, SHERIFF, et al. v. GILLIAM et al.

on application for stay
No. A-126. Decided August 17, 1995
South Carolina's application for relief from an order of the Court of Appeals, which refused to stay the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus to
respondent criminal defendants, is granted in part and denied in part.
Respondents claimed double jeopardy by reason of a second trial, which
was calendared after the first trial ended in a mistrial over respondents'
objection. After the second trial started, the District Court enjoined
its continuation and released respondents from custody. Nothing can
undo the interruption of the state trial, and therefore the District
Court's order staying those proceedings will not be stayed. However,
the State has met the traditional criteria for a stay of the enlargement
of a prisoner in a habeas proceeding. Therefore respondents' enlargement will be stayed pending disposition of the State's appeal from the
District Court's order.

Chief Justice Rehnquist, Circuit Justice.
The State of South Carolina seeks relief from an order of
the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in which that
court refused to stay the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus
to respondents, defendants in criminal proceedings in South
Carolina. The State asks that I stay the District Court's
order and allow the State to resume its prosecution of respondents, and stay the enlargement of respondents pending
appellate review of their habeas corpus petition.

Respondents were prosecuted in South Carolina state
court in 1994 on charges of murder and lynching. During
the trial, confusion and dispute arose over whether particular photographs that had been seen by the jury during a
luncheon recess had actually been admitted into evidence or

Opinion in Chambers
were merely marked for identification. The prosecuting at-torney's motion for a mistrial was granted by the trial court

over respondents' objection, and the trial court calendaredthe case for a second trial starting July 17, 1995. Between
the first and the second trial, the trial court denied a motion
by respondents to dismiss the charges on grounds of doublejeopardy, and the Supreme Court of South Carolina dismissed respondents' appeal without ruling on its merits.Respondents then sought habeas relief in federal court
under 28 U. S. C. $ 2254, and sought to enjoin the imminentsecond trial pending final disposition of their habeas petition.
On July 11, 1995, six days before the second trial was to
start, the District Court for the District of South Carolina
refused to issue an injunction, and a panel of the Court of
Appeals affirmed the District Court's determination four
days later, with one judge in dissent. On July 20, three days
into the trial, the Court of Appeals en banc granted respondents' request for a temporary restraining order, enjoined the
state proceedings until the District Court ruled on respondents' habeas petition, and ordered the District Court to rule
on the petition as expeditiously as possible. The State did
not apply for a stay of the Court of Appeals' order at this
time.

The very next day, the District Court, having held an
8-hour hearing to investigate respondents' double jeopardy
claim, granted respondents' petition for a writ of habeas corpus. (This order, though entered July 21, was not reduced
to writing for another week.) The District Court denied the
State's application to stay the issuance of the writ on July
31, and the Court of Appeals denied a similar application
on August 8. The State then made the application before
me now.

However debatable may have been the justification for the
Court of Appeals' July 20 order enjoining the continuation
of a state criminal trial that had already begun, the trial was
interrupted as of that date, and the State sought no relief in

Opinion in Chambers
this Court from the order of the Court of Appeals. NothingI do now, several weeks later, can undo the interruption of

the state trial, and I therefore decline to stay the DistrictCourt's order granting habeas relief to the extent that it
enjoins the resumption of the state trial proceedings.That portion of the District Court's order releasing respondents from custody, however, seems to me to stand on adifferent footing, and I believe that the State has met the
traditional criteria for a stay of the enlargement of a prisonerin a habeas corpus proceeding. The state trial court ruled
against respondents' double jeopardy claims on the merits.In

Arizona v. Washington, 434 U. S. 497 (1978), we held thatone claiming double jeopardy by reason of a second trial

must show that there was no "manifest necessity" for thetrial court to grant the State's mistrial motion. And we
stated that the trial court's judgment about the necessity isentitled to great deference, never more so than when the
judgment is based on an evaluation of such factors as theadmissibility of evidence, any prejudice caused by the introduction of such evidence, and the trial court's familiaritywith the jurors. Id., at 513-514. Washington indicates
that the State will be able to present at the least a substan-tial case on the merits on appeal, and the other traditional
factors in a stay analysis counsel in favor of continued cus-tody. See Hilton v. Braunskill, 481 U. S. 770, 777-778
(1987) (discussing the circumstances in which a stay of en-largement should be granted under Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure 23(c) and (d), which are virtually identical tothis Court's Rules 36.3(b) and 36.4). I will therefore stay
the enlargement of respondents under the District Court'sJuly 21 order pending disposition of the State's appeal from
that order (now set for argument before the en banc courton September 26) by the Court of Appeals.

Accordingly, the application for stay of enlargement isgranted, and the application is otherwise denied.

1304 OCTOBER TERM, 1994

Opinion in Chambers

PENRY v. TEXAS
on application for extension of time

No. A-180. Decided August 28, 1995
An application for extension of time in which to file a petition for a writ

of certiorari to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals is denied. The
reasons for an extension offered by counsel--a voluminous record below,
the breadth of errors committed below, and counsel of record's anticipated absence shortly before the filing date--fall short of what constitutes "good cause" to support such a disfavored application. All applicants would benefit from additional time to prepare a petition for
certiorari. It is inconceivable that counsel here could have filed their
375-page Court of Criminal Appeals' brief, detailing 132 allegations of
error, without acquiring considerable familiarity with the record. Counsel asked for reconsideration and thus had six months to review the
Court of Criminal Appeals' opinion. Finally, counsel's planned absences
should affect neither the degree of preparation afforded a client's case
nor the orderly administration of this Court's deadlines.

Justice Scalia, Circuit Justice.
I have before me an application for extension of time inwhich to file a petition for a writ of certiorari to the Court

of Criminal Appeals of Texas. Counsel seek a 59-day extension of the filing deadline "because of the voluminous recordbelow and the breadth of errors that were committed below

which warrant review by this Court." Counsel explain:"The petitioner's brief to the Court of Criminal Appeal[s] of
Texas discussed 132 points of error and is 375 pages inlength. The State's brief is 248 pages in length. The judgment affirming petitioner's conviction and death sentence is
76 pages with 6 additional pages of concurrences." The ap-plication offers one additional reason for the extension request: "[C]ounsel of record will be out of his office during theentire week before September 5, 1995--the day that the time
to file the petition will expire."Our Rules provide that "[a] petition for a writ of certiorari
to review a judgment in any case, civil or criminal, entered

Opinion in Chambers
by a state court of last resort, . . . shall be deemed in timewhen it is filed with the Clerk of this Court within 90 days

after the entry of the judgment," Rule 13.1, and that a Jus-tice may extend the time to file for up to 60 days "for good
cause shown," Rule 13.2. Our Rules specify, however, that
"[a]n application to extend the time to file a petition for awrit of certiorari is not favored." Rule 13.6.

I have made it clear that I take the rule of disfavor seri-ously. In

Madden v. Texas, 498 U. S. 1301 (1991) (opinion in
chambers), I considered four applications for extensions oftime in capital cases. Three of them sought an extension

because appellate counsel had withdrawn from the applicant's case (with no indication that the withdrawal could not
reasonably have been foreseen). Id., at 1302-1304. In the
fourth, the asserted reason was similar to that offered here:
Counsel needed additional time " `to ensure that the important constitutional issues in [the] case are properly researched and presented to this Court.' " Id., at 1302. At
that time, I expressed my view that "none of these applications, as an original matter, would meet the standard of `good
cause shown' for the granting of an extension." Id., at 1304.
I nonetheless granted extensions in the three cases where
counsel had withdrawn, primarily because I was a new Circuit Justice, and was reluctant to impose without notice a
standard more stringent, perhaps, than what the Fifth Circuit bar was accustomed to. I gave notice, however, that "I
shall not grant extensions in similar circumstances again."
Id., at 1305.

By now, counsel litigating in the Fifth Circuit ought to be
familiar with my view of what constitutes "good cause" to
support the disfavored application to extend the time to file
a petition for certiorari. See R. Stern, E. Gressman, S. Shapiro, & K. Geller, Supreme Court Practice $ 6.7 (7th ed.
1993). The reasons offered by counsel in this application fall
short. As I have previously observed, all applicants can
honestly claim that they would benefit from additional time

515us3IC4K 07-09-98 11:57:36 PAGES IC13PGT
1306 PENRY v. TEXAS

Opinion in Chambers
to prepare a petition for certiorari. Kleem v. INS, 479 U. S.1308 (1986) (opinion in chambers); see also Madden, supra,

at 1304. By their own account, counsel here filed a brief of375 pages, raising 132 assignments of error, in the Court of
Criminal Appeals; it is inconceivable that this could havebeen achieved without acquiring considerable familiarity
with the record, voluminous though it may be. Moreover,counsel sought rehearing below, and thus have had six
months to review the opinion of the Court of Criminal Ap-peals, which discussed in considerable detail the 132 allegations of error as it rejected each of them. Finally--andneedless to say--counsel's planned absences should affect
neither the degree of preparation afforded a client's case northe orderly administration of our deadlines.

This is indeed a capital case, but our Rules envision onlyone "good cause" standard. See 498 U. S., at 1304-1305.
Because the applicant here has failed to meet that standard,I deny the application for extension of time.

1307OCTOBER TERM, 1994
Opinion in Chambers

RODRIGUEZ v. TEXAS
on application for stay of execution of sentenceof death

No. 95-5650 (A-202). Decided August 31, 1995
An application for a stay of execution pending disposition of a petition for

writ of certiorari seeking direct review of the Texas Court of Criminal
Appeals' judgment is denied, without prejudice to its renewal at a later
date. There being no reason to believe that the certiorari petition will
not be disposed of well before the scheduled execution date, that date
is not likely to interfere with the petition's orderly processing. See
Cole v. Texas, 499 U. S. 1301.

Justice Scalia, Circuit Justice.
I have before me an application for a stay of execution
pending disposition of a petition for writ of certiorari to the
Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas. Petitioner seeks direct
review of that court's judgment, entered May 17, 1995, affirming his conviction and death sentence. The petition was
timely filed on August 15, 1995, and petitioner's application
states that he is scheduled to be executed on November 8,
1995.

I have said that "I will . . . in every capital case on direct
review, grant a stay of execution pending disposition by this
Court of the petition for certiorari." Cole v. Texas, 499 U. S.
1301 (1991). I have also made clear, however, that the purpose of such a stay is to prevent the execution date from
"interfer[ing] with the orderly processing of a petition on
direct review by this Court." Ibid. In the present case,
and at the present time, there is no reason to believe such
interference will occur. A petition for certiorari filed in this
Court on August 15 will ordinarily be disposed of well before
November 8.

1309OCTOBER TERM, 1994
Opinion in Chambers

McGRAW-HILL COS., INC. v. PROCTER &

GAMBLE CO. et al.

on application for stay
No. A-276. Decided September 21, 1995
An application to stay a District Court order restraining petitioner from

publishing a magazine article disclosing documents filed under seal with
that court is denied. Since it appears that the order was entered without notice to petitioner and was not supported by the findings required
by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(b), it can be assumed that the
court would have dissolved the order had petitioner so moved. Had it
refused to do so, the Court of Appeals would have had jurisdiction to
address the restraint's merits. Instead, petitioner filed an expedited
appeal, which the Court of Appeals dismissed on jurisdictional grounds.
The stay application addresses the merits of the District Court's order,
not the Court of Appeals' jurisdictional holding. Even if there is jurisdiction to pass on the order's merits, the wiser course is to give the
District Court an opportunity to find the relevant facts--since there is
a dispute over how petitioner acquired the documents--and allow both
it and the Court of Appeals to consider the merits of the First Amendment issue before it is addressed here.

Justice Stevens, Circuit Justice.
On September 19, 1995, petitioner, the publisher of Business Week magazine, filed with me in my capacity as Circuit
Justice for the Sixth Circuit a hastily prepared document
entitled "Application to Stay Restraining Order Pending
Certiorari." The caption of the document recites: "On Petition for a Writ of Certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the
Sixth Circuit." The conclusion of the document asks me to
stay the "outstanding prior restraint" against petitioner
effected by an order entered by the United States District
Court for the Southern District of Ohio, Western Division,
on September 13. That order restrains petitioner from publishing an article containing "any disclosure of documents
filed under seal, or the contents thereof, without the prior
consent" of the District Court. Petitioner requests that a

1310 McGRAW-HILL COS. v. PROCTER & GAMBLE CO.

Opinion in Chambers
stay of the District Court order "be granted pending its filing of and this Court's ultimate determination of a petition
for a writ of certiorari."

It appears that the District Court order of September 13
was entered without notice to petitioner and that it was not
supported by the findings of fact required by Rule 65(b) of
the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. I assume, therefore,
that if petitioner had filed a prompt motion to dissolve the
order, the District Court would have granted that relief, or
if it had refused to do so, the Court of Appeals would have
had jurisdiction to address the merits of the restraint. Petitioner, however, filed an expedited appeal in the Sixth Circuit, and, on September 19, that court dismissed the appeal
on the ground that it did not have jurisdiction to review the
merits of the restraining order.

The stay application that petitioner has filed with me indicates that it will seek review by writ of certiorari of the
Court of Appeals' jurisdictional holding, but the arguments
advanced in the application address the merits of the District
Court's order. The application does not explain why there
is a substantial basis for concluding that the Court of Appeals erred, or that four Justices of this Court would grant
certiorari to review the jurisdictional issue. Moreover, a
stay is not necessary to preserve this Court's jurisdiction to
review the Court of Appeals' decision; indeed, if the requested stay were granted, any possible review of that decision would probably become moot.

In its discussion of the merits of the District Court's order,
petitioner explains that the documents whose contents it
wants to publish were attachments to a motion filed by
Procter & Gamble in the District Court on September 1,
1995. Referring to that motion, petitioner states:

"The motion was not filed under seal with the district
court and there is no indication anywhere on the motion
itself that any of the described attachments were being

1311Cite as: 515 U. S. 1309 (1995)
Opinion in Chambers
filed under seal." Application to Stay RestrainingOrder Pending Certiorari 4.

That statement appears to have been intended to give methe impression that petitioner's agents obtained knowledge
of the contents of the attachments either (1) without anynotice that they were filed under seal, or (2) under the legitimate belief that their filing in court without any effort topreserve their confidentiality had the effect of placing their
contents in the public domain. The memoranda filed in op-position to the stay application indicate that I may have been
misled by the foregoing statement and that disputed issuesof fact should be resolved before expressing an opinion on
the important constitutional issue that petitioner argues inits stay application. The statement that I have quoted
above seems to acknowledge that the manner in which peti-tioner came into possession of the information it seeks to
publish may have a bearing on its right to do so.Even if I have jurisdiction to pass on the merits of the
District Court's order of September 13--a matter which isdoubtful at best--I am satisfied that the wiser course is to
give the District Court an opportunity to find the relevantfacts, and to allow both that court and the Court of Appeals
to consider the merits of the First Amendment issue beforeit is addressed in this Court. The stay application is, accordingly, denied.
