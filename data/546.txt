ginning  of the continuous  workday.  Such  waiting--which is two steps 
removed  from  the  productive  activity  on  the  assembly  line--comfort-
ably qualifies as a "preliminary" activity.  The fact that certain preshift 
activities are necessary for employees to engage in their principal activi-
ties does not mean that those preshift activities are "integral and indis-
pensable" to a "principal activity" under Steiner.

With respect to "future claims," the Act preserved potential liability for working time not made compensable by contract 

or  custom  but  narrowed  the  coverage  of  the  FLSA  by  ex-cepting two activities that  had been  treated as compensable 
under  our  cases:  walking  on  the  employer's  premises to  and from the actual place of performance of the principal activity 
of the employee, and activities that are "preliminary or post-
liminary" to that principal activity. Specifically,  Part  III  of  the  Portal-to-Portal  Act,  entitled

Opinion of the Court 
larly,  consistent  with  our  prior  decisions  interpreting  the FLSA, the Department of Labor has adopted the continuous 

workday  rule,  which  means  that  the  "workday"  is  generally defined as "the period between the commencement and com-
pletion on the same workday of an employee's principal activ-ity  or  activities."  $ 790.6(b).  These  regulations  have  re-
mained in effect since 1947, see 12 Fed. Reg. 7658 (1947), and 
no  party  disputes  the  validity  of  the  continuous  workday rule. 

In  1955,  eight  years  after  the  enactment  of  the  Portal-to-Portal Act and the promulgation of these interpretive regu-
lations, we were confronted with the question whether work-ers in a battery  plant had a statutory right to compensation 
for  the  "time  incident  to  changing  clothes  at  the  beginning of the shift and showering at the end, where they must make 
extensive use of dangerously caustic and toxic materials, and are  compelled  by  circumstances,  including  vital  considera-
tions of health and hygiene, to change clothes and to shower 
in  facilities  which  state  law  requires  their  employers  to 
provide . . . ."  Steiner

Opinion of the Court 
IBP has also paid for four minutes of clothes-changing time.4 In  1999,  respondents,  IBP  employees,  filed  this  class  action 

to  recover  compensation  for  preproduction  and  postproduc-tion work, including the time spent donning and doffing pro-
tective  gear  and  walking  between  the  locker  rooms  and  the production floor before and after their assigned shifts. 

After  a  lengthy  bench  trial,  the  District  Court  for  the Eastern  District  of  Washington  held  that  donning  and 
doffing  of  protective  gear  that  was  unique  to  the  jobs  at issue were compensable under the FLSA because they were 
integral and indispensable to the work of the employees who wore  such  equipment.  Moreover,  consistent  with  the  con-
tinuous workday rule, the District Court concluded that, for those  employees  required  to  don  and  doff  unique  protective 
gear,  the  walking  time  between  the  locker  room  and  the production  floor  was  also  compensable  because  it  occurs 
during the workday.5  The court did not, however, allow any recovery  for  ordinary  clothes  changing  and  washing,  or  for 
the  "donning  and  doffing  of  hard  hat[s],  ear  plugs,  safety glasses,  boots  [or]  hairnet[s]."  App.  to  Pet.  for  Cert.  in 
No. 03-1238, p. 65a. The  District  Court  proceeded  to  apply  these  legal  conclu-
sions  in  making  detailed  factual  findings  with  regard  to  the different  groups  of  employees.  For  example,  the  District 

4 IBP  does  not  contend  that  this  clothes-changing  time  fully  compen-
sated respondents for the preproduction and postproduction time at issue 
in this case. 

5 The District Court explained: 

"Walking  time  is  compensable  if  it  occurs  after  the  start  of  the  workday. 
29 U. S. C. $ 254(a).  Walking time is excluded under the Portal to Portal 
Act  only if  it  occurs  `either  prior  to  the time  on  any  particular  work  day 
at which such employee commences or subsequent to the time on any par-
ticular  work  day  at  which  he  ceases  such  principal  activity  or  activities.'

tion  of  that  holding  reflects  a  purpose  to  exclude  what  IBP regards as the quite similar walking time spent by respond-

This  footnote  does  indicate  that  the  Secretary  assumed that there would be some cases in which walking between a 
locker room where the employee performs her first principal activity  and  the  production  line  would  be  covered  by  the

ment,  the  questions  submitted  to  the  jury  after  trial  asked jurors to consider only whether Barber was required to com-

Before the case was submitted to the jury, the parties stip-ulated  that  four  categories  of  workers--rotating,  setup, 
meatroom,  and  shipping  and  receiving  associates--were  re-
quired to don protective gear at the beginning of their shifts and were required to doff this gear at the end of their shifts. 

The  jury  then  made  factual  findings  with  regard  to  the amount of time reasonably required for each category of em-
ployees  to  don  and  doff  such  items;  the  jury  concluded  that such  time  was

marginal dollars should be allocated to litigation and administrative ex-
penditures  or  to  educational  services.  There  is  reason  to  believe  that 
a great deal is already spent on IDEA administration, and Congress has 
repeatedly amended the Act to reduce its administrative and litigation-
related costs.  The Act also does not support petitioners' conclusion, in 
effect, that every  IEP should be assumed to be  invalid until the school 
district  demonstrates  that  it  is  not.  Petitioners'  most  plausible  argu-
ment--that  ordinary fairness  requires that a  litigant  not have the bur-
den  of  establishing  facts  peculiarly  within  the  knowledge  of  his  adver-
sary,  United  States  v.  New York,  N.  H. & H. R. Co.,  355  U. S.  253,  256, 
n.  5--fails  because  IDEA  gives  parents  a  number  of  procedural  pro-
tections  that  ensure  that  they  are  not  left  without  a  realistic  chance 
to  access  evidence  or  without  an  expert  to  match  the  government.

Opinion of the Court 
substantially in the Education for All Handicapped Children 
Act  of  1975,  89  Stat.  773.  At  the  time  the  majority  of  dis-
abled children in America were "either totally excluded from 
schools  or  sitting  idly  in  regular  classrooms  awaiting  the 
time  when  they  were  old  enough  to  `drop  out,' "  H.  R.  Rep. 
No. 94-332, p. 2 (1975).  IDEA was intended to reverse this 
history  of  neglect.  As  of  2003,  the  Act  governed  the  pro-
vision  of  special  education  services  to  nearly  7  million  chil-
dren  across  the  country.  See  Dept.  of  Education,  Office  of 
Special  Education  Programs,  Data  Analysis  System,  http:// 
www.ideadata.org/tables27th/ar_  aa9.htm  (as  visited  Nov.  9, 
2005, and available in Clerk of Court's case file). 

IDEA  is  "frequently  described  as  a  model  of  `cooperative 
federalism.' "  Little Rock School Dist. v.  Mauney, 183 F. 3d 
816,  830  (CA8  1999).  It  "leaves  to  the  States  the  primary 
responsibility  for  developing  and  executing  educational  pro-
grams for handicapped children, [but] imposes significant re-
quirements  to  be  followed  in  the  discharge  of  that  responsi-
bility."  Board  of  Ed.  of  Hendrick  Hudson  Central  School 
Dist.,  Westchester  Cty.  v.  Rowley,  458  U. S.  176,  183  (1982). 
For  example,  the  Act  mandates  cooperation  and  reporting 
between  state  and  federal  educational  authorities.  Partici-
pating States must certify to the Secretary of Education that 
they  have  "policies  and  procedures"  that  will  effectively 
meet  the  Act's  conditions.  20  U. S. C.  $ 1412(a).  (Unless 
otherwise  noted,  all  citations  to  the  Act  are  to  the  pre-2004 
version of the statute because this is the version that was in 
effect  during  the  proceedings  below.  We  note,  however, 
that nothing in  the recent 2004 amendments,  118 Stat. 2674, 
appears  to  materially  affect  the  rule  announced  here.) 
State  educational  agencies,  in  turn,  must  ensure  that  local 
schools  and  teachers  are  meeting  the  State's  educational 
standards.  $$ 1412(a)(11), 1412(a)(15)(A).  Local  educa-
tional agencies (school boards or other administrative bodies)

tional  agency  that  they  are  acting  in  accordance  with  the 
State's policies and procedures.  $ 1413(a)(1). 

The  core  of  the  statute,  however,  is  the  cooperative  proc-
ess  that  it  establishes  between  parents  and  schools.  Row-
ley,  supra,  at  205-206  ("Congress  placed  every  bit  as  much 
emphasis  upon  compliance  with  procedures  giving  parents 
and guardians a large measure of participation at every stage 
of the administrative process, . . . as it did upon the measure-
ment  of  the  resulting  IEP  against  a  substantive  standard"). 
The  central  vehicle  for  this  collaboration  is  the  IEP  proc-
ess.  State  educational  authorities  must  identify  and  evalu-
ate disabled children, $$ 1414(a)-(c), develop an IEP for each 
one,  $ 1414(d)(2),  and  review  every  IEP  at  least  once  a 
year,  $ 1414(d)(4).  Each  IEP  must  include  an  assessment 
of  the  child's  current  educational  performance,  must  artic-
ulate measurable educational goals, and must specify the na-
ture  of  the  special  services  that  the  school  will  provide. 

$ 1414(d)(1)(A). 

Parents  and  guardians  play  a  significant  role  in  the  IEP 
process.  They must be informed about and consent to eval-
uations  of  their  child  under  the  Act.  $ 1414(c)(3).  Parents 
are  included  as  members  of  "IEP  teams."  $ 1414(d)(1)(B). 
They have the right to examine any records relating to their 
child,  and  to  obtain  an  "independent  educational  evaluation 
of  the[ir]  child."  $ 1415(b)(1).  They  must be  given  written 
prior  notice  of  any  changes  in  an  IEP,  $ 1415(b)(3),  and  be 
notified  in  writing  of  the  procedural  safeguards  available  to 
them under the Act, $ 1415(d)(1).  If parents believe that an 
IEP is not appropriate, they may seek an administrative "im-
partial  due  process  hearing."  $ 1415(f).  School  districts 
may  also  seek  such  hearings,  as  Congress  clarified  in  the 
2004  amendments.  See  S.  Rep.  No.  108-185,  p.  37  (2003). 
They may do so, for example, if they wish to change an exist-
ing  IEP but the  parents do not  consent, or if  parents refuse 
to  allow  their  child  to  be  evaluated.  As  a  practical  matter,

it  appears  that  most  hearing  requests  come  from  parents rather than schools.  Brief for Petitioners 7. 

Although  state  authorities  have  limited  discretion  to  de-termine who conducts the hearings, $ 1415(f)(1), and respon-
sibility  generally  for  establishing  fair  hearing  procedures, $ 1415(a),  Congress  has  chosen  to  legislate  the  central  com-
ponents  of  due  process  hearings.  It  has  imposed  minimal pleading  standards,  requiring  parties  to  file  complaints  set-
ting  forth  "a  description  of  the  nature  of  the  problem," $ 1415(b)(7)(B)(ii), and "a proposed resolution of the problem 
to  the  extent  known  and  available . . .  at  the  time,"  $ 1415(b)(7)(B)(iii).  At  the  hearing,  all  parties  may  be  ac-
companied  by  counsel,  and  may  "present  evidence  and  con-front,  cross-examine,  and  compel  the  attendance  of  wit-
nesses. "  $$ 1415(h)(1)-(2).  Af ter  the  hearing,  any aggrieved  party  may  bring  a  civil  action  in  state  or  federal 
court.  $ 1415(i)(2).  Prevailing parents may also recover at-torney's  fees.  $ 1415(i)(3)(B).  Congress  has  never  explic-
itly  stated,  however,  which  party  should  bear  the  burden  of proof at IDEA hearings.

This case concerns the educational services that were due, under  IDEA,  to  petitioner  Brian  Schaffer.  Brian  suffers 

from  learning disabilities  and speech-language  impairments. From prekindergarten through seventh grade he attended a 
private  school  and  struggled  academically.  In  1997,  school 
officials informed Brian's mother that he needed a school that could  better  accommodate  his  needs.  Brian's  parents  con-

tacted  respondent  Montgomery  County  Public  Schools  Sys-tem  (MCPS)  seeking  a  placement  for  him  for  the  following 
school year. MCPS  evaluated  Brian  and  convened  an  IEP  team.  The 
committee generated an initial IEP offering Brian a place in either  of  two  MCPS  middle  schools.  Brian's  parents  were 
not  satisfied  with  the  arrangement,  believing  that  Brian

Opinion of the Court 
needed  smaller  classes  and  more  intensive  services.  The 
Schaffers  thus  enrolled  Brian  in  another  private  school,  and 
initiated  a  due  process  hearing  challenging  the  IEP  and 
seeking compensation for the cost of Brian's subsequent pri-
vate education. 

In  Maryland,  IEP  hearings  are  conducted  by  administra-
tive law judges (ALJs).  See Md. Educ. Code Ann. $ 8-413(c) 
(Lexis  2004).  After  a  3-day  hearing,  the  ALJ  deemed  the 
evidence close, held that the parents bore the burden of per-
suasion,  and  ruled  in  favor  of  the  school  district.  The  par-
ents  brought  a  civil  action  challenging  the  result.  The 
United  States  District  Court  for  the  District  of  Maryland 
reversed  and remanded,  after  concluding that  the  burden  of 
persuasion  is  on  the  school  district.  Brian  S.  v.  Vance,  86 
F.  Supp.  2d  538  (2000).  Around  the  same  time,  MCPS  of-
fered Brian a placement in a high school with a special learn-
ing  center.  Brian's  parents  accepted,  and  Brian  was  edu-
cated  in  that  program  until  he  graduated  from  high  school. 
The  suit  remained  alive,  however,  because  the  parents 
sought  compensation  for  the  private  school  tuition  and  re-
lated expenses. 

Respondents  appealed  to  the  United  States  Court  of  Ap-
peals for the Fourth Circuit.  While the appeal was pending, 
the ALJ reconsidered the case, deemed the evidence truly in 
"equipoise,"  and  ruled  in  favor  of  the  parents.  The  Fourth 
Circuit  vacated  and  remanded  the  appeal  so  that  it  could 
consider  the  burden  of  proof  issue  along  with  the  merits  on 
a later appeal.  The District Court reaffirmed its ruling that 
the  school district  has the  burden  of proof.  240  F. Supp. 2d 
396  (Md.  2002).  On  appeal,  a  divided  panel  of  the  Fourth 
Circuit  reversed.  Judge  Michael,  writing  for  the  majority, 
concluded  that  petitioners  offered  no  persuasive  reason  to 
"depart from the normal rule of allocating the burden to the 
party  seeking  relief."  377  F.  3d  449,  453  (2004).  We 
granted  certiorari,  543  U. S.  1145  (2005),  to  resolve  the  fol-

Opinion of the Court 
lowing  question: At  an administrative  hearing assessing  the 
appropriateness  of  an  IEP,  which  party  bears  the  burden 
of persuasion? 

II 

A 

The term "burden of proof " is one of the "slipperiest mem-
ber[s] of the family of legal terms."  2 J. Strong, McCormick 
on  Evidence  $ 342,  p.  433  (5th  ed.  1999)  (hereinafter  McCor-
mick).  Part  of  the  confusion  surrounding  the  term  arises 
from the fact that historically, the concept encompassed two 
distinct  burdens:  the  "burden  of  persuasion,"  i. e.,  which 
party loses if the evidence is closely balanced, and the "bur-
den  of production,"  i. e., which  party bears  the  obligation  to 
come  forward  with  the  evidence  at  different  points  in  the 
proceeding.  Director,  Office  of  Workers'  Compensation 
Programs v.  Greenwich Collieries, 512  U. S. 267, 272 (1994). 
We note at the outset that this case concerns only the burden 
of persuasion, as the parties agree, Brief for Respondents 14; 
Reply Brief for Petitioners 15, and when we speak of burden 
of proof in this opinion, it is this to which we refer. 

When  we  are  determining  the  burden  of  proof  under  a 
statutory cause of action, the touchstone of our inquiry is, of 
course, the statute.  The plain text of IDEA is silent on the 
allocation  of  the  burden  of  persuasion.  We  therefore  begin 
with the ordinary default rule that plaintiffs bear the risk of 
failing to prove their claims.  McCormick $ 337, at 412 ("The 
burdens of pleading and proof with regard to most facts have 
been  and  should  be  assigned  to  the  plaintiff  who  generally 
seeks  to  change  the  present  state  of  affairs  and  who  there-
fore  naturally  should  be  expected  to  bear  the  risk  of  failure 
of  proof  or  persuasion");  C.  Mueller  &  L.  Kirkpatrick,  Evi-
dence  $ 3.1,  p.  104  (3d  ed.  2003)  ("Perhaps  the  broadest  and 
most accepted idea is that the person who seeks court action 
should  justify  the  request,  which  means  that  the  plaintiffs 
bear the burdens on the elements in their claims").

Opinion of the Court 
Thus,  we  have  usually  assumed  without  comment  that plaintiffs bear the burden of persuasion regarding the essen-

tial  aspects  of  their  claims.  For  example,  Title  VII  of  the Civil  Rights  Act  of  1964,  42  U. S. C.  $ 2000e 

et  seq.,  does  not 
directly  state  that  plaintiffs  bear  the  "ultimate"  burden  of persuasion,  but  we  have  so  concluded.

Center v.  Hicks, 509 U. S. 502, 511 (1993); id., at 531 (Souter,

58  SCHAFFER  v.  WEAST 

Opinion of the Court 
we will conclude that the  burden  of persuasion lies where  it usually falls, upon the party seeking relief. 

B 
Petitioners  contend  first  that  a  close  reading  of  IDEA's text compels a conclusion in their favor.  They urge that we 

should  interpret  the  statutory  words  "due  process"  in  light of their constitutional meaning, and apply the balancing test 
established  by  Mathews  v.  Eldridge,  424  U. S.  319  (1976). Even  assuming  that  the  Act  incorporates  constitutional  due 
process  doctrine,  Eldridge  is  no  help  to  petitioners  because "[o]utside  the  criminal  law  area,  where  special  concerns  at-
tend,  the  locus  of  the  burden  of  persuasion  is  normally not  an  issue  of  federal  constitutional  moment." 

Lavine  v. Milne, 424 U. S. 577, 585 (1976). 

Petitioners  next  contend  that  we  should  take  instruction from  the  lower  court  opinions  of  Mills  v.  Board  of  Educa-
tion, 348 F. Supp. 866 (DC 1972), and Pennsylvania Associa-tion  for  Retarded  Children  v.  Pennsylvania,  334  F.  Supp. 
1257  (ED  Pa.  1971)  (hereinafter  PARC).  IDEA's  drafters were  admittedly  guided  "to  a  significant  extent"  by  these 
two  landmark  cases.  Rowley,  458  U. S.,  at  194.  As  the court  below  noted,  however,  the  fact  that  Congress  "took  a 
number  of the  procedural  safeguards  from  PARC and  Mills and  wrote  them  directly  into  the  Act"  does  not  allow  us  to 
"conclude . . . that Congress intended to adopt the ideas that it  failed  to  write  into  the  text  of  the  statute."  377  F.  3d, 
at 455. Petitioners also urge that putting the burden of persuasion 
on  school  districts  will  further  IDEA's  purposes  because  it will help ensure that children receive a free appropriate pub-
lic  education.  In  truth,  however,  very  few  cases  will  be  in evidentiary  equipoise.  Assigning  the  burden  of  persuasion 
to  school  districts  might  encourage  schools  to  put  more  re-sources  into  preparing  IEPs  and  presenting  their  evidence. 
But  IDEA  is  silent  about  whether  marginal  dollars  should

Opinion of the Court 
be allocated to litigation and administrative expenditures or 
to  educational  services.  Moreover,  there  is  reason  to  be-
lieve that a great deal is already spent on the administration 
of the Act.  Litigating a due process complaint is an expen-
sive  affair,  costing  schools  approximately  $8,000  to  $12,000 
per  hearing.  See  Department  of  Education,  J.  Chambers, 
J. Harr, & A. Dhanani, What Are We Spending on Procedural 
Safeguards  in  Special  Education  1999-2000,  p.  8  (May  2003) 
(prepared  under  contract  by  American  Institutes  for  Re-
search,  Special  Education  Expenditure  Project).  Congress 
has  also  repeatedly  amended  the  Act  in  order  to  reduce  its 
administrative and litigation-related  costs.  For example, in 
1997  Congress  mandated  that  States  offer  mediation  for 
IDEA  disputes.  $ 615(e)  of  IDEA,  as  added  by  $ 101  of  the 
Individuals  with  Disabilities  Education  Act  Amendments  of 
1997,  Pub.  L.  105-17,  111  Stat.  90,  20  U. S. C.  $ 1415(e).  In 
2004,  Congress  added  a  mandatory  "resolution  session" 
prior to any due process hearing.  $ 615(f)(1)(B) of IDEA, as 
added by $ 101 of the Individuals with Disabilities Education 
Improvement  Act  of  2004,  Pub.  L.  108-446,  118  Stat.  2720, 
20 U. S. C. A. $ 1415(f)(1)(B) (Supp. 2005).  It also made new 
findings  that  "[p]arents  and  schools  should  be  given  ex-
panded opportunities to resolve their disagreements in posi-
tive  and  constructive  ways,"  and  that  "[t]eachers,  schools, 
local  educational  agencies,  and  States  should  be  relieved  of 
irrelevant  and  unnecessary  paperwork  burdens  that  do  not 
lead  to  improved  educational  outcomes."  $$ 1400(c)(8)-(9). 

Petitioners  in  effect  ask  this  Court  to  assume  that  every 
IEP  is  invalid  until  the  school  district  demonstrates  that  it 
is  not.  The  Act  does  not  support  this  conclusion.  IDEA 
relies  heavily  upon  the  expertise  of  school  districts  to  meet 
its  goals.  It  also  includes  a  so-called  "stay-put"  provision, 
which requires a  child to remain  in  his  or her  "then-current 
educational  placement"  during  the  pendency  of  an  IDEA 
hearing.  $ 1415( j).  Congress  could  have  required  that  a

60  SCHAFFER  v.  WEAST 

Opinion of the Court 
child  be  given  the  educational  placement  that  a  parent  re-quested during a dispute, but it did no such thing.  Congress 

appears  to  have  presumed  instead  that,  if  the  Act's  proce-dural requirements are respected, parents will prevail when 
they have legitimate grievances.  See Rowley, supra, at 206 (noting  the  "legislative  conviction  that  adequate  compliance 
with  the  procedures  prescribed  would  in  most  cases  assure 
much  if  not  all  of  what  Congress  wished  in  the  way  of  sub-stantive content in an IEP"). 

Petitioners'  most  plausible  argument  is  that  "[t]he  ordi-nary rule, based on considerations of fairness, does not place 
the  burden  upon  a  litigant  of  establishing  facts  peculiarly 
within  the  knowledge  of  his  adversary."  United  States  v. 
New York,  N.  H. & H.  R. Co.,  355  U. S.  253,  256,  n.  5  (1957); 
see also Concrete Pipe & Products of Cal., Inc. v.  Construc-
tion  Laborers  Pension  Trust  for  Southern  Cal.,  508  U. S. 
602,  626  (1993).  But  this  "rule  is  far  from  being  universal, 
and  has  many  qualifications  upon  its  application."  Green-
leaf 's Lessee v.  Birth, 6 Pet. 302, 312 (1832); see also McCor-
mick  $ 337,  at  413  ("Very  often  one  must  plead  and  prove 
matters as to which his adversary has superior access to the 
proof ").  School  districts  have  a  "natural  advantage"  in  in-
formation  and  expertise,  but  Congress  addressed  this  when 
it  obliged  schools  to  safeguard  the  procedural  rights  of 
parents  and  to  share  information  with  them.  See  School 
Comm.  of  Burlington  v.  Department  of  Ed.  of  Mass.,  471 
U. S.  359,  368  (1985).  As  noted  above,  parents  have  the 
right  to review all records  that  the  school  possesses in  rela-
tion  to  their  child.  $ 1415(b)(1).  They  also  have  the  right 
to  an  "independent  educational  evaluation  of  the[ir]  child." 
Ibid.  The  regulations  clarify  this  entitlement  by  providing 
that  a  "parent  has  the  right  to  an  independent  educational 
evaluation  at  public  expense  if  the  parent  disagrees  with 
an  evaluation  obtained  by  the  public  agency."  34  CFR 

$ 300.502(b)(1) (2005).  IDEA thus ensures parents access to 
an expert who can evaluate all the materials that the school

Opinion of the Court 
must make available, and who can give an independent opin-ion.  They are not left to challenge the government without 

a  realistic  opportunity  to  access  the  necessary  evidence, or  without  an  expert  with  the  firepower  to  match  the 
opposition. Additionally, in 2004, Congress added provisions requiring 
school  districts  to  answer  the  subject  matter  of  a  complaint in writing, and to provide parents with the reasoning behind 
the  disputed  action,  details  about  the  other  options  consid-ered  and  rejected  by  the  IEP  team,  and  a  description  of  all 
evaluations,  reports,  and  other  factors  that  the  school  used in  coming  to  its  decision.  $ 615(c)(2)(B)(i)(I)  of  IDEA,  as 
added by $ 101 of Pub. L. 108-446, 118 Stat. 2718, 20 U. S. C. $ 1415(c)(2)(B)(i)(I)  (2000  ed.,  Supp.  V).  Prior  to  a  hearing, 
the  parties  must  disclose  evaluations  and  recommendations that  they  intend  to  rely  upon.  20  U. S. C.  $ 1415(f)(2). 
IDEA  hearings  are  deliberately  informal  and  intended  to give  ALJs the  flexibility  that  they  need  to  ensure that  each 
side can fairly present its evidence.  IDEA, in fact, requires state  authorities to organize hearings in  a way  that guaran-
tees  parents  and  children  the  procedural  protections  of the  Act.  See  $ 1415(a).  Finally,  and  perhaps  most  impor-
tantly,  parents  may  recover  attorney's  fees  if  they  prevail. $ 1415(i)(3)(B).  These  protections  ensure  that  the  school 
bears no unique informational advantage. 

III 
Finally,  respondents  and  several  States  urge  us  to  decide that  States  may,  if  they  wish,  override  the  default  rule  and 

put the burden always on the school district.  Several States have  laws or  regulations  purporting  to  do  so,  at least  under 
some circumstances.  See, e. g., Minn. Stat. $ 125A.091, subd. 16 (2004); Ala. Admin. Code Rule 290-8-9-.08(8)(c)(6) (Supp. 
2004);  Alaska  Admin.  Code,  tit.  4,  $ 52.550(e)(9)  (2003);  Del. Code  Ann.,  Tit.  14,  $ 3140  (1999).  Because  no  such  law  or 
regulation exists  in Maryland, we  need not decide this issue

ter  Cynthia  died  in  the  fire.  At  trial,  the  State  presented evidence  of  respondent's  intent  to  kill  his  ex-girlfriend  and 

her  boyfriend,  but  not  of  specific  intent  to  kill  Cynthia  Col-lins.  The  State  also  offered  expert  forensic  evidence  to 
show  that  the  fire  had  been  started  deliberately.  Respond-ent did not contest this forensic evidence at trial because his 
retained arson expert had reported that the State's evidence conclusively  established  arson.  Respondent  was  convicted 
of  aggravated  felony  murder  on  a  theory  of  transferred  in-tent  and  sentenced  to  death.  His  conviction  and  sentence

Respondent  sought  postconviction  relief  in  state  court. The  state  trial  court  denied  his  request  for  an  evidentiary 
hearing  and  denied  relief  on  all  claims,  and  the  state  appel-late court affirmed.  Respondent then sought federal habeas 
relief.  The  District  Court  permitted  discovery  on  certain issues, but ultimately denied all of respondent's claims.  The 
Sixth Circuit reversed, holding that respondent was entitled to  habeas  relief  on  two  alternative  grounds.  First,  that 
transferred  intent  was  not  a  permissible  theory  for  aggra-vated  felony  murder  under  Ohio  law,  and  that  the  evidence 
of  direct  intent  was  constitutionally  insufficient  to  support conviction.  Second,  that  the  performance  of  respondent's 
trial counsel had been constitutionally deficient under Strick-land

incidence," Oklahoma Tax Comm'n v.  Chickasaw Nation, 515 U. S. 450, 
458  (emphasis  added).  Moreover,  the  States  are  categorically  barred 
from placing a tax's legal incidence "on a tribe or on tribal members for 
sales made inside Indian country" without congressional authorization. 
Id., at 459 (emphasis added).  Even when a State imposes a tax's legal 
incidence on a non-Indian seller, the tax may nonetheless be pre-empted 
if  the  transaction  giving  rise  to  tax  liability  occurs  on  the  reservation 
and  the  imposition  of  the  tax  fails  to  satisfy  the  Bracker  interest-
balancing  test.  See,  e. g.,  Central  Machinery  Co.  v.  Arizona  Tax 
Comm'n, 448 U. S. 160.  Pp. 101-102. 

(b)  The  Court  rejects  the  Nation's  argument  that  it  is  entitled  to 
prevail  under  Chickasaw's  categorical  bar  because  the  fairest  reading 
of  the  Kansas  statute  is  that  the  tax's  legal  incidence  actually  falls  on 
the Tribe on the reservation.  Under the statute, the tax's incidence is 
expressly imposed on the distributor that first receives the fuel.  Such 
"dispositive  language"  from  the  state  legislature  is  determinative  of 
who  bears  a  state  excise  tax's  legal  incidence.  Chickasaw,  supra,  at 
461.  Even  absent  such  "dispositive  language,"  the  Court  would  none-
theless  conclude  that  the  tax's  legal  incidence  is  on  the  distributor  be-
cause Kansas law makes clear that it is the distributor, not the retailer, 
that  is  liable  for  the  tax.  The  lower  courts  and  the  Kansas  agency 
charged with administering the motor fuel tax reached the same conclu-
sion.  Kaul v.  State Dept. of Revenue, 266 Kan. 464, 970 P. 2d 60, distin-
guished.  Pp. 102-105. 

(c)  Also  rejected  is  the  Nation's  alternative  argument  that  the 
Bracker test must be applied irrespective of who bears the Kansas tax's 
legal incidence because the tax arises as a result  of the on-reservation 
sale and delivery of fuel.  The Nation presented a starkly different, and 
correct, interpretation of the statute in the Tenth Circuit, arguing that 
the  balancing  test  is  appropriate  even  though  the  tax's  legal  incidence 
is  imposed  on  the  Nation's  non-Indian  distributor  and  is  triggered  by 
the  distributor's  receipt  of  fuel  outside  the  reservation.  The  Nation's 
argument  here  is  rebutted by  provisions  of the  Kansas statute  demon-
strating  that  the  only  taxable  event  occurs  when  the  distributor  first 
receives the fuel and by a final determination by the State reaching the 
same  conclusion.  The  Nation's  theory  that  the  existence  of  statutory 
deductions  for  certain  postreceipt  transactions  make  it  impossible  for 
a  distributor  to  calculate  its  ultimate  tax  liability  without  knowing 
whether,  where,  and  to  whom  the  fuel  is  ultimately  sold  or  delivered 
suffers  from  several  conceptual  defects.  For  example,  availability  of 
the  deductions  does  not  change  the  nature  of  the  taxable  event,  the 
distributor's receipt of the fuel.  Pp. 105-110.

2.  The Tenth Circuit erred in concluding that the Kansas tax is never-
theless subject to Bracker's test.  That test applies only where "a State 
asserts  authority  over  the  conduct  of  non-Indians  engaging  in  activity 
on  the  reservation."  448  U. S.,  at  144.  It  has  never  been  applied 
where, as here, a state tax imposed on a non-Indian arises from a trans-
action occurring off the reservation.  The Court's Indian tax immunity 
cases counsel against such an application.  Pp. 110-115. 

(a)  Limiting the Bracker test exclusively to on-reservation transac-
tions between a nontribal entity and a tribe or tribal member is consist-
ent with this Court's unique Indian tax immunity jurisprudence, which 
relies  "heavily  on  the  doctrine  of  tribal  sovereignty  [giving]  state  law 
`no role to play' within a tribe's territorial boundaries," Oklahoma Tax 
Comm'n v.  Sac and Fox Nation, 508 U. S. 114, 123-124.  The Court has 
taken an altogether different course, by contrast, when a State asserts 
its taxing authority outside of Indian country.  E. g., Chickasaw, supra. 
In  such  cases,  "[a]bsent  express  federal  law  to  the  contrary,  Indians 
going  beyond  reservation  boundaries  have  generally  been  held  subject 
to nondiscriminatory state law otherwise applicable to all citizens of the 
State."  Mescalero Apache Tribe v.  Jones, 411 U. S. 145, 148-149.  If a 
State may apply a nondiscriminatory tax to Indians who have gone be-
yond the reservation's boundaries, it may also apply a nondiscriminatory 
tax where, as here, the tax is imposed on non-Indians as a result of an 
off-reservation transaction.  In these circumstances, Bracker is inappli-
cable.  Cf. Arizona Dept. of Revenue v.  Blaze Constr. Co., 526 U. S. 32, 
37.  The application of the test here is also inconsistent with the Court's 
efforts  to  establish  "bright  line  standard[s]"  in  the  tax  administration 
context.  Ibid.  The Nation is not entitled to interest balancing by vir-
tue  of  its  claim  that  the  Kansas  tax  interferes  with  the  Nation's  own 
motor  fuel  tax.  This  is  ultimately  a  complaint  about  the  state  tax's 
downstream economic consequences.  The Nation cannot invalidate that 
tax by  complaining about  a  decrease in  its revenues.  See,  e. g., Wash-
ington  v.  Confederated  Tribes  of  Colville  Reservation,  447  U. S.  134, 
156.  Nor  would  the  Court's  analysis  change  if  legal  significance  were 
accorded the Nation's decision to label a portion of its gas station's reve-
nues as tax proceeds.  See id., at 184, n. 9.  Pp. 110-115. 

(b)  This Court rejects the Nation's contention that the Kansas tax 
is  invalid  notwithstanding  the  Bracker  test's  inapplicability  because  it 
exempts from taxation fuel sold or delivered to state and federal sover-
eigns and is therefore impermissibly discriminatory.  The Nation is not 
similarly situated to the exempted sovereigns.  While Kansas' tax pays 
for  roads  and  bridges  on  the  Nation's  reservation,  including  the  main 
highway  used  by  casino  patrons,  Kansas  offers  no  such  services  to  the

several  States  or  the  Federal  Government.  Moreover,  to  the  extent 
Kansas  retailers  bear  the  tax's  cost,  that  burden  applies  equally  to  all 
retailers  within  the  State  regardless  of  whether  they  are  located  on  a 
reservation.  P. 115.

the Nation.2 The  Nation  sells  its  fuel  within  2  cents  per  gallon  of  the 
prevailing market price.  Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation v.  Richards, 379 F. 3d 979, 982 (CA10 2004).  It does so not-
withstanding the distributor's decision to pass along the cost of the State's fuel tax to the Nation, and the Nation's decision 
to impose its own tax on the station's fuel sales in the amount of  16  cents  per  gallon  of  gasoline  and  18  cents  per  gallon  of 
diesel  (increased  to  20  cents  for  gasoline  and  22  cents  for diesel in January 2003). 

Ibid.  The Nation's fuel tax gener-ates approximately $300,000 annually,  funds that  the  Nation 

uses  for  " `constructing  and  maintaining  roads,  bridges  and rights-of-way located on or near the Reservation,' " including 
the  access  road  between  the  state-funded  highway  and  the casino.  Ibid. 

The Nation brought an action in Federal District Court for declaratory  judgment  and  injunctive  relief  from  the  State's 
collection of motor fuel tax from distributors who deliver fuel to  the  reservation.  The  District  Court  granted  summary 
judgment  in  favor  of  the  State.  Applying  the  Bracker interest-balancing  test,  it  determined  that  the  balance  of 
state, federal, and tribal interests tilted in favor of the State. The  court  reached  this  determination  because  "it  is  undis-
puted  that  the  legal  incidence  of  the  tax  is  directed  off-reservation  at  the  fuel  distributors,"

2003),  and  because  the  ultimate  purchasers  of  the  fuel,  non-Indian casino patrons, receive the bulk of their governmental 

services  from  the  State,  id.,  at  1309.  The  court  held  that the  State's  tax  did  not  interfere  with  the  Nation's  right  of 
self-government,  adding  that  "a  tribe  cannot  oust  a  state from any power to tax on-reservation purchases by nonmem-
bers of the tribe by simply imposing its own tax on the trans-actions or by otherwise earning its revenues from the tribal 
business."  Id., at 1311. The Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit reversed.  379 
F.  3d  979  (2004).  It  determined  that,  under  Bracker,  the balance  of  state,  federal,  and  tribal  interests  favored  the 
Tribe.  The  Tenth  Circuit  reasoned  that  the  Nation's  fuel revenues  were  "derived  from  value  generated  primarily  on 
its reservation," 379 F. 3d, at 984--namely, the creation of a new fuel market by virtue of the presence of the casino--and 
that the Nation's interests in taxing this reservation-created value  to  raise  revenue  for  reservation  infrastructure  out-
weighed  the  State's  "general  interest  in  raising  revenues," id., at 986.  We granted certiorari, 543 U. S. 1186 (2005), and 
now reverse.  II 

Although  we  granted  certiorari  to  determine  whether Kansas  may  tax  a  non-Indian  distributor's 

off-reservation receipt of fuel without being subject to the 
Bracker interest-balancing  test,  Pet.  for  Cert.  i,  the  Nation  maintains  that

from  placing  the  legal  incidence  of  an  excise  tax  "on  a  tribe or on tribal members for sales made inside Indian country" 

without  congressional  authorization,  id.,  at  459  (emphasis added).  We  have  further  determined  that,  even  when  a 
State  imposes  the  legal  incidence  of  its  tax  on  a  non-Indian seller,  the  tax  may  nonetheless  be  pre-empted  if  the  trans-
action  giving  rise  to  tax  liability  occurs  on  the  reservation and  the  imposition  of  the  tax  fails  to  satisfy  the 

Bracker interest-balancing  test.  See  448  U. S.  136  (holding  that 

state  taxes  imposed  on  on-reservation  logging  and  hauling operations  by  non-Indian  contractor  are  invalid  under  the 
interest-balancing  test);  cf.  Central  Machinery  Co.  v.  Ari-zona  Tax  Comm'n,  448  U. S.  160  (1980)  (holding  that  the 
Indian  trader  statutes  pre-empted  Arizona's  tax  on  a  non-Indian seller's on-reservation sales). 

The  Nation  maintains  that  it  is  entitled  to  prevail  under the  categorical  bar  articulated  in  Chickasaw  because  "[t]he 
fairest  reading  of  the  statute  is  that  the  legal  incidence  of the  tax  actually  falls  on  the  Tribe  [on  the  reservation]." 
Brief  for  Respondent  17,  n.  5.  The  Nation  alternatively maintains  it  is  entitled  to  prevail  even  if  the  legal  incidence 
of the tax is on the non-Indian distributor because, according to  the  Nation,  the  tax  arises  out  of  a  distributor's  on-
reservation  transaction  with the Tribe  and is  therefore sub-ject to the 

Bracker balancing test.  Brief for Respondent 15. We address the "who" and the "where" of Kansas' motor fuel 

tax in turn.  A 

Kansas law specifies that "the incidence of [the motor fuel] tax  is  imposed  on  the  distributor  of  the  first  receipt  of 
the  motor  fuel."  Kan.  Stat.  Ann.  $ 79-3408(c)  (2003  Cum. Supp.).  We have suggested that such "dispositive language" 
from the  state  legislature  is  determinative of who  bears the legal  incidence  of  a  state  excise  tax.  Chickasaw,  supra,  at 
461.  But even if the state legislature had not employed such "dispositive  language,"  thereby  requiring  us  instead  to  look

Opinion of the Court 
to a "fair interpretation of the taxing statute as written and applied," 

California  Bd.  of  Equalization  v.  Chemehuevi 
Tribe, 474 U. S. 9, 11 (1985) (per curiam), we would nonethe-less  conclude  that  the  legal  incidence  of  the  tax  is  on  the 

distributor. Kansas  law  makes  clear  that  it  is  the  distributor,  rather 
than  the  retailer,  that  is  liable  to  pay  the  motor  fuel  tax. 
Section  79-3410(a)  (1997)  provides,  in  relevant  part,  that "[e]very  distributor  .  .  .  shall  compute  and  shall  pay  to  the 

director  .  .  .  the  amount  of  [motor  fuel]  taxes  due  to  the state."  While  the  distributors  are  "entitled"  to  pass  along 
the  cost of the  tax  to  downstream purchasers, see  $ 79-3409 
(2003  Cum.  Supp.),  they  are  not  required  to  do  so.  In  sum, 
the  legal  incidence  of  the  Kansas  motor  fuel  tax  is  on  the 
distributor.  The  lower  courts  reached  the  same  conclusion. 
379 F. 3d, at 982 ("The Kansas legislature structured the tax 
so  that  its  legal  incidence  is  placed  on  non-Indian  distribu-
tors");  241  F.  Supp.  2d,  at  1311  ("[I]t  is  undisputed  that  the

dence  of  the  [Kansas]  tax  law  as  presently  written  falls  on

Tribe of Nebraska v.  Kline, 297 F. Supp. 2d 1291, 1294 (Kan.

LaFaver, 31  F. Supp. 2d 1298, 1307 (Kan. 1998) ("[T]he stat-
utes are extremely clear in providing that the tax in question

104  WAGNON  v.  PRAIRIE  BAND  POTAWATOMI  NATION 

Opinion of the Court 
(hereinafter  Kansas  Dept.  of  Revenue  Letter)  ("The  legal 
incidence  of  the  Kansas  fuel  tax  rests  with  Davies,  the  dis-
tributor, who is up-stream from Nation, the retailer"). 

The  United  States,  as  amicus,  contends  that  this  conclu-
sion is foreclosed by the Kansas Supreme Court's decision in 
Kaul  v.  State  Dept.  of  Revenue,  266  Kan.  464,  970  P.  2d  60 
(1998).  The  United  States  reads  Kaul  as  holding  that  the 
legal incidence of Kansas' motor fuel tax rests on the Indian 
retailers,  rather  than  on  the  non-Indian  distributors.  And, 
under  the  United  States'  view,  so  long  as  the  Kansas  Su-
preme Court's " `definitive determination as to the operating 
incidence' "  of  its  fuel  tax  is  " `consistent  with  the  statute's 
reasonable  interpretation,' "  it  should  be  " `deemed  conclu-
sive.' "  Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 10 (quot-
ing Gurley v.  Rhoden, 421 U. S. 200, 208 (1975)). 

We  disagree  with  the  United  States'  interpretation  of 
Kaul.  In  Kaul,  two  members  of  the  Citizen  Band  Potawa-
tomi Tribe of Oklahoma sought to enjoin the enforcement of 
Kansas' fuel tax on fuel delivered to their gas station located 
on  the  Prairie  Band  Potawatomi  Tribe  of  Kansas'  Reserva-
tion.  The  Kansas  Supreme  Court  determined  that  the  sta-
tion  owners  had  standing  to  challenge  the  tax  because  the 
statute provided that the distributor was entitled to " `charge 
and  collect  such  tax . . . as a part of the  selling  price.' " 
Kaul, supra, at 474, 970 P. 2d, at 67 (quoting Kan. Stat. Ann. 

$ 79-3409  (1995);  emphasis  deleted).  The  court  determined 
that  the  station  owners  were  not  entitled  to  an  injunction, 
however,  because  they  were  not  members  of  a  Kansas  tribe 
and  thus  there  had  "been  no  showing  by  Retailers  that 
payment  of  fuel  tax  to  Kansas  interferes  with  the  self-
government  of  a  Kansas  tribe  or  a  Kansas  tribal  member." 
266 Kan., at 477, 970 P. 2d, at 69.  The court then noted that 
"the  legal  incidence  of  the  tax  on  motor  fuel  rests  on  non-
tribal  members  and  does  not  affect  the  Potawatomi  Indian 
reservation within the state of Kansas."  Ibid.

Opinion of the Court 
Kaul does not foreclose our determination that the distrib-utor  bears  the  legal  incidence  of  the  Kansas  motor  fuel  tax. 

As  an  initial  matter,  it  is  unclear  whether  the  court's  refer-ence to "nontribal members" is a reference to the non-tribal-
member retailers or the non-tribal-member distributors.  At the  very  least,  Kaul's  imprecise  language  cannot  be  charac-
terized  as  a  definitive  determination.  Moreover,  the  1998 amendments  to  the  Kansas  fuel  provisions,  including  the 
amendment to $ 79-3408(c) that provides that "the incidence of  this  tax  is  imposed  on  the  distributor,"  were  not  applied 
in Kaul.  Id.,  at 473, 970 P. 2d, at 66 (identifying provisions that  were  repealed  in  1998  as  being  "in  effect  during  the 
period  relevant  to  this  case");  id.,  at  474,  970  P.  2d,  at  67 (noting  that  a  "critical  statute"  to  its  holding  was  the  1995 
version of $ 79-3409, which was  amended in 1998).  Accord-ingly, 

Kaul  did  not  speak  authoritatively  on  the  provisions before us today. 

B 
The  Nation  maintains  that  we  must  apply  the  Bracker interest-balancing  test,  irrespective  of  the  identity  of  the 

taxpayer  (i. e.,  the  party  bearing  the  legal  incidence),  be-cause  the  Kansas  fuel  tax  arises  as  a  result  of  the 

on-reservation  sale  and  delivery  of  the  motor  fuel.  See  Brief 

for Respondent 15.  Notably, however, the Nation presented a  starkly  different  interpretation  of  the  statute  in  the  pro-
ceedings  before  the  Court  of  Appeals,  arguing  that  "[t]he 
balancing test is appropriate even though the legal incidence of  the  tax  is  imposed  on  the  Nation's  non-Indian  distributor 

and  is  triggered  by  the  distributor's  receipt  of  fuel  outside 
the  reservation."  Appellant's  Reply  Brief  in  No.  03-3218 
(CA10),  p.  3  (emphasis  added);  see  also  241  F.  Supp.  2d,  at 1311 (District Court observing that "it is undisputed that the 

legal  incidence  of  the  tax  is  directed  off-reservation  at  the fuel distributors").  A "fair interpretation of the taxing stat-
ute as written and applied," Chemehuevi Tribe, 474 U. S., at

106  WAGNON  v.  PRAIRIE  BAND  POTAWATOMI  NATION 

Opinion of the Court 
11,  confirms  that  the  Nation's  interpretation  of  the  statute before the Court of Appeals was correct. 

As written, the Kansas fuel tax provisions state that "the incidence of this tax is imposed on the distributor of the first 
receipt  of  the  motor  fuel  and  such  taxes  shall  be  paid  but once.  Such tax shall be computed on all motor-vehicle fuels 
or  special  fuels  received  by  each  distributor,  manufacturer 
or  importer  in  this  state  and  paid  in  the  manner  provided for  herein  . . . ."   Kan.  Stat.  Ann.  $ 79-3408(c)  (2003  Cum. 

Supp.).  Under  this  provision,  the  distributor  who  initially receives  the  motor  fuel  is  liable  for  payment  of  the  fuel  tax, 
and  the  distributor's  tax  liability  is  determined  by  calculat-ing the amount of fuel received by the distributor. 

Section  79-3410(a)  (1997)  confirms  that  it  is  the  distribu-tor's  off-reservation  receipt  of  the  motor  fuel,  and  not  any 
subsequent  event,  that  establishes  tax  liability.  That  sec-tion provides: 

"[E]very  distributor,  manufacturer,  importer,  exporter or  retailer  of  motor-vehicle  fuels  or  special  fuels,  on  or 
before  the  25th  day  of  each  month,  shall  render  to  the director  .  .  .  a  report  certified  to  be  true  and  correct 
showing the number of gallons of motor-vehicle fuels or special fuels received by such distributor, manufacturer, 
importer, exporter or retailer during the preceding cal-
endar  month  .  .  .  .  Every  distributor,  manufacturer  or importer  within the  time herein fixed for the  rendering 

of such reports, shall compute and shall pay to the direc-tor  at  the  director's  office  the  amount  of  taxes  due  to 
the  state  on  all  motor-vehicle  fuels  or  special  fuels  re-
ceived  by  such  distributor,  manufacturer  or  importer 
during the preceding calendar month." 

Thus,  Kansas  law  expressly  provides  that  a  distributor's 
monthly  tax  obligations  are  determined  by  the  amount  of 
fuel received by the distributor during the preceding month. 
See  Kline,  297  F.  Supp.  2d,  at  1294  ("The  distributor  must

Opinion of the Court 
compute  and  remit the  tax  each  month  for the  fuel  received by the distributor in the State of Kansas"). 

The  Nation  disagrees.  It  contends  that  what  is  taxed  is not  the distributors'  (off-reservation)  receipt  of the  fuel, but 
rather  the  distributors'  use,  sale,  or  delivery  of  the  motor fuel--in  this  case,  the  distributors'  (on-reservation)  sale  or 
delivery to the Nation.  The Nation grounds support for this 
proposition in $ 79-3408(a) (2003 Cum. Supp.).  That section provides that "[a] tax . . . is hereby imposed on the use, sale 

or  delivery  of  all  motor  vehicle  fuels  or  special  fuels  which are used, sold or delivered in this state for any purpose what-
soever."  But  this  section  cannot  be  read  in  isolation.  If  it 
were,  it  would  permit  Kansas  to  tax  the  same  fuel  multiple 
times--namely,  every  time  fuel  is  sold,  delivered,  or  used. 
Section 79-3408(a) must be read in conjunction with subsec-
tion (c),  which specifies that  "the incidence of this tax  is im-
posed on the distributor of the first receipt of the motor fuel 
and such taxes shall be paid but once."  (Emphasis added.) 
The  identity  of  the  single,  taxable  event  is  revealed  in  the 
very  next  sentence  of  subsection  (c),  which  provides  that 
"[s]uch  tax  shall  be  computed  on  all  .  .  .  fuels  received  by 
each  distributor."  (Emphasis  added.)  In  short,  the  "use, 
sale  or delivery"  that triggers  tax  liability  is  the  sale  or de-
livery  of  the  fuel  to  the  distributor.  The  Kansas  Depart-
ment  of  Revenue  has  issued  a  final  determination  reaching 
the  same  conclusion.  See  Kansas  Dept.  of  Revenue  Letter 
("[P]ursuant to the Kansas Motor Fuel Tax Act . . . the state 
fuel  tax  was  imposed  on  Davies,  a  distributor,  when  Davies 
first  received  the  fuel  at  its  business,  a  site  located  off  of 
Nation's reservation" (emphasis added)). 

The  Nation  claims  further  support  for  its  interpretation 
of  the  statute  in  $ 79-3408(d)  (2003  Cum.  Supp.).  Section 
79-3408(d)  permits  distributors  to  obtain  deductions  from 
the  Kansas  motor  fuel  tax  for  certain  postreceipt  transac-
tions,  such  as  sale  or  delivery  of  fuel  for  export  from  the 
State  and  sale  or  delivery  of  fuel  to  the  United  States.

108  WAGNON  v.  PRAIRIE  BAND  POTAWATOMI  NATION 

Opinion of the Court 

$$ 79-3408(d)(1)-(2).  The  Nation  argues  that  these  exemp-
tions make it impossible for a distributor to calculate its "ul-
timate  tax  liability"  without  knowing  "whether,  where,  and 
to whom the  fuel is ultimately sold or delivered."  Brief for 
Respondent  15.  The  Nation  infers  from  these  provisions 
that  the  taxable  event  is  actually  the  distributors'  postre-
ceipt  delivery  of  fuel  to  retailers  such  as  the  Nation,  rather 
than the distributors' initial receipt of the fuel. 

The  Nation's  theory  suffers  from  a  number  of  conceptual 
defects.  First, under Kansas law, a distributor must pay the 
tax  even  for  fuel  that  sits  in  its  inventory--fuel  that  is  not 
(or  at least  has  not  yet  been)  used, sold,  or delivered  by the 
distributor.3  But the Nation's interpretation presumes that 
the  tax is owed only on a  distributor's postreceipt  use, sale, 
or  delivery  of  fuel.  As  this  interpretation  cannot  be  recon-
ciled with the manner in which the Kansas motor fuel tax is 

3 This  understanding  of  the  application  of  the  Kansas  fuel  tax  is  con-
firmed by the form that fuel distributors are required to fill out each month 
pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. $ 79-3410 (1997).  See Kansas Form MF-52, 
available  at  http://www.ksrevenue.org/pdf/forms/mf52.pdf  (as  visited  Nov. 
21,  2005,  and  available  in Clerk  of Court's  case  file).  The form  instructs 
distributors  to  enter  in  line  1  "the  total  net  gallons  of  gasoline,  gasohol 
and special  fuel received or  imported" during  the  preceding month.  Id., 
at 2.  The distributors may then "[e]nter the deductions that apply to your 
business"  in  lines  2(a)-to-(e)  for  the  preceding  month.  Those  deductions 
include "[n]et gallons of fuel exported from Kansas," "[n]et gallons of fuel 
sold to the U. S. Government," "[n]et gallons of fuel sold for aviation pur-
poses," and "[n]et gallons of dyed diesel fuel received for the month," the 
very  deductions  described  in  $ 79-3408(d),  ibid.  (emphasis  in  original). 
The  distributor's  tax  liability  is  then  calculated  by  subtracting  the  total 
deductions from the total fuel received, and applying the 2.5 percent han-
dling  allowance  to  the  difference.  Thus,  the  event  that  generates  a  dis-
tributor's tax liability is its receipt of fuel.  And the distributor must pay 
tax on that fuel even if it is not subsequently delivered or sold.  While a 
distributor may decrease its tax liability by engaging in transactions that 
entitle it to deductions, such as by selling or delivering fuel to an exempt 
entity  like  the  United  States,  its  tax  liability  is  unaffected  by  sales  or 
deliveries to nonexempt entities like the Nation.

Opinion of the Court 
actually applied, it must be rejected.4  Second, the availabil-ity  of  tax  deductions  does  not  change  the  nature  of  the  tax-

able  event,  here  the  distributor's  receipt  of  the  fuel.  By analogy,  an  individual  federal  income  taxpayer  may  reduce 
his  tax  liability  by  paying  home  mortgage  interest.  But that entitlement does not render the taxable event anything 
other  than  the  receipt  of  income  by  the  taxpayer.  See 26  U. S. C.  $ 1  (2000  ed.  and  Supp.  II),  $ 163(h)  (2000  ed.); 
cf.  North  American  Oil  Consol.  v.  Burnet,  286  U. S.  417, 424  (1932)  (federal  income  tax  liability  arises  when  "a  tax-
payer . . . has received income"). Finally,  the  Nation  contends  that  its interpretation  of  the 
statute  is  supported  by  Kan.  Stat.  Ann.  $ 79-3417  (1997), which  permits  a  refund--in  certain  circumstances--for  de-
stroyed  fuel.  However,  the  Nation's  interpretation  is  actu-
ally  foreclosed  by  that  section.  Section  79-3417  entitles  a distributor  to  a  "refund  from  the  state  of  the  amount  of 

motor-vehicle fuels  or special fuels tax  paid on any . . . fuels of  100  gallons  or  more  in  quantity,  which  are  lost  or  de-
stroyed  at  any  one  time  while  such  distributor  is  the  owner 
thereof," provided the distributor supplies the required noti-fication  and  documentation  to  the  State.  This  section  illus-

trates that a distributor pays taxes for fuel in its possession that  it  has  not  delivered  or  sold,  and  is  only  entitled  to  the 
refund  described  in  this  section  for  tax  it  has  already  paid 

4 Indeed, the dissent acknowledges that tax is owed on fuel a distributor 
receives and holds in inventory--and thus implicitly concedes that the dis-
tributors' off-reservation receipt of motor fuel is the event that gives rise 
to  tax  liability.  See  post,  at  120  (opinion  of  Ginsburg,

Opinion of the Court 
on  fuel  that  is  subsequently  destroyed.  While  this  section does not specify the event that gives rise to the distributor's 

tax  liability,  it  forecloses  the  Nation's  contention  that  such liability  does  not  arise  until  fuel  is  sold  or  delivered  to  a 
nonexempt entity.  III 

Although  Kansas'  fuel  tax  is  imposed  on  non-Indian  dis-tributors  based  upon  those  distributors'  off-reservation  re-
ceipt of motor fuel, the Tenth Circuit concluded that the tax was  nevertheless  still  subject  to  the  interest-balancing  test 
this  Court  set  forth  in  Bracker,  448  U. S.  136.  As  Bracker itself  explained,  however,  we  formulated  the  balancing  test 
to address the "difficult questio[n]" that arises when "a State asserts  authority  over  the  conduct  of  non-Indians  engaging 
in  activity  on  the  reservation."  Id.,  at  144-145  (emphasis added).  The 

Bracker interest-balancing test has never been applied where, as here, the State asserts its taxing authority 

over non-Indians off the reservation.  And although we have never  addressed this  precise issue,  our  Indian tax  immunity 
cases counsel against such an application. 

A 
We have applied the balancing test articulated in Bracker only where "the legal incidence of the tax fell on a nontribal 

entity  engaged  in  a  transaction  with  tribes  or  tribal  mem-bers,"  Arizona  Dept.  of  Revenue  v.  Blaze  Constr.  Co.,  526 
U. S.  32,  37  (1999),  on  the  reservation.  See  Bracker,  supra (motor  carrier  license  and  use  fuel  taxes  imposed  on  on-
reservation  logging  and  hauling  operations  by  non-Indian contractor); Department of Taxation and Finance of N. Y. v. 
Milhelm  Attea  &  Bros.,  512  U. S.  61  (1994)  (various  taxes imposed  on  non-Indian  purchasers  of  goods  retailed  on-
reservation);  Cotton  Petroleum  Corp.  v.  New  Mexico,  490 U. S.  163  (1989)  (state  severance  tax  imposed  on  non-Indian

Opinion of the Court 
U. S. 832  (1982) (state gross receipts tax imposed  on private contractor's proceeds from the construction of a school on the

imposed on on-reservation purchases by nonmembers); Central  Machinery  Co.,  448  U. S.  160  (tax  imposed  on  on-
reservation sale of farm machinery to Tribe).  Similarly, the cases  identified  in 

Bracker  as  supportive  of  the  balancing test were exclusively concerned with the on-reservation con-

duct  of  non-Indians.  See  Warren  Trading  Post  Co.  v.  Ari-zona  Tax  Comm'n,  380  U. S.  685  (1965)  (gross  proceeds  tax 
imposed  on  non-Indian  retailer  on  Navajo  Indian  Reserva-tion); Thomas v.  Gay, 169 U. S. 264 (1898) (state property tax

5 Our recent discussion in Oklahoma Tax Comm'n v.  Chickasaw Nation, 
515  U. S.  450  (1995),  regarding  the  application  of  the  interest-balancing 
test  to  motor  fuel  taxes  is  not  to  the  contrary.  In  Chickasaw,  we  noted 
in  dicta  that,  "if  the  legal  incidence  of  the  tax  rests  on  non-Indians,  no 
categorical bar prevents enforcement of the tax; if the balance of federal, 
state,  and  tribal  interests  favors  the  State,  and  federal  law  is  not  to  the 
contrary, the State may impose its levy, and may place on a tribe or tribal 
members  `minimal  burdens'  in  collecting  the  toll."  Id.,  at  459  (citation 
omitted).  Chickasaw did not purport to expand the applicability of White 
Mountain  Apache  Tribe  v.  Bracker,  448  U. S.  136  (1980),  to  an  off-
reservation tax on non-Indians.  Indeed, the quoted sentence reveals that 
Chickasaw discussed the applicability of the interest-balancing test in the 
context of a tax that is collected by the tribe--a tax that necessarily arises 
from on-reservation conduct. 

Moreover, in purporting to craft a " `bright-line standard' " in that case, 
we noted  that Oklahoma "generally is  free" to impose the legal incidence 
of its motor fuel tax on the consumer--who purchases fuel on the reserva-
tion--and  then  require  the  Indian  retailers  to  " `collect  and  remit  the 
levy.' "  515  U. S.,  at  460.  If  Oklahoma  would  have  been  free  to  impose 
the  legal  incidence  of  its  fuel  tax  downstream  from  the  Indian  retailers, 
then Kansas should be equally free to impose the legal incidence of its fuel 
tax  upstream  from  Indian  retailers  notwithstanding  the  applicability  of

Opinion of the Court 
Limiting  the  interest-balancing  test  exclusively  to  on-reservation  transactions  between  a  nontribal  entity  and  a 

tribe  or  tribal  member  is  consistent  with  our  unique  Indian tax  immunity  jurisprudence.  We  have  explained  that  this 
jurisprudence relies "heavily on the doctrine of tribal sover-eignty  . . . which  historically gave  state law `no role to play' 
within  a  tribe's  territorial  boundaries."  Oklahoma  Tax 
Comm'n v.  Sac and Fox Nation, 508 U. S. 114, 123-124 (1993) (quoting  McClanahan  v.  Arizona  Tax  Comm'n,  411  U. S. 

164,  168  (1973)).  We  have  further  explained  that  the  doc-trine of tribal sovereignty, which has a "significant geograph-
ical  component,"  Bracker,  supra,  at  151,  requires  us  to  "re-vers[e]"  the  " `general  rule' "  that  " `exemptions  from  tax 
laws should . . . be  clearly expressed.' "  Sac and Fox, supra, at  124  (quoting  McClanahan,  supra,  at  176).  And  we  have 
determined that the geographical component of tribal sover-eignty  " `provide[s]  a  backdrop  against  which  the  applicable 
treaties and federal  statutes must be read.' "  Sac and Fox, 
supra, at 124 (quoting McClanahan, supra, at 172).  Indeed, the particularized inquiry we set forth in Bracker relied spe-

cifically on that backdrop.  See 448 U. S., at 144-145 (noting that  where  "a  State  asserts  authority  over  the  conduct  of 
non-Indians  engaging  in  activity  on  the  reservation  . .  . we  have  examined  the  language  of the  relevant  federal  treaties 
and statutes in terms of both the broad policies that underlie them  and  the  notions  of  sovereignty  that  have  developed 
from  historical  traditions  of  tribal  independence"  (emphasis added)). 

We have taken an altogether different course, by contrast, when  a  State  asserts  its  taxing  authority  outside  of  Indian 
country.  Without  applying  the  interest-balancing  test,  we 
the  interest-balancing  test.  Indeed,  the  Chickasaw  dicta  should  apply 
a  fortiori  here;  the  upstream  approach  is  less  burdensome  on  the  Tribe 
because it does not include the collecting and remitting requirements that 
typically, and permissibly, accompany a consumer tax.

Opinion of the Court 
have  permitted  the  taxation  of  the  gross  receipts  of  an  off-
reservation,  Indian-owned  ski  resort,  Mescalero  Apache 
Tribe  v.  Jones,  411  U. S.  145  (1973),  and  the  taxation  of  in-
come  earned  by  Indians  working  on  reservation  but  living 
off  reservation,  Chickasaw,  515  U. S.  450.  In  these  cases, 
we  have  concluded  that  "[a]bsent  express  federal  law  to  the 
contrary, Indians  going beyond  reservation  boundaries  have 
generally  been  held  subject  to  nondiscriminatory  state  law 
otherwise applicable to all citizens of the State."  Mescalero 
Apache,  supra,  at  148-149;  Chickasaw,  supra,  at  465  (quot-
ing  Mescalero  Apache,  supra,  at  148-149).  If  a  State  may 
apply a nondiscriminatory tax to Indians who have gone be-
yond  the  boundaries  of  the  reservation,  then  it  follows  that 
it may apply a nondiscriminatory tax where, as here, the tax 
is  imposed  on  non-Indians  as  a  result  of  an  off-reservation 
transaction.  In  these  circumstances,  the  interest-balancing 
test  set  forth  in  Bracker  is  inapplicable.  Cf.  Blaze  Constr., 
526  U. S.,  at  37  (declining  to  apply  the  Bracker  interest-
balancing  test  "where  a  State  seeks  to  tax  a  transaction 
[on  reservation]  between  the  Federal  Government  and  its 
non-Indian private contractor"). 

The  application  of  the  interest-balancing  test  to  the  Kan-
sas  motor  fuel  tax  is  not  only  inconsistent  with  the  special 
geographic sovereignty  concerns that  gave  rise  to  that test, 
but  also  with  our  efforts  to  establish  "bright-line  stand-
ard[s]"  in  the  context  of  tax  administration.  526  U. S.,  at 
37  ("The  need  to  avoid  litigation  and  to  ensure  efficient  tax 
administration counsels in favor of a bright-line standard for 
taxation  of  federal  contracts,  regardless  of  whether  the 
contracted-for  activity  takes  place  on  Indian  reservations"); 
cf.  Chickasaw, supra,  at  460  (noting  that  the  legal  incidence 
test " `provide[s] a reasonably bright-line standard' "); 
County  of  Yakima  v.  Confederated  Tribes  and  Bands  of

Opinion of the Court 
"only cloud[s] " our  efforts to establish  such  standards. 
Blaze  Constr.,  supra, at  37.  Under  the  Nation's view,  how-
ever, any off-reservation tax imposed on the manufacture or 
sale  of  any  good  imported  by  the  Nation  or  one  of  its  mem-
bers would be subject to interest balancing.  Such an expan-
sion  of  the  application  of  the  Bracker  test  is  not  supported 
by our cases. 

Nor  is  the  Nation  entitled  to  interest  balancing  by  virtue 
of its claim that the Kansas motor fuel tax interferes with its 
own motor fuel tax.  As an initial matter, this is ultimately a 
complaint  about  the  downstream  economic  consequences  of 
the  Kansas  tax.  As  the  owner  of  the  station,  the  Nation 
will  keep  every  dollar  it  collects  above  its  operating  costs. 
Given  that  the  Nation  sells  gas  at  prevailing  market  rates, 
its  decision  to  impose  a  tax  should  have  no  effect  on  its  net 
revenues from the operation of the station; it should not mat-
ter whether those revenues are labeled "profits" or "tax pro-
ceeds."  The  Nation  merely  seeks  to  increase  those  reve-
nues  by  purchasing  untaxed  fuel.  But  the  Nation  cannot 
invalidate  the  Kansas  tax  by  complaining  about  a  decrease 
in  revenues.  See  Colville,  447  U. S.,  at  156  ("Washington 
does  not  infringe  the  right  of  reservation  Indians  to  `make 
their  own  laws  and  be  ruled  by  them,'  Williams  v.  Lee,  358 
U. S.  217,  220  (1959),  merely  because  the  result  of  imposing 
its taxes will be to deprive the Tribes of revenues which they 
currently are receiving").  Nor would our analysis change if 
we  accorded  legal  significance  to  the  Nation's  decision  to 
label  a  portion  of  the  station's  revenues  as  tax  proceeds. 
See id., at 184, n. 9 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in part, concur-
ing  in  result  in  part,  and  dissenting  in  part)  ("When  two 
sovereigns  have  legitimate  authority  to  tax  the  same  trans-
action,  exercise  of  that  authority  by  one  sovereign  does  not 
oust  the  jurisdiction  of  the  other.  If  it  were  otherwise,  we 
would  not  be  obligated  to  pay  federal  as  well  as  state  taxes 
on our income or gasoline purchases.  Economic burdens on

Opinion of the Court 
the  competing sovereign  . . .  do  not alter the  concurrent na-ture of the taxing authority").

B 
Finally,  the  Nation  contends  that  the  Kansas  motor  fuel tax  is  invalid  notwithstanding  the  inapplicability  of  the 

interest-balancing  test,  because  it  "exempts  from  taxation fuel  sold  or  delivered  to  all  other  sovereigns,"  and  is  there-
fore  impermissibly  discriminatory.  Brief  for  Respondent 17-20  (emphasis  deleted);  Kan.  Stat.  Ann.  $$ 79-3408(d)(1)- 
(2) (2003 Cum. Supp.).  But the Nation is not similarly situ-ated  to  the  sovereigns  exempted  from  the  Kansas  fuel  tax. 
While  Kansas  uses  the  proceeds  from  its  fuel  tax  to  pay  for a  significant  portion  of  the  costs  of  maintaining  the  roads 
and  bridges  on  the  Nation's  reservation,  including  the  main highway  used  by  the  Nation's  casino  patrons,  Kansas  offers 
no such services to the several States or the Federal Govern-ment.  Moreover,  to  the  extent  Kansas  fuel  retailers  bear 
the  cost  of  the  fuel  tax,  that  burden  falls  equally  upon  all retailers within the State regardless of whether those retail-
ers  are  located  on  an  Indian  reservation.  Accordingly,  the Kansas  motor  fuel  tax  is  not  impermissibly  discriminatory. 

* * * 
For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the Kansas motor fuel  tax  is  a  nondiscriminatory  tax  imposed  on  an  off-

reservation  transaction  between  non-Indians.  Accordingly, the  tax  is  valid  and  poses  no  affront  to  the  Nation's  sover-
eignty.  The  judgment  of  the  Court  of  Appeals  is  reversed. 

It is so ordered. 
6 These authorities also foreclose the Nation's contention that the Kansas 
motor  fuel  tax  is  invalid,  irrespective  of  the  applicability  of  Bracker,  448 
U. S. 136, because it interferes with the Nation's right to self-government.

wise  warranted.  Were  the  statute  strictly  jurisdictional,  there  would 
be  no  need  to  limit  awards  to  "just"  costs;  any  award  authorized  by 
other provisions of law would presumably be "just."  The Court there-

courts  to  award  costs  and  fees,  but  only  when  such  an  award  is  just.

with  prejudice.  On  appeal,  the  Court  of  Appeals  for  the 
Tenth Circuit agreed with the Martins that the suit failed to 
satisfy  the  amount-in-controversy  requirement.  The  Tenth 
Circuit rejected Franklin's contention that punitive damages 
and  attorney's  fees  could  be  aggregated  in  calculating  the 
amount  in  controversy,  in  part  on  the  basis  of  decisions  is-
sued after the District Court's remand decision.  The Court 
of Appeals reversed and remanded to the District Court with 
instructions  to  remand  the  case  to  state  court.  251  F.  3d 
1284, 1294 (2001). 

Back before the District Court, the Martins moved for at-
torney's  fees  under  $ 1447(c).  The  District  Court  reviewed 
Franklin's basis for removal and concluded that, although the 
Court  of  Appeals  had  determined  that  removal  was  im-
proper,  Franklin  "had  legitimate  grounds  for  believing  this 
case  fell  within  th[e]  Court's  jurisdiction."  App.  to  Pet.  for 
Cert.  20a.  Because  Franklin  "had  objectively  reasonable 
grounds to believe the removal was legally proper," the Dis-
trict Court denied the Martins' request for fees.  Ibid.

Petitioner  in  No.  04-1236,  Tony  Goodman,  is  a  paraplegic 
inmate  in  the  Georgia  prison  system  who,  at  all  relevant 
times, was housed at the Georgia State Prison in Reidsville. 
After filing numerous administrative grievances in the state 
prison  system,  Goodman  filed  a  pro  se  complaint  in  the 
United  States  District  Court  for  the  Southern  District  of 
Georgia  challenging  the  conditions  of  his  confinement.  He 
named  as  defendants  the  State  of  Georgia  and  the  Georgia 
Department of Corrections (state defendants) and several in-
dividual prison officials.  He brought claims under Rev. Stat. 

$ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, Title II of the ADA, and other pro-

Opinion of the Court 
visions  not  relevant  here,  seeking  both  injunctive  relief  and money damages against all defendants. 

Goodman's  pro  se  complaint  and  subsequent  filings  in  the District  Court  included  many  allegations,  both  grave  and 
trivial,  regarding  the  conditions  of  his  confinement  in  the Reidsville  prison.  Among  his  more  serious  allegations,  he 
claimed that he was confined  for 23-to-24  hours per  day in a 
12-by-3-foot  cell  in  which  he  could  not  turn  his  wheelchair around.  He alleged that the lack of accessible facilities ren-

dered him unable to use the toilet and shower without assist-ance, which was often denied.  On multiple occasions, he as-
serted, he had injured himself in attempting to transfer from 
his  wheelchair  to  the  shower  or  toilet  on  his  own,  and,  on 
several other occasions, he had been  forced to sit  in his own 
feces and urine while prison officials refused to assist him in 
cleaning  up  the  waste.  He  also  claimed  that  he  had  been 
denied  physical  therapy  and  medical  treatment,  and  denied 
access  to  virtually  all  prison  programs  and  services  on  ac-
count of his disability. 

The District Court adopted the Magistrate Judge's recom-
mendation  that  the  allegations  in  the  complaint  were  vague 
and  constituted  insufficient  notice  pleading  as  to  Goodman's 

$ 1983  claims.  It  therefore  dismissed  the  $ 1983  claims 
against all defendants without providing Goodman an oppor-
tunity to amend his complaint.  The District Court also dis-
missed  his  Title  II  claims  against  all  individual  defendants. 
Later,  after  our  decision  in  Garrett,  the  District  Court 
granted summary judgment to the state defendants on Good-
man's  Title II claims for  money damages, holding that  those 
claims were barred by state sovereign immunity. 

Goodman  appealed to the United States  Court of Appeals 
for  the  Eleventh  Circuit.  The  United  States,  petitioner  in 
No.  04-1203,  intervened  to  defend  the  constitutionality  of 
Title II's abrogation of state sovereign immunity.  The Elev-
enth Circuit determined that the District Court had erred in 
dismissing all of Goodman's $ 1983 claims, because Goodman's

multiple pro se filings in the District Court alleged facts suf-ficient  to  support  "a  limited  number  of  Eighth-Amendment

reported  at  120  Fed.  Appx.  785  (2004).  The  Court  of  Ap-peals  held  that  the  District  Court  should  have  given  Good-
man  leave  to  amend  his  complaint  to  develop  three  Eighth 
Amendment claims relating to his conditions of confinement: 

"First,  Goodman  alleges  that  he  is  not  able  to  move  his wheelchair  in  his  cell.  If  Goodman  is  to  be  believed, 

this  effectively  amounts  to  some  form  of  total  restraint twenty-three  to  twenty-four  hours-a-day  without  penal 
justification.  Second,  Goodman  has  alleged  several  in-
stances  in  which  he  was  forced  to  sit  in  his  own  bodily waste  because  prison  officials  refused  to  provide  assist-

ance.  Third, Goodman has alleged sufficient conduct to proceed  with  a  $ 1983  claim  based  on  the  prison  staff 's 
supposed  `deliberate indifference'  to his serious medical condition of being partially paraplegic . . . ."  App. A to 
Pet.  for  Cert.  in  No.  04-1236,  pp.  18a-19a  (citation  and footnote omitted). 

The court remanded the suit to the District Court to permit Goodman to amend his complaint, while cautioning Goodman 
not  to  reassert  all  the  $ 1983  claims  included  in  his  initial complaint,  "some  of  which  [we]re  obviously  frivolous." 

Id., 
at 18a. The  Eleventh  Circuit  did  not  address  the  sufficiency  of 

Goodman's  allegations  under  Title  II.  Instead,  relying  on its prior decision in 

Miller v.  King, 384 F. 3d 1248 (2004), the 
Court  of  Appeals  affirmed  the  District  Court's  holding  that 
Goodman's  Title  II  claims  for  money  damages  against  the 
State were barred by sovereign immunity.  We granted cer-
tiorari to consider whether Title II of the ADA validly abro-
gates state sovereign immunity with respect to the claims at 
issue here.  544 U. S. 1031 (2005).

Opinion of the Court 

II 
In reversing the  dismissal of  Goodman's $ 1983  claims, the Eleventh Circuit held that Goodman had alleged actual viola-

tions  of  the  Eighth  Amendment  by  state  agents  on  the grounds  set  forth  above.  See  App.  A  to  Pet.  for  Cert.  in 
No.  04-1236,  pp.  18a-19a.  The  State  does  not  contest  this holding,  see  Brief  for  Respondents  41-44,  and  we  did  not 
grant  certiorari  to  consider  the  merits  of Goodman's  Eighth Amendment  claims;  we  assume  without  deciding,  therefore, 
that  the  Eleventh  Circuit's  treatment  of  these  claims  was correct.  Moreover,  Goodman  urges,  and the  State  does  not 
dispute,  that  this  same  conduct  that  violated  the  Eighth Amendment  also  violated  Title  II  of  the  ADA.  See  Brief 
for  Petitioner  in  No.  04-1236,  p.  46;  Brief  for  Respondents 41-44.  In fact, it is quite plausible that the alleged deliber-
ate  refusal  of  prison  officials  to  accommodate  Goodman's disability-related needs in such fundamentals as mobility, hy-
giene,  medical  care,  and  virtually  all  other  prison  programs constituted  "exclu[sion]  from  participation  in  or  .  .  .  deni[al 
of] the benefits of " the prison's "services, programs, or activ-ities."  42  U. S. C.  $ 12132;  see  also  Yeskey,  524  U. S.,  at  210 
(noting that the phrase "services, programs, or activities" in $ 12132 includes recreational, medical, educational, and voca-
tional  prison  programs).  Therefore,  Goodman's  claims  for money  damages  against  the  State  under  Title  II  were  evi-
dently based, at least in large part, on conduct that independ-ently violated the provisions of $ 1 of the Fourteenth Amend-
ment.  See Louisiana ex rel. Francis v.  Resweber, 329 U. S. 459, 463 (1947) (plurality opinion) (the Due Process Clause of 
the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates the Eighth Amend-ment's  guarantee  against  cruel  and  unusual  punishment). 
In  this  respect,  Goodman  differs  from  the  claimants  in  our other cases addressing  Congress's  ability  to abrogate sover-
eign immunity pursuant to its $ 5 powers.  See Tennessee v. 
Lane, 541 U. S. 509, 543, n. 4 (2004) (Rehnquist, C. J., dissent-ing)  (respondents  were  not  actually  denied  constitutional

Opinion of the Court 
forcement power includes the power to abrogate state sover-
eign  immunity  by  authorizing  private  suits  for  damages 
against  the  States.  See  Fitzpatrick,  supra,  at  456.  Thus, 
insofar  as Title  II creates a private cause of action for dam-
ages  against  the  States  for  conduct  that  actually  violates 
the Fourteenth Amendment, Title II validly abrogates state 
sovereign immunity.  The Eleventh Circuit erred in dismiss-
ing  those  of  Goodman's  Title  II  claims  that  were  based  on 
such unconstitutional conduct. 

From the many allegations in Goodman's pro se complaint 
and his subsequent filings in the District Court, it is not clear 
precisely  what  conduct  he  intended  to  allege  in  support  of 
his  Title  II  claims.  Because  the  Eleventh  Circuit  did  not 
address  the  issue,  it  is  likewise  unclear  to  what  extent  the 
conduct underlying Goodman's constitutional claims also vio-
lated Title II.  Moreover, the Eleventh Circuit ordered that 
the  suit  be  remanded  to  the  District  Court  to  permit  Good-
man to amend his complaint, but instructed him to revise his 
factual allegations to exclude his "frivolous" claims--some of 
which  are  quite  far  afield  from  actual  constitutional  viola-
tions  (under  either  the  Eighth  Amendment  or  some  other 
constitutional  provision),  or  even  from  Title  II  violations. 
See, e. g., App. 50 (demanding a "steam table" for Goodman's 
housing  unit).  It  is  therefore  unclear  whether  Goodman's 
amended  complaint  will  assert  Title  II  claims  premised  on 
conduct  that  does  not  independently  violate  the  Fourteenth 
Amendment.  Once  Goodman's  complaint  is  amended,  the 
lower  courts  will  be  best  situated  to  determine  in  the  first 
instance,  on  a  claim-by-claim  basis,  (1)  which  aspects  of  the 
State's  alleged  conduct  violated  Title  II;  (2)  to  what  extent 
such  misconduct  also  violated  the  Fourteenth  Amendment; 
and  (3)  insofar  as  such  misconduct  violated  Title  II  but  did 
not violate the Fourteenth Amendment, whether Congress's 
purported abrogation of sovereign immunity as to that class 
of conduct is nevertheless valid.

dealers  received  in  bidding  processes  in  which  Reeder  did  not  partici-
pate.  Reeder also compared concessions Volvo offered it on several oc-
casions when it bid unsuccessfully against non-Volvo dealers (and there-
fore  did  not  purchase  Volvo  trucks),  with  more  favorable  concessions 
accorded other Volvo dealers who gained contracts on which Reeder did 
not bid.  Reeder did not look for instances in which it received a larger 
concession  than  another  Volvo  dealer,  but  acknowledged  it  was  "quite 
possible"  that  such  instances  occurred.  Nor  did  Reeder  offer  any  sta-
tistical analysis revealing whether it was disfavored on average as com-
pared  to  other  dealers.  The  jury  found  a  reasonable  possibility  that 
discriminatory  pricing  may  have  harmed  competition  between  Reeder 
and  other  Volvo  dealers,  that  Volvo's  discriminatory  pricing  injured 
Reeder, and that Reeder's damages from Volvo's Robinson-Patman vio-
lation  exceeded  $1.3  million.  The  District  Court  awarded  treble  dam-
ages on the Robinson-Patman Act claim, and entered judgment. 

Affirming, the Eighth Circuit, among  other things, noted the thresh-
old requirement that Reeder show it was a "purchaser" within the Act's 
meaning; rejected Volvo's contention that competitive bidding situations 
do not give rise to Robinson-Patman claims; held that the four instances 
in which Reeder purchased trucks following successful bids rendered it 
a  purchaser  under  the  Act;  determined  that  a  jury  could  reasonably 
decide  Reeder  was  in  actual  competition  with  favored  dealers  at  the 
time price differentials were imposed; and held that the jury could prop-
erly find Reeder had proved competitive injury based on evidence that 
(1)  Volvo  intended  to  reduce  the  number  of  its  dealers,  (2)  Reeder 

lost  one  contract  for  which  it  competed  with  another  Volvo  dealer, 
(3) Reeder would have earned more profits, had it received the conces-
sions given other dealers, and (4) Reeder's sales declined over time. 

Held:  A manufacturer may not be held liable for secondary-line price dis-

crimination under the Robinson-Patman Act in the absence of a showing 
that  the  manufacturer  discriminated  between  dealers  competing  to  re-
sell  its  product  to  the  same  retail  customer.  The  Act  does  not  reach 
the  case  Reeder  presents.  It  centrally  addresses  price  discrimination 
in  cases  involving  competition  between  different  purchasers  for  resale 
of  the  purchased  product.  Competition  of  that  character  ordinarily  is 
not  involved  when  a  product  subject  to  special  order  is  sold  through  a 
customer-specific competitive bidding process.  Pp. 175-182.

stores  able  to  obtain  lower  prices  for  goods  than  smaller  buyers  could 
demand.  Robinson-Patman  does  not  ban  all  price  differences  charged 
to  different  purchasers  of  similar  commodities,  but  proscribes  only 
"price  discrimination  [that]  threatens  to  injure  competition,"  Brooke 
Group  Ltd.  v.  Brown  &  Williamson  Tobacco  Corp.,  509  U. S.  209,  220. 
Of  the  three  categories  of  competitive  injury  that  may  give  rise  to  a 
Robinson-Patman claim, secondary-line cases, like this one, involve price 
discrimination  that  injures  competition  among  the  discriminating  sell-
er's  customers  (here,  Volvo's  dealerships).  Reeder  has  satisfied  the 
Act's  first  two  requirements  for  establishing  secondary-line  injury: 
(1)  The  relevant  Volvo  truck  sales  were  made  in  interstate  commerce, 
and  (2)  the  trucks  were  of  "like  grade  and  quality,"  15  U. S. C.  $ 13(a). 
Because Reeder  has not identified any  differentially priced transaction 
in which it was both a "purchaser" under the Act and "in actual competi-
tion" with a favored purchaser for the same customer, see, e. g., FTC v. 
Sun  Oil  Co.,  371  U. S.  505,  518-519,  Volvo  and  amicus  United  States 
maintain that Reeder cannot satisfy the Act's third and fourth require-
ments--that  (3)  Volvo  "discriminate[d]  in  price  between"  Reeder  and 
another purchaser of Volvo trucks, and (4) "the effect of such discrimina-
tion may be . . . to injure, destroy, or prevent competition" to the advan-
tage of a favored purchaser, i. e., one who "receive[d] the benefit of such 
discrimination,"  15  U. S. C.  $ 13(a).  Absent  actual  competition  with  a 
favored  Volvo  dealer,  Reeder  cannot  establish  the  competitive  injury 
the Act requires.  Pp. 175-177. 

2. The injury to competition targeted by the Robinson-Patman Act is 
not established by the selective comparisons Reeder presented at trial: 
(1) comparisons of concessions Reeder received for four successful bids 
against  non-Volvo  dealers,  with  larger  concessions  other  successful 
Volvo dealers  received for  different  sales  on which  Reeder did  not  bid 
(purchase-to-purchase  comparisons);  (2)  comparisons  of  concessions  of-
fered  to  Reeder  in  connection  with  several  unsuccessful  bids  against 
non-Volvo dealers, with greater concessions accorded other Volvo deal-
ers who competed successfully for  different sales  on which Reeder did 
not bid (offer-to-purchase comparisons); and (3) comparisons of two occa-
sions  on  which  Reeder  bid  against  another  Volvo  dealer  (head-to-head 
comparisons).  Pp. 177-180. 

(a)  Because  the  purchase-to-purchase  and  offer-to-purchase  com-
parisons fail to show that Volvo sold at a lower price to Reeder's "com-
petitors," those comparisons do not support an inference of competitive 
injury.  See  Falls  City  Industries,  Inc.  v.  Vanco  Beverage,  Inc.,  460 
U. S.  428,  435.  Both  types  of  comparisons  fall  short  because  in  none 
of  the  discrete  instances  on  which  Reeder  relied  did  it  compete  with 
beneficiaries of the alleged discrimination for the same customer.  Nor

Syllabus 
did Reeder  even attempt to show  that the compared  dealers were con-
sistently  favored  over  it.  Reeder  simply  paired  occasions  on  which  it 
competed  with  non-Volvo  dealers  for  a  sale  to  Customer  A  with  in-
stances in which  other Volvo dealers competed  with non-Volvo dealers 
for a sale to Customer B.  The compared incidents were tied to no sys-
tematic study and were separated in time by as many as seven months. 
This  Court  declines  to  permit  an  inference  of  competitive  injury  from 
evidence of such a mix-and-match, manipulable quality.  No similar risk 
of  manipulation  occurs in  cases kin to the chainstore  paradigm.  Here, 
there  is  no  discrete  "favored"  dealer  comparable  to  a  chainstore  or  a 
large  independent department  store--at  least, Reeder's  evidence is  in-
sufficient to support an inference that such a dealer exists.  For all that 
appears, Reeder, on occasion, might  have gotten a better deal vis-a`-vis 
one or more of the dealers in its comparisons.  While Reeder may have 
competed with other Volvo dealers for the opportunity to bid on poten-
tial sales in a broad geographic area, competition at that initial stage is 
based on a  variety of factors, including the existence vel non of a rela-
tionship between the potential bidder and the customer, geography, and 
reputation.  Once the customer has chosen the  particular dealers from 
which  it  will  solicit  bids,  the  relevant  market  becomes  limited  to  the 
needs  and  demands  of  the  particular  end  user,  with  only  a  handful  of 
dealers competing for the  sale.  Volvo dealers' bidding  for sales in  the 
same  geographic  area  does  not  import  that  they  in  fact  competed  for 
the same customer-tailored sales.  Pp. 178-179. 

(b)  Nor is a Robinson-Patman violation established by Reeder's ev-
idence of two instances in which it competed head to head with another 
Volvo dealer.  When  multiple dealers  bid for  the business  of  the  same 
customer, only one dealer will win the business and thereafter purchase 
the  supplier's  product  to  fulfill  its  contractual  commitment.  Even  as-
suming  the  Act  applies  to  head-to-head  transactions,  Reeder  did  not 
establish that it was disfavored vis-a`-vis other Volvo dealers in the rare 
instances in which they competed for the same sale--let alone that the 
alleged discrimination was substantial.  Reeder's evidence showed loss 
of only one sale to another Volvo dealer, a sale of 12 trucks that would 
have generated $30,000 in gross profits for Reeder.  Per its policy, Volvo 
initially  offered  Reeder  and  the  other  dealer  the  same  concession,  but 
ultimately  granted  a  larger  concession  to  the  other  dealer  after  it  had 
won  the  bid.  In  the  only  other  instance  of  head-to-head  competition, 
Volvo increased  Reeder's initial  discount to  match  the  discount offered 
the  other  competing  Volvo  dealer,  but  neither  dealer  won  the  bid.  If 
price  discrimination  between  two  purchasers  existed  at  all,  it  was  not 
of such magnitude as to affect substantially competition between Reeder 
and the "favored" Volvo dealer.  Pp. 179-180.

3. The Robinson-Patman Act signals no large departure from antitrust 
law's  primary  concern,  interbrand  competition.  Even  if  the  Act's  text 
could  be  construed  as  Reeder  urges  and  the  Eighth  Circuit  held,  this 
Court  would resist  interpretation geared more to the  protection of  ex-
isting competitors than to the stimulation of competition.  There is no 
evidence here that any favored  purchaser possesses market power, the 
allegedly favored purchasers are dealers with little resemblance to large 
independent  department  stores  or  chain  operations,  and  the  supplier's 
selective price discounting fosters competition among suppliers of differ-
ent  brands.  By  declining  to  extend  Robinson-Patman's  governance  to 
such  cases,  the  Court  continues  to  construe  the  Act  consistently  with 
antitrust law's broader policies.  Pp. 180-181.

Volvo manufactures heavy-duty trucks.  Reeder sells new 
and used trucks, including heavy-duty trucks.  374 F. 3d 701, 704  (CA8  2004).  Reeder  became  an  authorized  dealer  of 

Volvo trucks in 1995, pursuant to a five-year franchise agree-ment  that  provided  for  automatic  one-year  extensions  if 
Reeder  met  sales  objectives  set  by  Volvo.  Ibid.  Reeder generally  sold  Volvo's  trucks  through  a  competitive  bidding 
process.  Ibid.  In  this  process,  the  retail  customer  de-
scribes  its  specific  product  requirements  and  invites  bids from several dealers it selects.  The customer's "decision to 

request a bid from a particular dealer or to allow a particular dealer to bid is controlled by such factors as an existing rela-
tionship,  geography,  reputation,  and  cold  calling  or  other marketing  strategies  initiated  by  individual  dealers." 

Id., 
at  719  (Hansen,  J.,  concurring  in  part  and  dissenting  in part). 

Once a Volvo dealer receives the customer's specifications, it turns to Volvo and  requests a discount  or "concession" off 
the wholesale price (set at 80% of the published retail price). 
Id., at 704.  It is common practice in the industry for manu-facturers to offer customer-specific discounts to their dealers. 

Ibid.;  App.  334,  337.  Volvo  decides  on  a  case-by-case  basis whether to offer a discount and, if so, what the discount rate 
will  be,  taking  account  of  such  factors  as  industry-wide  de-mand and whether the retail customer has, historically, pur-
chased a different brand of trucks.  App. 348-349, 333-334.1 The dealer then uses the discount offered by Volvo in prepar-

Ibid. 
Reeder  was  one  of  many  Volvo  dealers,  each  assigned  by Volvo  to  a  geographic  territory.  Reeder's  territory  encom-

passed ten  counties in  Arkansas  and two in  Oklahoma.  374 F.  3d,  at  709.  Although  nothing  prohibits  a  Volvo  dealer 
from  bidding  outside  its  territory,  ibid.,  Reeder  rarely  bid 
against  another  Volvo  dealer,  see  id.,  at  705;  5  App.  in No.  02-2462  (CA8),  pp.  1621-1622  (hereinafter  C.  A.  App.). 

In the atypical event that the same retail customer solicited a bid from more than one Volvo dealer, Volvo's stated policy 
was to provide the same price concession to each dealer com-
peting  head  to  head  for  the  same  sale.  4  id.,  at  1161-1162; 
5 id., at 1619, 1621. 

In  1997,  Volvo  announced  a  program  it  called  "Volvo  Vi-
sion,"  in  which  the  company  addressed  problems  it  faced  in 
the  market  for  heavy  trucks,  among  them,  the  company's 
assessment  that  it  had  too  many  dealers.  Volvo  projected 
enlarging  the  size  of  its  dealers'  markets  and  reducing  the 
number of dealers from 146 to 75.  374 F. 3d, at 705.  Coinci-
dentally, Reeder learned that Volvo had given another dealer 
a price concession greater than the concessions Reeder typi-
cally received, and "Reeder came to suspect it was one of the 
dealers Volvo sought to eliminate."  Ibid.  Reeder filed suit 
against  Volvo  in  February  2000,  alleging  losses  attributable 
to Volvo's violation of the Arkansas Franchise Practices Act 
and the Robinson-Patman Act. 

At  trial,  Reeder's  vice-president,  William  E.  Heck,  ac-
knowledged  that  Volvo's  policy  was  to  offer  equal  conces-
sions to Volvo dealers bidding against one another for a par-
ticular  contract,  but  he  contended  that  the  policy  "was  not 
executed."  4 C.  A.  App. 1162.  Reeder  presented evidence 
concerning two instances over the five-year course of its au-
thorized  dealership  when  Reeder  bid  against  other  Volvo 
dealers  for  a  particular  sale.  374  F.  3d,  at  705,  708-709.

Tommy Davidson Trucking.  4 C. A. App. 1267-1268.  Volvo initially  offered  Reeder  a  concession  of  17%,  which  Volvo, 

unprompted, increased to 18.1% and then, one week later, to 18.9%, to  match the concession Volvo had offered  to another 
of its dealers.  5 id., at 1268-1272.  Neither dealer won the bid. 

Id.,  at  1272.  The  other  instance  involved  Hiland 
Dairy, which solicited bids from both Reeder and Southwest 
Missouri  Truck  Center.  Id.,  at  1626-1627.  Per  its  written policy,  Volvo  offered  the  two  dealers  the  same  concession, 

and Hiland selected Southwest Missouri, a dealer from which Hiland  had  previously  purchased  trucks. 

Ibid.  After  se-
lecting  Southwest  Missouri,  Hiland  insisted  on  the  price 
Southwest  Missouri  had  bid  prior  to  a  general  increase  in 
Volvo's  prices;  Volvo  obliged  by  increasing  the  size  of  the 
discount.  Id., at 1627.  See also id., at 1483-1488; 374 F. 3d, 
at 720 (Hansen, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). 

Reeder  dominantly  relied  on  comparisons  between  con-
cessions  Volvo  offered  when  Reeder  bid  against  non-Volvo 
dealers,  with  concessions  accorded  to  other  Volvo  dealers 
similarly  bidding  against  non-Volvo  dealers  for  other  sales. 
Reeder's evidence compared concessions Reeder received on 
four  occasions  when  it  bid  successfully  against  non-Volvo 
dealers (and thus purchased Volvo trucks), with more favor-
able  concessions  other  successful  Volvo  dealers  received  in 
connection  with  bidding  processes  in  which  Reeder  did  not 
participate.  Id., at 705-706.  Reeder also compared conces-
sions offered by Volvo on several occasions when Reeder bid 
unsuccessfully  against  non-Volvo  dealers  (and  therefore  did 
not purchase Volvo trucks), with more favorable concessions 
received  by  other  Volvo  dealers  who  gained  contracts  on 
which Reeder did not bid.  Id., at 706-707. 

Reeder's  vice-president,  Heck,  testified  that  Reeder  did 
not look for instances in which it received a larger concession 
than another Volvo dealer, although he acknowledged it was

Opinion of the Court 
tistical  analysis  whether  Reeder  was  disfavored  on  average as  compared  to  another  dealer  or  set  of  dealers.  Id.,  at 

1462-1464. The jury found that there was a reasonable possibility that 
discriminatory  pricing  may  have  harmed  competition  be-tween  Reeder  and  other  Volvo  truck  dealers,  and  that  Vol-
vo's  discriminatory  pricing  injured  Reeder.  App.  480-486. It  further  found  that  Reeder 's  damages  from  Volvo's 
Robinson-Patman  Act  violation  exceeded  $1.3  million.  Id., at  486.

2  The  District  Court  summarily  denied  Volvo's  mo-

tion for judgment as a matter of law and the company's alter-native  motion  for  new  trial  or  remittitur,  awarded  treble 

damages  on  the  Robinson-Patman  Act  claim,  and  entered judgment. 

A  divided  Court  of  Appeals  for  the  Eighth  Circuit  af-firmed.  The  appeals  court  noted  that,  "as  a  threshold  mat-
ter[,]  Reeder  had  to  show  [that]  it  was  a  `purchaser'  within the  meaning of the  [Act]," 374  F. 3d, at 708, 

i. e., that "there were  actual  sales  at  two  different  prices[,]  .  .  .  a  sale  to 

[Reeder] and a sale to another Volvo dealer," id., at 707-708. Rejecting  Volvo's  contention that  competitive bidding situa-
tions  do  not  give  rise  to  claims  under  the  Robinson-Patman Act, 

id.,  at  708-709,  the  Court  of  Appeals  observed  that Reeder  was  "more  than  an  unsuccessful  bidder,"  id.,  at  709. 

The  four  instances  in  which  Reeder  "actually  purchased Volvo  trucks  following  successful  bids  on  contracts,"  the 
court  concluded,  sufficed  to  render  Reeder  a  purchaser within the meaning of the Act.  Ibid. 

The  Court  of  Appeals  next  determined  that  a  jury  could reasonably  decide  that  Reeder  was  "in  actual  competition" 
with  favored  dealers.  Ibid.  "[A]s  of  the  time  the  price differential  was  imposed,"  the  court  reasoned,  "the  favored 

2 The jury also awarded Reeder damages of $513,750 on Reeder's state-
law  claim  under  the  Arkansas  Franchise  Practices  Act.  No  question  is 
before us respecting that claim, which trained on Volvo's alleged design to 
eliminate Reeder as a Volvo dealer.  See supra, at 171.

(quoting  Best  Brands  Beverage,  Inc.  v.  Falstaff  Brewing 
Corp.,  842  F.  2d  578,  585  (CA2  1987)).  The  court  further 
held that the jury could properly find from the evidence that 
Reeder had proved competitive injury from price discrimina-
tion.  Specifically,  the  court  pointed  to  evidence  showing 
that  (1)  Volvo  intended  to  reduce  the  number  of  its  dealers; 
(2)  Reeder  lost  the  Hiland  Dairy  contract,  for  which  it  com-
peted  head  to  head  with  another  Volvo  dealer;  (3)  Reeder 
would  have  earned  more  profits,  had  it  received  the  conces-
sions  other  dealers  received;  and  (4)  Reeder's  sales  had  de-
clined  over  a  period  of  time.  374  F.  3d,  at  711-712.  The 
court  also  affirmed  the  award  of  treble  damages  to  Reeder. 
Id., at 712-714. 

Judge  Hansen  dissented  as  to  the  Robinson-Patman  Act 
claim.  "Traditional  [Robinson-Patman  Act]  cases,"  he  ob-
served, "involve sellers and purchasers that carry inventory 
or deal in fungible goods."  Id., at 718.  The majority, Judge 
Hansen  commented,  "attempt[ed]  to  fit  a  square  peg  into  a 
round  hole,"  ibid.,  when  it  extended  the  Act's  reach  to  the 
marketplace  for  heavy-duty  trucks,  where  "special-order 
products are sold to individual, pre-identified customers only 
after competitive bidding," ibid.  There may be competition 
among  dealers  for  the  opportunity  to  bid  on  potential  sales, 
he noted, but "[o]nce bidding begins, . . . the relevant market 
becomes  limited  to  the  needs  and  demands  of  a  particular 
end  user,  with  only  a  handful  of  dealers  competing  for  the 
ultimate  sale."  Id.,  at  719.  Violation  of  the  Act,  in  Judge 
Hansen's  view,  could  not  be  predicated  on  the  instances 
Reeder identified in which it was a purchaser, for "there was 
no  actual  competition  between"  Reeder  and  another  Volvo 
dealer  at  the  time  of  Reeder's  purchases.  Ibid.  "Without 
proof of actual competition" for the same customer when the 
requisite  purchases  were  made,  he  concluded,  "Reeder  can-

not  demonstrate  a  reasonable  possibility  of  competitive  in-jury."  Ibid. 

We granted certiorari, 544 U. S. 903 (2005), to resolve this question:  May  a  manufacturer  be  held  liable  for  secondary-
line  price  discrimination  under  the  Robinson-Patman  Act  in the  absence  of  a  showing  that  the  manufacturer  discrimi-
nated between dealers competing to resell its product to the same  retail  customer?  Satisfied  that  the  Court  of  Appeals 
erred  in  answering  that  question  in  the  affirmative,  we  re-verse the Eighth Circuit's judgment. 

II 
Section 2, "when originally enacted as part of the Clayton Act in 1914, was born of a desire by Congress to curb the use 

by financially powerful corporations of localized price-cutting tactics  which  had  gravely  impaired  the  competitive  position 
of  other  sellers."  FTC  v.  Anheuser-Busch,  Inc.,  363  U. S. 536, 543, and n. 6 (1960) (citing H. R. Rep. No. 627, 63d Cong., 
2d  Sess.,  8  (1914);  S.  Rep.  No.  698,  63d  Cong.,  2d  Sess., 2-4  (1914)).  Augmenting  that  provision  in  1936  with  the 
Robinson-Patman  Act,  Congress  sought  to  target  the  per-ceived  harm  to  competition  occasioned  by  powerful  buyers, 
rather  than  sellers;  specifically,  Congress  responded  to  the advent of large chainstores, enterprises with the clout to ob-
tain  lower  prices  for  goods  than  smaller  buyers  could  de-mand.  See  14  H.  Hovenkamp,  Antitrust  Law  || 2302,  p.  11 
(2d  ed.  2006)  (hereinafter  Hovenkamp);  P.  Areeda  &  L. Kaplow, Antitrust  Analysis  || 602, pp.  908-909 (5th  ed.  1997) 
(hereinafter  Areeda).  The  Act  provides,  in  relevant  part: 

"It  shall  be  unlawful  for  any  person  engaged  in  com-merce . . . to discriminate in price between different pur-

chasers  of  commodities  of  like  grade  and  quality,  .  .  . where the effect of such discrimination may be substan-
tially to lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce, or to injure, destroy, or prevent 
competition with any person who either grants or know-

ingly receives the benefit of such discrimination, or with customers  of  either  of  them  . . . ."   15 U.  S.  C. $  13(a).  

Pursuant  to  $ 4  of  the  Clayton  Act,  a  private  plaintiff  may recover  threefold  for  actual  injury  sustained  as  a  result  of 
a  violation  of  the  Robinson-Patman  Act.  See  15  U. S. C. $ 15(a);  J.  Truett  Payne  Co.  v.  Chrysler  Motors  Corp.,  451 
U. S. 557, 562 (1981). Mindful  of  the  purposes  of  the  Act  and  of  the  antitrust 
laws  generally,  we  have  explained  that  Robinson-Patman does  not  "ban  all  price  differences  charged  to  different  pur-
chasers  of  commodities  of  like  grade  and  quality,"  Brooke 
Group Ltd. v.  Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 509 U. S. 209,  220  (1993)  (internal  quotation  marks  omitted);  rather, 

the  Act  proscribes  "price  discrimination  only  to  the  extent that it threatens to injure competition," ibid.  Our decisions 
describe  three  categories  of  competitive  injury  that  may give rise to a Robinson-Patman Act claim: primary line, sec-
ondary line, and tertiary line.  Primary-line cases entail con-duct--most  conspicuously,  predatory  pricing--that  injures 
competition  at  the  level  of  the  discriminating  seller  and  its direct  competitors.  See,  e. g.,  id.,  at  220-222;  see  also  Ho-
venkamp  || 2301a,  pp.  4-6.  Secondary-line  cases,  of  which this is one, involve price discrimination that injures competi-
tion  among  the  discriminating  seller's  customers  (here,  Vol-vo's dealerships); cases in this category typically refer to "fa-
vored"  and  "disfavored"  purchasers.  See  ibid.;  Texaco  Inc. v. 

Hasbrouck,  496  U. S.  543,  558,  n.  15  (1990).  Tertiary-line cases  involve  injury  to  competition  at  the  level  of  the  pur-

chaser's customers.  See Areeda || 601e, p. 907. To  establish  the  secondary-line  injury  of  which  it  com-
plains, Reeder had to show that (1) the relevant Volvo truck sales were made in interstate commerce; (2) the trucks were 
of "like grade and quality"; (3) Volvo "discriminate[d] in price between" Reeder and another purchaser of Volvo trucks; and 
(4)  "the  effect  of  such  discrimination  may  be  .  .  .  to  injure, destroy,  or  prevent  competition"  to  the  advantage  of  a  fa-

Opinion of the Court 
vored purchaser, i. e., one who "receive[d] the benefit of such discrimination."  15  U. S. C.  $ 13(a).  It  is  undisputed  that 

Reeder  has  satisfied  the  first  and  second  requirements. Volvo and the United States, as amicus curiae, maintain that 
Reeder cannot satisfy the third and fourth requirements, be-cause  Reeder  has  not  identified  any  differentially  priced 
transaction in which it was both a "purchaser" under the Act and "in actual competition" with a favored purchaser for the 
same customer. A  hallmark  of  the  requisite  competitive  injury,  our  deci-
sions indicate, is the diversion of sales or profits from a disfa-vored  purchaser  to  a  favored  purchaser. 

FTC  v.  Sun  Oil Co., 371 U. S. 505, 518-519 (1963) (evidence showed patronage 

shifted  from  disfavored  dealers  to  favored  dealers);  Falls City  Industries,  Inc.  v.  Vanco  Beverage,  Inc.,  460  U. S.  428, 
437-438, and n. 8 (1983) (complaint "supported by direct evi-dence  of  diverted  sales").  We  have  also  recognized  that  a 
permissible  inference  of  competitive  injury  may  arise  from evidence  that  a  favored  competitor  received  a  significant 
price reduction over a substantial period of time.  See FTC v. 

Morton  Salt  Co.,  334  U. S.  37,  49-51  (1948);  Falls  City Industries,  460  U. S.,  at  435.  Absent  actual  competition 

with  a  favored  Volvo  dealer, however,  Reeder  cannot  estab-lish the competitive injury required under the Act. 

III 
The  evidence  Reeder  offered  at  trial  falls  into  three  cate-gories:  (1)  comparisons  of  concessions  Reeder  received  for 

four  successful  bids  against  non-Volvo  dealers,  with  larger concessions  other  successful  Volvo  dealers  received  for  dif-
ferent  sales  on  which  Reeder  did  not  bid  (purchase-to-purchase  comparisons);  (2)  comparisons  of  concessions 
offered  to  Reeder  in  connection  with  several  unsuccessful bids  against  non-Volvo  dealers,  with  greater  concessions 
accorded  other  Volvo  dealers  who  competed  successfully for 

different  sales  on  which  Reeder  did  not  bid  (offer-to-

Opinion of the Court 

purchase  comparisons); and  (3)  evidence  of two  occasions  on which Reeder bid against another Volvo dealer (head-to-head 

comparisons).  The Court of Appeals concluded that Reeder demonstrated  competitive  injury  under  the  Act  because 
Reeder competed with favored purchasers "at the same func-tional  level  .  .  .  and  within  the  same  geographic  market." 
374 F. 3d, at 709 (quoting Best Brands, 842 F. 2d, at 585).  As we see it, however, selective comparisons of the kind Reeder 
presented do not show the injury to competition targeted by the Robinson-Patman Act. 

A 
Both  the  purchase-to-purchase  and  the  offer-to-purchase comparisons  fall  short,  for  in  none  of  the  discrete  instances 

on which Reeder relied did Reeder compete with beneficiar-ies  of  the  alleged  discrimination  for  the  same  customer. 
Nor  did  Reeder  even  attempt  to  show  that  the  compared dealers were consistently favored vis-a` -vis Reeder.  Reeder 
simply paired occasions on which it competed with non-Volvo dealers  for  a  sale  to  Customer  A  with  instances  in  which 
other  Volvo  dealers  competed  with  non-Volvo  dealers  for  a sale  to  Customer  B.  The  compared  incidents  were  tied  to 
no systematic study and were separated in time by as many as seven months.  See 374 F. 3d, at 706, 710. 

We  decline  to  permit  an  inference  of  competitive  injury from evidence of such a mix-and-match, manipulable quality. 
See Tr. of Oral Arg. 34-35, 55.  No similar risk of manipula-tion  occurs  in  cases  kin  to  the  chainstore  paradigm.  Here, 
there  is  no  discrete  "favored"  dealer  comparable  to  a  chain-store  or  a  large  independent  department  store--at  least, 
Reeder's  evidence  is  insufficient  to  support  an  inference  of such a dealer or set of dealers.  For all we know, Reeder, on 
occasion,  might  have  gotten  a  better  deal  vis-a` -vis  one  or more  of  the  dealers  in  its  comparisons.  See 

supra,  at  172. Reeder  may  have  competed  with  other  Volvo  dealers  for 

the  opportunity  to  bid  on  potential  sales  in  a  broad  geo-graphic  area.  At  that  initial  stage,  however,  competition  is

Opinion of the Court 
not  affected  by  differential  pricing;  a  dealer  in  the  competi-tive  bidding  process  here  at  issue  approaches  Volvo  for  a 

price  concession  only  after  it  has  been  selected  by  a  retail customer  to  submit  a  bid.  Competition  for  an  opportunity 
to  bid,  we  earlier  observed,  is  based  on  a  variety  of  factors, including the existence vel non of a relationship between the 
potential  bidder  and  the  customer,  geography,  and  reputa-tion.  See 

supra,  at  170.3  We  reiterate  in  this  regard  an observation  made  by  Judge  Hansen,  dissenting  from  the 

Eighth Circuit's Robinson-Patman holding: Once a retail cus-tomer  has  chosen  the  particular  dealers  from  which  it  will 
solicit  bids,  "the  relevant  market  becomes  limited  to  the needs  and  demands  of  a  particular  end  user,  with  only  a 
handful  of  dealers  competing  for  the  ultimate  sale."  374 F.  3d,  at  719.  That  Volvo  dealers  may  bid  for  sales  in  the 
same geographic area does not import that they in fact com-peted  for  the  same  customer-tailored  sales.  In  sum,  the 
purchase-to-purchase  and  offer-to-purchase  comparisons  fail to show that Volvo sold at a lower price to Reeder's "compet-
itors,"  hence  those  comparisons  do  not  support  an  inference of  competitive injury.  See 

Falls  City Industries,  460  U. S., at  435  (inference  of  competitive  injury  under  Morton  Salt 

arises  from  "proof  of  a  substantial  price  discrimination  be-tween  competing  purchasers  over  time"  (emphasis  added)). 

B 
Reeder did offer evidence of two instances in which it com-peted  head  to  head  with  another  Volvo  dealer.  See 

supra, at  171-172.  When  multiple  dealers  bid  for  the  business  of 

the  same  customer,  only  one  dealer  will  win  the  business and  thereafter  purchase  the  supplier's  product  to  fulfill  its 

3 A dealer's reputation for securing favorable concessions, we recognize, 
may  influence  the  customer's  bidding  invitations.  Cf.  post,  at  183,  n.  2. 
We  do  not  pursue  that  point  here,  however,  because  Reeder  did  not 
present--or  even  look  for--evidence  that  Volvo  consistently  disfavored 
Reeder  while  it  consistently  favored  certain  other  dealers.  See  supra, 
at 172-173.

contractual  commitment.  Because  Robinson-Patman  "pro-
hibits  only  discrimination  `between  different  purchasers,' "  
Brief  for  Petitioner  26  (quoting  15  U. S. C.  $ 13(a);  emphasis 
added),  Volvo  and  the  United  States  argue,  the  Act  does 
not reach markets characterized by competitive bidding and 
special-order sales, as opposed to sales from inventory.  See 
Brief  for  Petitioner  27;  Brief  for  United  States  as  Amicus 
Curiae  9,  17-20.  We  need  not  decide  that  question  today. 
Assuming  the  Act  applies  to  the  head-to-head  transactions, 
Reeder  did  not  establish  that  it  was  disfavored  vis-a` -vis 
other Volvo dealers in the rare instances in which they com-
peted for the  same sale--let alone that  the alleged discrimi-
nation  was  substantial.  See  1  ABA  Section  of  Antitrust 
Law,  Antitrust  Law  Developments  478-479  (5th  ed.  2002) 
("No  inference  of  injury  to  competition  is  permitted  when 
the discrimination is not substantial." (collecting cases)). 

Reeder's evidence showed  loss of only  one sale to another 
Volvo  dealer,  a  sale  of  12  trucks  that  would  have  generated 
$30,000  in  gross  profits  for  Reeder.  374  F.  3d,  at  705.  Per 
its policy, Volvo initially offered Reeder and the other dealer 
the same concession.  Volvo ultimately granted a larger con-
cession  to  the  other  dealer,  but  only  after  it  had  won  the 
bid.  In the only other instance of head-to-head competition 
Reeder  identified,  Volvo  increased  Reeder's  initial  17%  dis-
count  to  18.9%,  to  match  the  discount  offered  to  the  other 
competing  Volvo  dealer;  neither  dealer  won  the  bid.  See 
supra, at 172.  In short, if price discrimination between two 
purchasers  existed  at  all,  it  was  not  of  such  magnitude  as 
to  affect  substantially  competition  between  Reeder  and  the 
"favored" Volvo dealer.

Opinion of the Court 
main  concern.  Even  if  the  Act's  text  could  be  construed  in 
the  manner urged  by Reeder  and  embraced by the  Court  of 
Appeals,  we  would  resist  interpretation  geared  more  to  the 
protection of existing competitors than to the stimulation of 
competition.4  In  the  case  before  us,  there  is  no  evidence 
that  any  favored  purchaser  possesses  market  power,  the  al-
legedly  favored  purchasers  are  dealers  with  little  resem-
blance to large independent department stores or chain oper-
ations,  and  the  supplier's  selective  price  discounting  fosters 
competition among suppliers of different brands.  See id., at 
51-52  (observing  that  the  market  impact  of  a  vertical  prac-
tice, such as a change in a supplier's distribution system, may 
be  a  "simultaneous  reduction  of  intrabrand  competition  and 
stimulation of interbrand competition").  By declining to ex-
tend  Robinson-Patman's  governance  to  such  cases,  we  con-
tinue to construe the Act "consistently with broader policies 
of  the  antitrust  laws."  Brooke  Group,  509  U. S.,  at  220 
(quoting  Great  Atlantic  &  Pacific  Tea  Co.  v.  FTC,  440  U. S. 
69, 80, n. 13 (1979)); see Automatic  Canteen Co. of America 
v.  FTC, 346 U. S. 61,  63 (1953) (cautioning  against RobinsonPatman  constructions  that  "extend  beyond  the  prohibitions 
of the Act and, in doing so, help give rise to a price uniform-
ity  and  rigidity  in  open  conflict  with  the  purposes  of  other 
antitrust legislation").5 

4 The dissent assails Volvo's decision to reduce the number of its dealers. 
Post,  at  183.  But  Robinson-Patman  does  not  bar  a  manufacturer  from 
restructuring its distribution networks to improve the efficiency of its op-
erations.  If  Volvo  did  not  honor  its  obligations  to  Reeder  as  its  fran-
chisee, "[a]ny remedy . . . lies in state laws addressing unfair competition 
and  the  rights  of  franchisees,  not  in  the  Robinson-Patman  Act."  Brief 
for United States as Amicus Curiae 28.

cuit's  expansive  interpretation  "views  the  [Robinson-Patman  Act]  as  a 
guarantee  of  equal  profit  margins  on  sales  actually  made,"  and  thereby 
exposes  manufacturers  to  treble  damages  unless  they  "charge  uniform 
prices to their dealers").

Opinion of the Court 
Some  of  these  cases  will  involve  filing  delays,  and  some  of 
those  delays  will  require  the  federal  courts  to  determine 
whether  a  petition  for  appellate  review  in  a  related  state 
collateral proceeding was timely.  Given the uncertain scope 
of California's "reasonable time" standard, it may not be easy 
for the Circuit to decide in each such case whether the pris-
oner's state-court review petition was timely.  And it is con-
sequently not  surprising that  the  Circuit  has  tried  to create 
rules of thumb that look to the label the California Supreme 
Court applied to the denial order, even where that label does 
not refer to timeliness.  For the reasons we gave in Saffold,

permitted the sentencer to consider aggravating factors different from, 
or  in  addition  to,  the  eligibility  factors.  This  weighing/non-weighing 
scheme seems needlessly complex and incapable of providing for the full 
range  of  variations.  This Court  is  henceforth  guided  by  the  following 
rule:  An  invalidated  sentencing  factor  (whether  an  eligibility  factor  or 
not) will render the sentence unconstitutional by reason of its adding an 
improper element to the aggravation scale in the weighing process un-
less  one  of  the  other  sentencing  factors  enables  the  sentencer  to  give 
aggravating weight to the same facts and circumstances.  Pp. 216-221.

ers'  case  gave  rise  to  no  constitutional  violation.  In  California,  the 
"special  circumstances"  listed  in  $ 190.2  are  the  eligibility  factors  de-
signed  to  satisfy  Furman's  narrowing  requirement.

tencer's consideration of an invalid eligibility factor amounts to constitutional error in a  non-weighing State  in  two situa-

tions.  First,  due  process  requires  a  defendant's  death  sen-tence  to  be  set  aside  if  the  reason  for  the  invalidity  of  the 
eligibility factor is that it "authorizes a jury to draw adverse inferences  from  conduct  that  is  constitutionally  protected," 
or  that  it  "attache[s]  the  `aggravating'  label  to  factors  that are constitutionally impermissible or totally irrelevant to the 
sentencing  process,  .  .  .  or  to  conduct  that  actually  should militate in favor of a lesser penalty."

aside  the  weighing/non-weighing  dichotomy  and  proceeding to  the  more  direct  analysis  set  forth  earlier  in  this  opinion: 

All of the aggravating facts and circumstances that the inval-idated  factor  permitted  the  jury  to  consider  were  also  open 
to their  proper consideration under  one of the other factors. The erroneous factor could not  have "skewed"  the  sentence, 
and no constitutional violation occurred. More  specifically, Sanders'  jury  found  four special  circum-
stances  to  be  true:  that  "[t]he  murder  was  committed  while the defendant was engaged in . . . Robbery," $ 190.2(a)(17)(A) 
(West Supp. 2005); that it was "committed while the defend-ant  was  engaged  in . . .  Burglary  in  the  first  or  second  de-
gree,"  $ 190.2(a)(17)(G);  that  "[t]he  victim  [Allen]  was  a  wit-ness to a crime who was intentionally killed for the purpose 
of preventing . . . her testimony in any criminal . . . proceed-ing,"  $ 190.2(a)(10);  and  that  "[t]he  murder  was  especially 
heinous,  atrocious,  or  cruel,"  $ 190.2(a)(14).  The  California Supreme Court set  aside the burglary-murder special 
circumstance  under  state  merger  law  because  the  instruc-tions  permitted  the  jury  to  find  a  burglary  (and  thus  the 
burglary-murder special circumstance) based on Sanders' in-tent to commit assault, which is already an element of homi-
cide,  see  People

some  terminally  ill  state  residents  challenged  the  Rule.  The  District 
Court permanently enjoined its enforcement.  The Ninth Circuit invali-
dated the Rule, reasoning that, by making a medical procedure author-
ized under Oregon law a federal offense, it altered the balance between 
the  States  and  the  Federal  Government  without  the  requisite  clear 
statement  that  the  CSA  authorized  the  action;  and  in  the  alternative, 
that the Rule could not be squared with the CSA's plain language, which 
targets only conventional drug abuse and excludes the Attorney General 
from medical policy decisions. 

Held:  The  CSA  does  not  allow  the  Attorney  General  to  prohibit  doctors 

from  prescribing  regulated  drugs  for  use  in  physician-assisted  suicide 
under state law permitting the procedure.  Pp. 255-275. 

(a)  An administrative rule interpreting the issuing agency's own am-
biguous  regulation  may  receive  substantial  deference.  Auer  v.  Rob-
bins, 519 U. S. 452, 461-463.  So may an interpretation of an ambiguous 
statute,  Chevron  U. S. A.  Inc.  v.  Natural  Resources  Defense  Council, 
Inc.,  467  U. S.  837,  842-845,  but  only  "when  it  appears  that  Congress 
delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the 
force of law, and that the agency interpretation claiming deference was 
promulgated  in  the  exercise  of  that  authority,"  United  States  v.  Mead 
Corp., 533 U. S. 218, 226-227.  Otherwise, the interpretation is "entitled 
to  respect"  only  to  the  extent  it  has  the  "power  to  persuade."  Skid-
more v.  Swift & Co.,  323 U. S. 134, 140.  Pp. 255-256. 

(b)  The  Interpretive  Rule  at  issue  is  not  entitled  to  Auer  deference 
as an interpretation of 21 CFR $ 1306.04.  Unlike the underlying regu-
lations  in  Auer,  which  gave  specificity  to  a  statutory  scheme  the  Sec-
retary  of  Labor  was  charged  with  enforcing  and  reflected  the  Labor 
Department's  considerable  experience  and  expertise,  the  underlying 
regulation  here  does  little  more  than  restate  the  terms  of  the  statute 
itself.  The  CSA  allows  prescription  of  drugs  that  have  a  "currently 
accepted medical use," 21 U. S. C. $ 812(b); requires a "medical purpose" 
for dispensing the least controlled substances of those on the schedules, 

$ 829(c); and defines a "valid prescription" as one "issued for a legitimate 
medical  purpose,"  $ 830(b)(3)(A)(ii).  Similarly,  physicians  are  consid-
ered practitioners if they dispense controlled substances "in the course 
of professional practice."  21 U. S. C. $ 802(21).  The regulation just re-
peats  two  of  these  statutory  phrases  and  attempts  to  summarize  the 
others.  An  agency  does  not  acquire  special  authority  to  interpret  its 
own words when, instead of using its expertise and experience to formu-
late a regulation, it has elected merely to paraphrase the statutory lan-
guage.  Furthermore, any statutory authority for the Interpretive Rule 
would  have  to  come  from  1984  CSA  amendments  adding  the  "public

Syllabus 
interest" requirement, but 21 CFR $ 1306.04 was adopted in 1971.  That 
the current interpretation runs counter to the intent at the time of the 
regulation's promulgation is an additional reason why Auer deference is 
unwarranted.  Pp. 256-258. 

(c)  The  Interpretive  Rule  is  also  not  entitled  to  Chevron  deference. 
The statutory phrase "legitimate medical purpose" is ambiguous in the 
relevant  sense.  However,  Chevron  deference  is  not  accorded  merely 
because  the  statute  is  ambiguous  and  an  administrative  official  is  in-
volved.  A  rule  must  be  promulgated  pursuant  to  authority  Congress 
has delegated to the official.  The specific respects in which the Attor-
ney General is authorized to make rules under the CSA show that he is 
not authorized to make a rule declaring illegitimate a medical standard 
for  patient  care  and  treatment  specifically  authorized  under  state  law. 
Congress  delegated to the Attorney  General  only the authority to pro-
mulgate rules relating to "registration" and "control" of the dispensing 
of  controlled  substances,  21  U. S. C.  $ 821  (2000  ed.,  Supp.  V),  and  "for 
the  efficient  execution  of  his  [statutory]  functions,"  21  U. S. C.  $ 871(b). 
Control  means  "to  add a . .  .  substance . . . to a  schedule,"  $ 802(5), 
following specified procedures.  Because the Interpretive Rule does not 
concern scheduling of substances and was not issued under the required 
procedures, it cannot fall under the Attorney General's control authority. 
Even  if  "control"  were  understood  to  signify  something  other  than  its 
statutory  definition,  it  could  not  support  the  Interpretive  Rule.  Nor 
can the Interpretive Rule be justified under the CSA's registration pro-
visions.  It does  not undertake the  Act's five-factor analysis  for deter-
mining  when  registration  is  "inconsistent  with  the  public  interest," 

$ 823(f), and it deals with much more than registration.  It purports to 
declare that using controlled substances for physician-assisted suicide is 
a  crime,  an  authority  going  well  beyond  the  Attorney  General's  statu-
tory power to register or deregister physicians.  It would be anomalous 
for  Congress  to  have  painstakingly  described  the  Attorney  General's 
limited  authority  to  deregister  a  single  physician  or  schedule  a  single 
drug, but to have given him, just by implication, authority to declare an 
entire  class  of  activity  outside  the  course  of  professional  practice  and 
therefore a criminal violation of the CSA.  It is not enough that "public 
interest," "public health and safety," and "Federal law" are used in the 
part  of  the  Act  over  which  the  Attorney  General  has  authority. 
Cf. Sutton v.  United Air Lines, Inc., 527 U. S. 471.  The first two terms 
do not call on the Attorney General, or any executive official, to make an 
independent  assessment  of  the  meaning  of  federal  law.  The  Attorney 
General  did  not  base  the  Interpretive  Rule  on  an  application  of  the 
five-factor  test  generally,  or  the  "public  health  and  safety"  factor  spe-
cifically.  Even  if  he  had,  it  is  doubtful  that  he could  cite those  factors

Syllabus 
to  deregister  a  physician  simply  because  he  deemed  a  controversial 
practice permitted by state law to have an illegitimate medical purpose. 
The federal-law  factor requires the Attorney General to decide  "[c]om-
pliance" with the law but does not suggest that he may decide what the 
law is.  To say that he can define the substantive standards of medical 
practice  as  part  of  his  authority  would  also  put  21  U. S. C.  $ 871(b)  in 
considerable tension with the narrowly defined control and registration 
delegation.  It  would  go,  moreover,  against  the  plain  language  of  the 
text to treat a delegation for the "execution" of his functions as a further 
delegation to define other functions well beyond the Act's specific grants 
of authority.  The authority desired by the Government is inconsistent 
with the Act's design in other fundamental respects, e. g., the Attorney 
General must share power with, and in some respect defer to, the Secre-
tary,  whose  functions  are  likewise  delineated  and  confined  by  the  Act. 
Postenactment  congressional  commentary  on  the  CSA's  regulation  of 
medical  practice  is  also  at  odds  with  the  Attorney  General's  claimed 
authority.  The  Government's  claim  that  the  Attorney  General's  deci-
sion  is  a  legal,  not  medical,  one  does  not  suffice,  for  the  Interpretive 
Rule  places  extensive  reliance  on  medical  judgments  and  views  of  the 
medical community in concluding that assisted suicide is not a legitimate 
medical purpose.  The idea that Congress gave him such broad and un-
usual  authority  through  an  implicit  delegation  is  not  sustainable.  The 
importance  of the issue  of  physician-assisted suicide  makes the  oblique 
form of the claimed delegation all the more suspect.  Pp. 258-269. 

(d)  The Attorney General's opinion  is unpersuasive under  Skidmore. 
The  CSA  and  this  Court's  case  law  amply  support  the  conclusion  that 
Congress  regulates  medical  practice  insofar  as  it  bars  doctors  from 
using  their  prescription-writing  powers  as  a  means  to  engage  in  illicit 
drug  dealing  and  trafficking  as  conventionally  understood.  Beyond 
this,  the  Act  manifests  no  intent  to  regulate  the  practice  of  medicine 
generally, which is understandable given federalism's structure and limi-
tations.  The  CSA's  structure  and  operation  presume  and  rely  upon  a 
functioning  medical  profession  regulated  under  the  States'  police  pow-
ers.  The Federal Government can set uniform standards for regulating 
health and safety.  In connection with the CSA, however, the only pro-
vision  in  which  Congress  set  general,  uniform  medical  practice  stand-
ards, 42 U. S. C. $ 290bb-2a, strengthens the understanding of the CSA 
as a  statute combating recreational drug abuse, and  also indicates that 
when Congress wants to regulate medical practice in the given scheme, 
it  does  so  by  explicit  statutory  language.  The  difficulty  in  defending 
the Attorney General's declaration that the CSA impliedly criminalizes 
physician-assisted suicide is compounded by the Act's consistent delega-

allocation  of  powers  for  enforcing  the  CSA's  limited  objectives.  The 
Government's  contention  that  the  terms  "medical"  or  "medicine"  refer 
to  a  healing  or  curative  art,  and  thus  cannot  embrace  the  intentional 
hastening of a patient's death, rests on a reading of 21 U. S. C. $ 829(a)'s 
prescription requirement without the illumination of the rest of the stat-
ute.  Viewed  in  context,  that  requirement  is  better  understood  as  en-
suring  that  patients  use  controlled  substances  under  a  doctor's  super-
vision  so  as  to  prevent  addiction  and  recreational  abuse.  To  read 
prescriptions for assisted suicide as "drug abuse" under the CSA is dis-
cordant with the phrase's consistent use throughout the Act, not to men-
tion its ordinary meaning.  The Government's interpretation of the pre-
scription  requirement  also  fails  under  the  objection  that  the  Attorney 
General is an unlikely recipient of such broad authority, given the Secre-
tary's  primacy  in  shaping  medical  policy  under  the  CSA  and  the  Act's 
otherwise  careful  allocation  of  decisionmaking  powers.  Pp.  269-275.

Opinion of the Court 
prohibit doctors from prescribing regulated drugs for use in 
physician-assisted  suicide,  notwithstanding  a  state  law  per-
mitting the procedure.  As the Court has observed, "Ameri-
cans  are  engaged  in  an  earnest  and  profound  debate  about 
the  morality,  legality,  and  practicality  of  physician-assisted 
suicide."  Washington  v.  Glucksberg,  521  U. S.  702,  735 
(1997).  The  dispute  before  us  is  in  part  a  product  of  this 
political  and  moral  debate,  but  its  resolution  requires  an  in-
quiry  familiar  to  the  courts:  interpreting  a  federal  statute 
to  determine  whether  executive  action  is  authorized  by,  or 
otherwise consistent with, the enactment. 

In 1994, Oregon became the first State to legalize assisted 
suicide when voters  approved a ballot  measure enacting the 
Oregon Death With Dignity Act (ODWDA).  Ore. Rev. Stat. 

$ 127.800  et  seq.  (2003).  ODWDA,  which  survived  a  1997 
ballot  measure  seeking  its  repeal,  exempts  from  civil  or 
criminal liability state-licensed physicians who, in compliance 
with  the  specific  safeguards  in  ODWDA,  dispense  or  pre-
scribe a lethal dose of drugs upon the request of a terminally 
ill patient. 

The drugs Oregon physicians prescribe under ODWDA are 
regulated under a federal statute, the Controlled Substances 
Act  (CSA  or  Act).  84  Stat.  1242,  as  amended,  21  U. S. C. 

$ 801  et  seq.  The  CSA  allows  these  particular  drugs  to  be 
available  only  by  a  written  prescription  from  a  registered 
physician.  In  the  ordinary  course  the  same  drugs  are  pre-
scribed in smaller doses for pain alleviation. 

A  November  9,  2001,  Interpretive  Rule  issued  by  the  At-
torney  General  addresses  the  implementation  and  enforce-
ment  of  the  CSA  with  respect  to  ODWDA.  It  determines 
that  using  controlled  substances  to  assist  suicide  is  not  a 

legitimate  medical  practice  and  that  dispensing  or  prescrib-
ing  them  for  this  purpose  is  unlawful  under  the  CSA.  The 
Interpretive  Rule's  validity  under  the  CSA  is  the  issue 
before us.

Opinion of the Court 

I 
A 

We  turn  first  to  the  text  and  structure  of  the  CSA. 
Enacted in 1970 with the main objectives of combating drug 
abuse  and  controlling  the  legitimate  and  illegitimate  traffic 
in  controlled  substances,  the  CSA  creates  a  comprehensive, 
closed  regulatory  regime  criminalizing  the  unauthorized 
manufacture, distribution, dispensing, and possession of sub-
stances classified in any of the Act's five schedules.  Gonza-
les v.  Raich,  545  U. S. 1,  12-13  (2005);  21 U. S. C. $ 841  (2000 
ed.  and  Supp.  II);  21  U. S. C.  $ 844.  The  Act  places  sub-
stances  in  one  of  five  schedules  based  on  their  potential  for 
abuse  or  dependence,  their  accepted  medical  use,  and  their 
accepted  safety  for  use  under  medical  supervision.  Sched-
ule I contains the most severe restrictions on access and use, 
and  Schedule  V  the  least.  Raich,  supra,  at  14;  21  U. S. C. 

$ 812.  Congress  classified  a  host  of  substances  when  it 
enacted the CSA, but the statute permits the Attorney Gen-
eral  to  add,  remove,  or  reschedule  substances.  He  may  do 
so,  however,  only  after  making  particular  findings,  and  on 
scientific  and  medical  matters  he  is  required  to  accept  the 
findings of the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Sec-
retary).  These  proceedings  must  be  on  the  record  after  an 
opportunity for comment.  See 21 U. S. C. $ 811 (2000 ed. and 
Supp. V). 

The  present  dispute  involves  controlled  substances  listed 
in Schedule II, substances generally available only pursuant 
to  a  written,  nonrefillable  prescription  by  a  physician.  21 
U. S. C. $ 829(a).  A 1971 regulation promulgated by the At-
torney  General  requires  that  every  prescription  for  a  con-
trolled substance "be issued for a legitimate medical purpose 
by an individual practitioner acting in the usual course of his 
professional practice."  21 CFR $ 1306.04(a) (2005). 

To prevent diversion of controlled substances with medical 
uses, the CSA regulates the activity of physicians.  To issue

Opinion of the Court 
lawful  prescriptions  of  Schedule  II  drugs,  physicians  must "obtain  from  the  Attorney  General  a  registration  issued  in 

accordance  with  the  rules  and  regulations  promulgated  by him."  21  U. S. C.  $ 822(a)(2).  The  Attorney  General  may 
deny, suspend, or revoke this registration if, as relevant here, the  physician's  registration  would  be  "inconsistent  with  the 
public  interest."  $ 824(a)(4); $ 822(a)(2).  When deciding whether a practitioner's registration is in the public interest, 
the Attorney General "shall" consider: 

"(1)  The  recommendation  of  the  appropriate  State  li-censing board or professional disciplinary authority. 

"(2)  The  applicant's  experience  in  dispensing,  or  con-ducting  research  with  respect  to  controlled  substances. 
"(3)  The  applicant's  conviction  record  under  Federal or  State  laws  relating  to  the  manufacture,  distribution, 
or dispensing of controlled substances. "(4)  Compliance  with  applicable  State,  Federal,  or 
local laws relating to controlled substances. "(5)  Such other conduct which may threaten the pub-
lic health and safety."  $ 823(f ). 
The  CSA  explicitly  contemplates  a  role  for  the  States  in regulating  controlled  substances,  as  evidenced  by  its  pre-

emption provision. 

"No provision of this subchapter shall be construed as indicating  an  intent  on  the  part  of  the  Congress  to  oc-

cupy the field in which that provision operates . . . to the exclusion  of  any  State  law  on  the  same  subject  matter 
which  would  otherwise  be  within  the  authority  of  the State,  unless  there  is  a  positive  conflict  between  that 
provision . . . and that State law so that the two cannot consistently stand together."  $ 903.

Oregon  voters  enacted  ODWDA  in  1994.  For  Oregon residents  to  be  eligible  to  request  a  prescription  under

Opinion of the Court 
ODWDA, they must receive a diagnosis from their attending physician  that  they  have  an  incurable  and  irreversible  dis-

ease  that,  within  reasonable  medical  judgment,  will  cause death  within  six  months.  Ore.  Rev.  Stat.  $$ 127.815, 
127.800(12)  (2003).  Attending  physicians  must  also  deter-mine whether a patient has made a voluntary request, ensure 
a  patient's  choice  is  informed,  and  refer  patients  to  counsel-ing  if  they  might  be  suffering  from  a  psychological  disorder 
or  depressi on  causing impaired judgment.  $$ 127.815, 127.825.  A second "consulting" physician must examine the 
patient  and  the  medical  record  and  confirm  the  attending physician's conclusions.  $ 127.800(8).  Oregon physicians 
may dispense or issue a prescription for the requested drug, but may not administer it.  $$ 127.815(1)(L), 127.880. 

The reviewing  physicians must keep detailed  medical rec-ords of the process leading to the final prescription, $ 127.855, 
records  that  Oregon's  Department  of  Human  Services  re-views,  $ 127.865.  Physicians  who  dispense  medication  pur-
suant  to  ODWDA  must  also  be  registered  with  both  the State's  Board  of  Medical  Examiners  and  the  federal  Drug 
Enforcement Administration (DEA).  $ 127.815(1)(L).  In 2004, 37 patients ended their lives by ingesting a lethal dose 
of  medication  prescribed  under  ODWDA.  Oregon  Dept.  of Human  Servs.,  Seventh  Annual  Report  on  Oregon's  Death 
with Dignity Act 20 (Mar. 10, 2005). 

C 
In  1997,  Members  of  Congress  concerned  about  ODWDA invited  the  DEA  to  prosecute  or  revoke  the  CSA  registra-

tion  of  Oregon  physicians  who  assist  suicide.  They  con-tended that hastening a patient's death is not legitimate med-
ical  practice,  so  prescribing  controlled  substances  for  that purpose  violates  the  CSA.  Letter  from  Sen.  Orrin  Hatch 
and  Rep.  Henry  Hyde  to  Thomas  A.  Constantine  (July  25, 1997),  reprinted  in  Hearing  on  S. 2151  before  the  Senate

(hereinafter Hearing).  The letter received an initial, favor-able response from the director of the DEA, see Letter from 

Thomas  A.  Constantine  to  Sen.  Orrin  Hatch  (Nov.  5,  1997), Hearing  4-5,  but  Attorney  General  Reno  considered  the 
matter  and  concluded  that  the  DEA  could  not  take  the  pro-posed  action  because  the  CSA  did  not  authorize  it  to  "dis-
place  the  states  as  the  primary  regulators  of  the  medical 
profession, or to override a state's determination as to what constitutes  legitimate  medical  practice,"  Letter  from  Attor-

ney  General  Janet  Reno  to  Sen.  Orrin  Hatch,  on  Oregon's Death with Dignity Act (June 5, 1998), Hearing 5-6.  Legis-
lation  was  then  introduced  to  grant  the  explicit  authority Attorney  General  Reno  found  lacking;  but  it  failed  to  pass. 
See H. R. 4006, 105th Cong., 2d Sess. (1998); H. R. 2260, 106th Cong., 1st Sess. (1999). 

In  2001,  John  Ashcroft  was  appointed  Attorney  General. Perhaps  because  Mr.  Ashcroft  had  supported  efforts  to  cur-
tail assisted suicide while serving as a Senator, see, e. g., 143 Cong. Rec. 5589-5590 (1997) (remarks of Sen. Ashcroft), Ore-
gon  Attorney  General  Hardy  Myers  wrote  him  to  request  a 
meeting  with  Department  of  Justice  officials  should  the  De-partment  decide  to  revisit  the  application  of  the  CSA  to  as-

sisted  suicide.  Letter  of  Feb.  2,  2001,  App.  to  Brief  for Patient-Respondents  in  Opposition  55a.  Attorney  General 
Myers  received  a  reply  letter  from  one  of  Attorney  General Ashcroft's advisers writing on his behalf, which stated: 

"I am aware of no pending legislation in Congress that would  prompt  a  review of  the  Department's  interpreta-
tion  of  the  CSA  as  it  relates  to  physician-assisted  sui-
cide.  Should such a review be commenced in the future, 
we  would  be  happy  to  include  your  views  in  that  re-
view."  Letter  from  Lori  Sharpe  (Apr.  17,  2001),  id.,

ently  anyone  outside  his  Department,  the  Attorney  General

254  GONZALES  v.  OREGON 

Opinion of the Court 
issued an Interpretive Rule announcing his intent to restrict the  use  of  controlled  substances  for  physician-assisted  sui-

cide.  Incorporating  the legal analysis of a memorandum he had  solicited  from  his  Office  of  Legal  Counsel,  the  Attorney 
General ruled: 

"[A]ssisting suicide is not a `legitimate medical purpose' 
within  the  meaning  of  21  CFR  1306.04  (2001),  and  that prescribing,  dispensing,  or  administering  federally  con-

trolled  substances  to  assist  suicide  violates  the  Con-trolled  Substances  Act.  Such  conduct  by  a  physician 
registered  to  dispense  controlled  substances  may  `ren-der  his  registration  .  .  .  inconsistent  with  the  public  in-
terest'  and  therefore  subject  to  possible  suspension  or 
revocation  under  21  U. S. C.  824(a)(4).  The  Attorney General's conclusion applies regardless of whether state 

law authorizes or permits such conduct by practitioners or  others  and  regardless  of  the  condition  of  the  person 
whose  suicide  is  assisted."  66  Fed.  Reg.  56608  (2001). 
There  is  little  dispute  that  the  Interpretive  Rule  would substantially  disrupt  the  ODWDA  regime.  Respondents 

contend, and petitioners do not dispute, that every prescrip-
tion filled under ODWDA has specified drugs classified under Schedule  II.  A  physician  cannot  prescribe  the  substances 

without  DEA  registration,  and  revocation  or  suspension  of the  registration  would  be  a  severe  restriction  on  medical 
practice.  Dispensing  controlled  substances  without  a  valid prescription,  furthermore,  is  a  federal  crime.  See, 

e. g.,  21 
U. S. C.  $ 841(a)(1);  United  States  v.  Moore,  423  U. S.  122 (1975). 

In  response  the  State  of  Oregon,  joined  by  a  physician,  a 
pharmacist,  and  some  terminally  ill  patients,  all  from  Ore-
gon, challenged the Interpretive Rule in federal court.  The 
United  States  District  Court  for  the  District  of  Oregon 
entered  a  permanent  injunction  against  the  Interpretive 
Rule's enforcement.

Opinion of the Court 
A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Cir-cuit  granted  the  petitions  for  review  and  held  the  Interpre-

tive Rule invalid.  Oregon v.  Ashcroft, 368 F. 3d 1118 (2004). It reasoned that,  by making  a  medical procedure authorized 
under  Oregon  law  a  federal  offense,  the  Interpretive  Rule altered  the  " ` "usual  constitutional  balance  between  the 
States and the Federal Government" ' " without the requisite clear  statement  that  the  CSA  authorized  such  action. 

Id., at 1124-1125 (quoting Gregory v.  Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452, 460 

(1991), in turn quoting Atascadero State Hospital v.  Scanlon, 473 U. S. 234, 242 (1985)).  The Court of Appeals held in the 
alternative  that  the  Interpretive  Rule  could  not  be  squared with the plain language of the CSA, which targets only con-
ventional  drug  abuse  and  excludes  the  Attorney  General from  decisions  on  medical  policy.  368  F.  3d,  at  1125-1129. 

We granted the Government's petition for certiorari.  543 U. S. 1145 (2005). 

II 
Executive  actors  often  must  interpret  the  enactments Congress  has  charged  them  with  enforcing  and  implement-

ing.  The  parties  before  us  are  in  sharp  disagreement  both as  to  the  degree  of  deference  we  must  accord  the  Interpre-
tive  Rule's  substantive  conclusions  and  whether  the  Rule  is authorized by the statutory text at all.  Although balancing 
the  necessary  respect  for  an  agency's  knowledge,  expertise, and  constitutional  office  with  the  courts'  role  as  interpreter 
of laws can be a delicate matter, familiar principles guide us. An  administrative  rule  may  receive  substantial  deference  if 
it interprets the issuing agency's own ambiguous regulation. Auer v.  Robbins, 519 U. S. 452, 461-463 (1997).  An interpre-
tation  of  an  ambiguous  statute  may  also  receive  substantial deference.  Chevron  U. S. A. Inc.  v.  Natural Resources De-
fense  Council,  Inc.,  467  U. S.  837,  842-845  (1984).  Defer-ence in accordance with Chevron, however, is warranted only 
"when  it  appears  that  Congress  delegated  authority  to  the agency  generally  to  make  rules  carrying  the  force  of  law,

Opinion of the Court 
and  that  the  agency  interpretation  claiming  deference  was promulgated  in  the  exercise  of  that  authority."  United 

States  v.  Mead  Corp.,  533  U. S.  218,  226-227  (2001).  Other-wise,  the  interpretation  is  "entitled  to  respect"  only  to  the 
extent it has the "power to persuade."  Skidmore v.  Swift & Co.,  323 U. S. 134, 140 (1944). 

A 
The Government first argues that the Interpretive Rule is an  elaboration  of  one  of  the  Attorney  General's  own  reg-

ulations,  21  CFR  $ 1306.04  (2005),  which  requires  all  pre-scriptions  be issued  "for a  legitimate medical purpose  by  an 
individual  practitioner  acting  in  the  usual  course  of  his professional  practice."  As  such,  the  Government  says,  the 
Interpretive Rule is entitled to considerable deference in ac-cordance with 

Auer. In our view Auer and the standard of deference it accords 

to  an  agency  are  inapplicable  here.  Auer  involved  a  dis-puted interpretation of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 
as applied to a class of law enforcement officers.  Under reg-ulations  promulgated  by  the  Secretary  of  Labor,  an  exemp-
tion  from  overtime  pay  depended,  in  part,  on  whether  the employees  met  the  "salary  basis"  test.  519  U. S.,  at  454- 
455.  In  this  Court  the  Secretary  of  Labor  filed  an  amicus brief  explaining  why,  in  his  view,  the  regulations  gave  ex-
empt status to the officers.  Id., at 461.  We gave weight to that  interpretation,  holding  that  because  the  applicable  test 
was  "a  creature  of  the  Secretary's  own  regulations,  his  in-terpretation of it is, under our jurisprudence, controlling un-
less  plainly  erroneous  or  inconsistent  with  the  regulation." 
Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). In  Auer,  the  underlying  regulations  gave  specificity  to  a 

statutory  scheme  the  Secretary  of  Labor  was  charged  with enforcing  and  reflected  the  considerable  experience  and  ex-
pertise  the  Department  of  Labor  had  acquired  over  time with respect to the complexities of the Fair Labor Standards

Opinion of the Court 
Act.  Here,  on  the  other  hand,  the  underlying  regulation does  little  more  than  restate  the  terms  of  the  statute  itself. 

The  language  the  Interpretive  Rule  addresses  comes  from Congress,  not  the  Attorney  General,  and  the  near  equiva-
lence  of  the  statute  and  regulation  belies  the  Government's argument for 

Auer deference. 
The  Government  does  not  suggest  that  its  interpretation 
turns  on  any  difference  between  the  statutory  and  regula-tory  language.  The  CSA  allows  prescription  of  drugs  only 

if  they  have  a  "currently  accepted  medical  use,"  21  U. S. C. $ 812(b);  requires  a  "medical  purpose"  for  dispensing  the 
least controlled substances of those on the schedules, $ 829(c); 
and,  in  its  reporting  provision,  defines  a  "valid  prescrip-
tion"  as  one  "issued  for  a  legitimate  medical  purpose," 

$ 830(b)(3)(A)(ii).  Similarly, physicians  are  considered to be 
acting  as  practitioners  under  the  statute  if  they  dispense 
controlled substances "in the course of professional practice." 

$ 802(21).  The  regulation  uses  the  terms  "legitimate  medi-
cal purpose" and "the course  of professional practice," ibid., 
but  this  just  repeats  two  statutory  phrases  and  attempts  to 
summarize the  others.  It gives little  or no instruction on a 
central  issue  in  this  case:  Who  decides  whether  a  particular 
activity is in "the course of professional practice" or done for 
a "legitimate medical purpose"?  Since the regulation gives 
no indication how to decide this issue, the Attorney General's 
effort to decide it now cannot be considered an interpretation 
of  the  regulation.  Simply  put,  the  existence  of  a  parroting 
regulation does not change the fact that the question here is 
not  the  meaning  of  the  regulation  but  the  meaning  of  the 
statute.  An agency does not acquire special authority to in-
terpret  its  own  words  when,  instead  of  using  its  expertise 
and  experience  to  formulate  a  regulation,  it  has  elected 
merely to paraphrase the statutory language. 

Furthermore,  as  explained below, if there  is statutory au-
thority to issue the Interpretive Rule it comes from the 1984 
amendments to the CSA that gave the Attorney General au-

258  GONZALES  v.  OREGON 

Opinion of the Court 
thority  to  register  and  deregister  physicians  based  on  the public  interest.  The  regulation  was  enacted  before  those 

amendments, so the Interpretive Rule cannot be justified as indicative  of  some  intent  the  Attorney  General  had  in  1971. 
That  the  current  interpretation  runs  counter  to  the  "intent at the time of the regulation's promulgation" is an additional 
reason  why  Auer  deference  is  unwarranted.  Thomas  Jef-
ferson  Univ.  v.  Shalala,  512  U. S.  504,  512  (1994)  (internal quotation  marks omitted).  Deference  under Auer  being  in-

appropriate,  we  turn  to  the  question  whether  the  Interpre-tive  Rule,  on  its  own  terms,  is  a  permissible  interpretation 
of the CSA.  B 

Just as the Interpretive Rule receives no deference under Auer,  neither  does  it  receive  deference  under  Chevron.  If 
a  statute  is  ambiguous,  judicial  review  of  administrative rulemaking  often  demands  Chevron  deference;  and  the  rule 
is  judged  accordingly.  All  would  agree,  we  should  think, that  the  statutory  phrase  "legitimate  medical  purpose"  is  a 
generality, susceptible to more precise definition and open to varying  constructions,  and  thus  ambiguous  in  the  relevant 
sense.  Chevron deference, however, is not accorded merely because the statute is ambiguous  and an administrative offi-
cial  is  involved.  To  begin  with,  the  rule  must  be  promul-gated  pursuant  to  authority  Congress  has  delegated  to  the 
official.  Mead, supra, at 226-227. The  Attorney  General  has  rulemaking  power  to  fulfill  his 
duties  under  the  CSA.  The  specific respects  in  which  he  is authorized to make rules, however, instruct us that he is not 
authorized  to  make  a  rule  declaring  illegitimate  a  medical standard  for  care  and  treatment  of  patients  that  is  specifi-
cally authorized under state law. The  starting  point  for  this  inquiry  is,  of  course,  the  lan-
guage  of  the  delegation  provision  itself.  In  many  cases  au-thority  is  clear  because  the  statute  gives  an  agency  broad 
power to enforce all provisions of the statute.  See, e. g., Na-

ulations . . . as,  in  the  judgment  of  the  Board,  `are  neces-
sary  or  proper  to  effectuate  the  purposes  of ' "  the  statute 
(quoting 15 U. S. C. $ 1604(a))).  The CSA does not grant the 
Attorney  General  this  broad  authority  to  promulgate  rules. 

The  CSA  gives  the  Attorney  General  limited  powers,  to 
be  exercised  in  specific  ways.  His  rulemaking  authority 
under  the  CSA  is  described  in  two  provisions:  (1)  "The  At-
torney  General  is  authorized  to  promulgate  rules  and  regu-
lations  and  to  charge  reasonable  fees  relating  to  the  regis-
tration  and  control  of  the  manufacture,  distribution,  and 
dispensing of controlled substances and to listed chemicals," 
21  U. S.  C.  $ 821  (2000  ed.,  Supp.  V);  and  (2)  "The  Attorney 
General may promulgate and enforce any rules, regulations, 
and  procedures  which  he  may  deem  necessary  and  appro-
priate  for  the  efficient  execution  of  his  functions  under  this 
subchapter,"  21  U. S. C.  $ 871(b).  As  is  evident  from  these 
sections, Congress did not delegate to the Attorney General 
authority  to  carry  out  or  effect  all  provisions  of  the  CSA. 
Rather,  he  can  promulgate  rules  relating  only  to  "registra-
tion"  and  "control,"  and  "for  the  efficient  execution  of  his 
functions" under the statute. 

Turning first to the Attorney General's authority to make 
regulations for the "control" of drugs, this delegation cannot 
sustain  the  Interpretive  Rule's  attempt  to  define  standards 
of  medical  practice.  Control  is  a  term  of  art  in  the  CSA.

Opinion of the Court 
"As  used  in  this  subchapter,"  $ 802--the  subchapter  that in-cludes $ 821-- 

"The  term  `control'  means  to  add  a  drug  or  other  sub-stance, or immediate precursor, to a schedule under part 
B  of  this  subchapter,  whether  by  transfer  from  another schedule or otherwise."  $ 802(5). 

To exercise his scheduling power, the Attorney General must 
follow  a  detailed  set  of  procedures,  including  requesting  a 
scientific and medical evaluation from the Secretary.  See 21 U. S. C.  $$ 811,  812  (2000  ed.  and  Supp.  V).  The  statute  is 

also specific as to the manner in which the Attorney General must  exercise  this  authority:  "Rules  of  the  Attorney  Gen-
eral  under  this  subsection  [regarding  scheduling]  shall  be made  on  the  record  after  opportunity  for  a  hearing  pur-
suant  to  the  rulemaking  procedures  prescribed  by  [the  Ad-ministrative  Procedure  Act,  5  U. S. C.  $ 553]."  21  U. S. C. 

$ 811(a).  The  Interpretive  Rule  now  under  consideration does  not  concern  the  scheduling  of  substances  and  was  not 
issued  after  the  required  procedures  for  rules  regarding 
scheduling,  so  it  cannot  fall  under  the  Attorney  General's 
"control" authority. 

Even if "control" in $ 821 were understood to signify some-
thing other than its statutory definition, it would not support 
the  Interpretive  Rule.  The  statutory  references  to  "con-
trol" outside  the  scheduling context  make clear  that  the At-
torney  General  can  establish  controls  "against  diversion," 
e. g., $ 823(a)(1), but do not give him authority to define diver-
sion  based  on  his  view  of  legitimate  medical  practice.  As 
explained below, the CSA's express limitations on the Attor-
ney General's authority, and other indications from the statu-
tory scheme, belie any notion that the Attorney General has 
been  granted  this  implicit  authority.  Indeed,  if  "control" 
were  given  the  expansive  meaning  required  to  sustain  the 
Interpretive Rule, it would transform the carefully described

Opinion of the Court 
limits  on the  Attorney General's  authority  over  registration 
and scheduling into mere suggestions. 

We  turn,  next,  to  the  registration  provisions  of  the  CSA. 
Before  1984,  the  Attorney  General  was  required  to  register 
any physician who was authorized by his State.  The Attor-
ney  General  could  only  deregister  a  physician  who  falsified 
his  application,  was  convicted  of  a  felony  relating  to  con-
trolled  substances,  or  had  his  state  license  or  registration 
revoked.  See  84  Stat.  1255.  The  CSA  was  amended  in 
1984  to  allow  the  Attorney  General  to  deny  registration  to 
an applicant "if he determines that the issuance of such reg-
istration would be inconsistent with the public interest."  21 
U. S. C.  $ 823(f ).  Registration  may  also  be  revoked  or  sus-
pended  by  the  Attorney  General  on  the  same  grounds. 

$ 824(a)(4).  In  determining  consistency  with  the  public  in-
terest,  the  Attorney  General  must,  as  discussed  above,  con-
sider  five  factors,  including:  the  State's  recommendation; 
compliance with state, federal, and local laws regarding con-
trolled substances; and public health and safety.  $ 823(f). 

The  Interpretive  Rule  cannot  be  justified  under  this  part 
of the statute.  It does not undertake the five-factor analysis 
and  concerns  much  more  than  registration.  Nor  does  the 
Interpretive  Rule  on  its  face  purport  to  be  an  application 
of  the  registration  provision  in  $ 823(f ).  It  is,  instead,  an 
interpretation  of  the  substantive  federal  law  requirements 
(under  21 CFR $ 1306.04 (2005)) for a  valid prescription.  It 
begins  by  announcing  that  assisting  suicide  is  not  a  "legiti-
mate  medical  purpose"  under  $ 1306.04,  and  that  dispensing 
controlled  substances  to  assist  a  suicide  violates  the  CSA. 
66  Fed.  Reg.  56608.  Violation  is  a  criminal  offense,  and 
often a felony, under 21 U. S. C. $ 841 (2000 ed. and Supp. II). 
The  Interpretive  Rule  thus  purports  to  declare  that  using 
controlled  substances  for  physician-assisted  suicide  is  a 
crime, an authority that goes well beyond the Attorney Gen-
eral's statutory power to register or deregister.

262  GONZALES  v.  OREGON 

Opinion of the Court 
The  Attorney  General's  deregistration  power,  of  course, may carry implications for criminal enforcement because if a 

physician dispenses a controlled substance after he is dereg-istered,  he  violates  $ 841.  The  Interpretive  Rule  works  in 
the  opposite  direction,  however:  It  declares  certain  conduct criminal,  placing  in  jeopardy  the  registration  of  any  physi-
cian who engages in  that conduct.  To the extent the  Inter-
pretive Rule concerns registration, it simply states the obvi-ous  because  one  of  the  five  factors  the  Attorney  General 

must  consider  in  deciding  the  "public  interest"  is  "[c]ompli-ance with applicable State, Federal, or local laws relating to 
controlled  substances."  21  U. S. C.  $ 823(f)(4).  The  prob-
lem with the design of the Interpretive Rule is that it cannot, 
and does not,  explain why  the  Attorney General has  the au-
thority to decide what constitutes an underlying violation of 
the CSA in the first place.  The explanation the Government 
seems to advance is that the Attorney General's authority to 
decide  whether  a  physician's  actions  are  inconsistent  with 
the  "public  interest"  provides  the  basis  for  the  Interpretive 
Rule. 

By  this  logic,  however,  the  Attorney  General  claims  ex-
traordinary  authority.  If  the  Attorney  General's  argument 
were  correct,  his  power  to  deregister  necessarily  would  in-
clude  the  greater  power  to  criminalize  even  the  actions  of 
registered  physicians,  whenever  they  engage  in  conduct  he 
deems  illegitimate.  This  power  to  criminalize--unlike  his 
power over registration, which must be exercised only after 
considering  five  express  statutory  factors--would  be  unre-
strained.  It  would  be  anomalous  for  Congress  to  have  so 
painstakingly  described  the  Attorney  General's  limited  au-
thority  to  deregister  a  single  physician  or  schedule  a  single 
drug,  but  to  have  given  him,  just  by  implication,  authority 
to  declare  an  entire  class  of  activity  outside  "the  course  of 
professional  practice,"  and  therefore  a  criminal  violation  of 
the CSA.  See Federal Maritime Comm'n v.  Seatrain Lines, 
Inc.,  411  U. S.  726,  744  (1973)  ("In  light  of  these  specific

further  authority]--a  purpose  for  which  it  obviously  was not intended"). 

Sutton  v.  United  Air  Lines,  Inc.,  527  U. S.  471  (1999),  is instructive.  The  statute  at  issue  was  the  Americans  with 
Disabilities  Act of  1990 (ADA),  which, like  the CSA, divides 
interpretive authority among various executive actors.  The Court  relied  on  "the  terms  and  structure  of  the  ADA"  to 

decide  that  neither  the  Equal  Employment  Opportunity Commission (EEOC), nor any other agency, had authority to 
define "disability" in the ADA.  Id., at 479.  Specifically, the 
delegating  provision  stated  that  the  EEOC  "shall  issue 
regulations  .  .  .  to  carry  out  this  subchapter,"  42  U. S. C. 

$ 12116,  and  the  section  of  the  statute  defining  "disability" 
was in a different subchapter.  The Court did not accept the 
idea  that  because  "the  employment  subchapter,  i. e.,  `this 
subchapter,'  includes  other  provisions  that  use  the  defined 
terms, . . . [t]he EEOC might elaborate, through regulations, 
on  the  meaning  of  `disability' . . . if  elaboration  is  needed  in 
order  to  `carry  out'  the  substantive  provisions  of  `this  sub-
chapter.' "  527  U. S.,  at  514  (Breyer,

application  of  the  five-factor  test  generally,  or  the  "public health  and  safety"  factor  specifically.  Even  if  he  had,  it  is 

doubtful  the  Attorney  General  could  cite  the  "public  inter-est"  or  "public  health"  to  deregister  a  physician  simply  be-
cause he deemed a controversial practice permitted by state law to have an illegitimate medical purpose. 

As  for  the  federal-law  factor,  though  it  does  require  the 
Attorney  General  to  decide  "[c]ompliance"  with  the  law,  it does  not  suggest  that  he  may  decide  what  the  law  says. 

Were  it  otherwise,  the  Attorney  General  could  authorita-tively  interpret  "State"  and  "local  laws,"  which  are  also  in-
cluded  in  21  U. S. C.  $ 823(f),  despite  the  obvious  constitu-
tional  problems  in  his  doing  so.  Just  as  he  must  evaluate 
compliance  with  federal  law  in  deciding  about  registration, 
the  Attorney  General  must  as  surely  evaluate  compliance 
with  federal  law  in  deciding  whether  to  prosecute;  but  this 
does not entitle him to Chevron deference.  See Crandon v. 
United  States,  494  U. S.  152,  177  (1990)  (Scalia,

the  statute's  specific  grants  of  authority.  When  Congress chooses to delegate  a power  of this  extent, it does  so not  by 

referring back to the administrator's functions but by giving authority over the provisions of the statute he is to interpret. 
See, e. g., National Cable & Telecommunications Assn., 545 U. S. 967; 

Household Credit Services, 541 U. S. 232. 
The  authority  desired  by  the  Government  is  inconsistent 
with the design of the statute in other fundamental respects. The  Attorney  General  does  not  have  the  sole  delegated  au-

thority under the CSA.  He must instead share it with, and in some respects defer to, the Secretary, whose functions are 
likewise  delineated  and  confined  by  the  statute.  The  CSA 
allocates  decisionmaking  powers  among  statutory  actors  so 
that medical judgments, if they are to be decided at the fed-
eral  level  and  for  the  limited  objects  of  the  statute,  are 
placed in the hands of the Secretary.  In the scheduling con-
text, for example, the Secretary's recommendations on scien-
tific  and  medical  matters  bind  the  Attorney  General.  The 
Attorney General cannot control a substance if the Secretary 
disagrees.  21 U. S. C. $ 811(b).  See H. R. Rep. No. 91-1444, 
pt.  1,  p.  33  (1970)  (the  section  "is  not  intended  to  authorize 
the  Attorney  General  to  undertake  or  support  medical  and 
scientific  research  [for  the  purpose  of  scheduling],  which  is 
within  the  competence of the  Department of Health, Educa-
tion, and Welfare"). 

In a similar vein the 1970 Act's regulation of medical prac-
tice  with  respect  to  drug  rehabilitation  gives  the  Attorney 
General a limited role; for it is the Secretary who, after con-
sultation  with  the  Attorney  General  and  national  medical 
groups,  "determine[s]  the  appropriate  methods  of  profes-
sional practice in the medical treatment of . . . narcotic addic-
tion."  42  U. S. C.  $ 290bb-2a;  see  21  U. S. C.  $ 823(g)  (2000 
ed.  and  Supp.  II)  (stating  that  the  Attorney  General  shall

cluded the applicant will comply with recordkeeping and se-curity  regulations); 

Moore,  423  U. S.,  at  144  (noting  that 
in  enacting  the  addiction-treatment  provisions,  Congress sought to change the fact "that `criminal prosecutions' in the 

past  had  turned  on  the  opinions  of  federal  prosecutors"); H. R.  Rep.  No.  93-884,  p.  6  (1974)  ("This  section  preserves 
the distinctions found in the [CSA] between the functions of 
the Attorney General and the Secretary . . . .   All  decisions of  a  medical  nature  are  to  be  made  by  the  Secretary  . . . .  

Law enforcement decisions respecting the security of stocks of  narcotic  drugs  and  the  maintenance  of  records  on  such 
drugs are to be made by the Attorney General"). 

Postenactment  congressional  commentary  on  the  CSA's 
regulation of medical practice is also at odds with the Attor-
ney  General's  claimed  authority  to  determine  appropriate 
medical  standards.  In  1978,  in  preparation  for  ratification 
of the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, Feb. 21, 1971, 
[1979-1980]  32  U.  S.  T.  543,  T.  I.  A.  S.  No.  9725,  Congress 
decided  it  would  implement  the  United  States'  compliance 
through  "the  framework  of  the  procedures  and  criteria  for 
classificati on of substances provided in the" CSA.  21 
U. S. C.  $ 801a(3).  It  did  so  to  ensure  that  "nothing  in  the 
Convention  will  interfere  with  ethical  medical  practice  in 
this country as determined by [the Secretary] on the basis of 
a consensus of the views of the American medical and scien-
tific community."  Ibid. 

The  structure  of  the  CSA,  then,  conveys  unwillingness  to 
cede  medical  judgments  to  an  executive  official  who  lacks 
medical  expertise.  In  interpreting  statutes  that  divide 
authority,  the  Court  has  recognized:  "Because  historical 
familiarity  and  policymaking  expertise  account  in  the  first 
instance  for  the  presumption  that  Congress  delegates  in-
terpretive  lawmaking  power  to  the  agency  rather  than  to 
the  reviewing  court,  we  presume  here  that  Congress  in-
tended  to  invest  interpretive  power  in  the  administrative 
actor in the best position to develop these attributes."  Mar-

Opinion of the Court 
tin v.  Occupational Safety and Health Review Comm'n, 499 U. S.  144,  153  (1991)  (citations  omitted).  This  presumption 

works  against  a  conclusion  that  the  Attorney  General  has authority to make quintessentially medical judgments. 

The Government contends the Attorney General's decision here is a legal, not a medical, one.  This generality, however, 
does not suffice.  The Attorney General's Interpretive Rule, 
and  the  Office  of  Legal  Counsel  memo  it  incorporates,  place extensive  reliance  on  medical  judgments  and  the  views  of 

the medical community in concluding that assisted suicide is not a "legitimate medical purpose."  See 66 Fed. Reg. 56608 
(noting  the  "medical"  distinctions  between  assisting  suicide 
and giving sufficient medication to alleviate pain); Memoran-
dum from Office of Legal Counsel to Attorney General (June 
27, 2001), App. to Pet. for Cert. 121a-122a, and n. 17 (discuss-
ing  the  "Federal  medical  policy"  against  physician-assisted 
suicide),  id.,  at  124a-130a  (examining  views  of  the  medical 
community).  This  confirms  that  the  authority  claimed  by 
the Attorney General is both beyond his expertise and incon-
gruous with the statutory purposes and design. 

The  idea  that  Congress  gave  the  Attorney  General  such 
broad  and  unusual  authority  through  an  implicit  delegation 
in the CSA's registration provision is not sustainable.  "Con-
gress,  we  have  held,  does  not  alter  the  fundamental  details 
of  a  regulatory  scheme  in  vague  terms  or  ancillary  provi-
sions--it  does  not,  one  might  say,  hide  elephants  in  mouse-
holes."  Whitman  v.  American  Trucking  Assns.,  Inc.,  531 
U. S.  457,  468  (2001);  see  FDA  v.  Brown  &  Williamson  To-
bacco  Corp.,  529  U. S.  120,  160  (2000)  ("[W]e  are  confident 
that Congress could not have intended to delegate a decision 
of such economic and political significance to an agency in so 
cryptic a fashion"). 

The  importance  of  the  issue  of  physician-assisted  suicide, 
which  has  been  the  subject  of  an  "earnest  and  profound  de-
bate" across the country, Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at 735, makes 
the  oblique form  of  the  claimed  delegation  all  the  more  sus-

Opinion of the Court 
pect.  Under  the  Government's  theory,  moreover,  the  med-ical  judgments  the  Attorney  General  could  make  are  not 

limited  to  physician-assisted  suicide.  Were  this  argument accepted,  he  could  decide  whether  any  particular  drug  may 
be used for any particular purpose, or indeed whether a phy-sician who administers any controversial treatment could be 
deregistered.  This  would  occur,  under  the  Government's 
view, despite the statute's express limitation of the Attorney General's  authority  to  registration and  control,  with  attend-

ant  restrictions  on  each  of  those  functions,  and  despite  the statutory  purposes  to  combat  drug  abuse  and  prevent  illicit 
drug trafficking. 

We  need  not  decide  whether  Chevron  deference  would  be 
warranted for an interpretation issued by the Attorney Gen-
eral  concerning  matters  closer  to  his  role  under  the  CSA, 
namely, preventing doctors from engaging in illicit drug traf-
ficking.  In  light  of  the  foregoing,  however,  the  CSA  does 
not  give  the  Attorney  General  authority  to  issue  the  Inter-
pretive Rule as a statement with the force of law. 

If,  in  the  course  of  exercising  his  authority,  the  Attorney 
General  uses  his  analysis  in  the  Interpretive  Rule  only  for 
guidance  in  deciding  when  to  prosecute  or  deregister,  then 
the question remains whether his substantive interpretation 
is  correct.  Since  the  Interpretive  Rule  was  not  promul-
gated pursuant to the Attorney General's authority, its inter-
pretation  of  "legitimate  medical  purpose"  does  not  receive 
Chevron  deference.  Instead,  it  receives  deference  only  in 
accordance with Skidmore.  "The weight of such a judgment 
in  a  particular  case  will  depend  upon  the  thoroughness  evi-
dent in its consideration, the validity of its reasoning, its con-
sistency with earlier and later pronouncements, and all those 
factors  which  give  it  power to persuade,  if lacking  power to 
control."  323  U. S.,  at  140; see  also  Mead,  533  U.  S.,  at  235 
(noting  that  an  opinion  receiving  Skidmore  deference  may

sources of weight").  The deference here is tempered by the Attorney General's lack of expertise in this area and the ap-

parent  absence  of  any  consultation  with  anyone  outside  the Department  of  Justice  who  might  aid  in  a  reasoned  judg-
ment.  In any event, under Skidmore, we follow an agency's rule  only  to  the  extent  it  is  persuasive,  see  Christensen  v. 
Harris County, 529 U. S. 576, 587 (2000); and for the reasons given  and  for  further  reasons  set  out  below,  we  do  not  find 
the Attorney General's opinion persuasive. 

III 
As  we  have  noted  before,  the  CSA  "repealed  most  of  the earlier  antidrug  laws  in  favor  of  a  comprehensive  regime 

to  combat  the  international  and  interstate  traffic  in  illicit drugs."  Raich,  545  U. S.,  at  12.  In  doing  so,  Congress 
sought to "conquer drug abuse  and to control the  legitimate and  illegitimate  traffic  in  controlled  substances."  Ibid.  It 
comes  as  little  surprise,  then,  that  we  have  not  considered the  extent  to  which  the  CSA  regulates  medical  practice  be-
yond  prohibiting  a  doctor  from  acting  as  a  drug  " `pusher' " instead of a physician.  Moore, 423 U. S., at 143.  In Moore, 
we  addressed  a  situation  in  which  a  doctor  "sold  drugs,  not for  legitimate  purposes,  but  primarily  for  the  profits  to 
be  derived  therefrom."  Id.,  at  135  (quoting  H.  R.  Rep. No.  91-1444,  pt.  1,  at  10;  internal  quotation  marks  omitted). 
There  the  defendant,  who  had  engaged  in  large-scale  over-prescribing  of  methadone,  "concede[d]  in  his  brief  that  he

United  States  v.  Oakland  Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative, 532 U. S. 483 (2001), Congress' express 

determination  that  marijuana  had  no  accepted  medical  use foreclosed  any  argument  about  statutory  coverage  of  drugs 
available by a doctor's prescription. In  deciding  whether  the  CSA  can  be  read  as  prohibiting 
physician-assisted  suicide,  we  look  to  the  statute's  text  and design.  The  statute  and  our  case  law  amply  support  the

Opinion of the Court 
conclusion  that  Congress  regulates  medical  practice  insofar 
as it bars doctors from using their prescription-writing pow-
ers as a  means  to engage in illicit  drug dealing  and traffick-
ing  as  conventionally  understood.  Beyond  this,  however, 
the  statute  manifests  no  intent  to  regulate  the  practice  of 
medicine generally.  The silence is understandable given the 
structure  and  limitations  of  federalism,  which  allow  the 
States " `great latitude under their police powers to legislate 
as  to  the  protection  of  the  lives,  limbs,  health,  comfort,  and 
quiet  of  all  persons.' "  Medtronic,  Inc.  v.  Lohr,  518  U. S. 
470, 475 (1996) (quoting Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v.  Massa-
chusetts, 471 U. S. 724, 756 (1985)). 

The structure and operation of the CSA presume and rely 
upon  a  functioning  medical  profession  regulated  under  the 
States' police powers.  The Attorney General can register a 
physician  to  dispense controlled  substances  "if the  applicant 
is authorized to dispense . . . controlled substances under the 
laws of the State in which he practices."  21 U. S. C. $ 823(f). 
When  considering  whether  to  revoke  a  physician's  regis-
tration,  the  Attorney  General  looks  not  just  to  violations  of 
federal  drug  laws;  but  he  "shall"  also  consider  "[t]he  recom-
mendation  of  the  appropriate  State  licensing  board  or  pro-
fessional  disciplinary  authority"  and  the  registrant's  com-
pliance  with  state  and  local  drug  laws.  Ibid.  The  very 
definition  of  a  "practitioner"  eligible  to  prescribe  includes 
physicians  "licensed,  registered,  or  otherwise  permitted,  by 
the  United  States  or  the  jurisdiction  in  which  he  practices" 
to  dispense  controlled  substances.  $ 802(21).  Further  cau-
tioning  against  the  conclusion  that  the  CSA  effectively  dis-
places  the  States'  general  regulation  of  medical  practice  is 
the Act's pre-emption provision, which indicates that, absent 
a  positive  conflict,  none  of  the  Act's  provisions  should  be 
"construed  as  indicating  an  intent  on  the  part  of  the  Con-
gress to occupy the field in which that provision operates . . .

ter  which  would  otherwise  be  within  the  authority  of  the State."  $ 903. 

Oregon's  regime  is  an  example  of  the  state  regulation  of medical  practice  that  the  CSA  presupposes.  Rather  than 
simply  decriminalizing  assisted  suicide,  ODWDA  limits  its exercise to the attending physicians of terminally ill patients, 
physicians who must be licensed by Oregon's Board of Medi-cal Examiners.  Ore.  Rev.  Stat. $$ 127.815, 127.800(10) 
(2003).  The  statute  gives  attending  physicians  a  central role, requiring them to provide prognoses and prescriptions, 
give  information  about  palliative  alternatives  and  counsel-ing, and  ensure patients are  competent  and  acting voluntar-
ily.  $ 127.815.  Any  eligible  patient  must  also  get  a  second opinion from another registered physician, $ 127.820, and the 
statute's  safeguards  require  physicians  to  keep  and  submit to  inspection  detailed  records  of  their  actions,  $$ 127.855, 
127.865. Even though regulation of health and safety is "primarily, 
and  historically,  a  matter  of  local  concern,"  Hillsborough County  v.  Automated  Medical  Laboratories,  Inc.,  471  U. S. 
707, 719 (1985), there is no question that the Federal Govern-ment can set uniform national standards in these areas.  See 
Raich, supra, at  9.  In connection to the  CSA, however, we find  only  one  area  in  which  Congress  set  general,  uniform 
standards of medical practice.  Title I of the Comprehensive Drug  Abuse  Prevention  and  Control  Act  of  1970,  of  which 
the CSA was Title II, provides: 

"[The  Secretary],  after  consultation  with  the  Attorney General  and  with  national  organizations  representative 

of  persons  with  knowledge  and  experience  in  the  treat-ment  of  narcotic  addicts,  shall  determine  the  appro-
priate  methods  of  professional  practice  in  the  medical treatment  of  the  narcotic addiction of  various  classes of 
narcotic  addicts,  and  shall  report  thereon  from  time  to time to the Congress."  $ 4, 84 Stat. 1241, codified at 42

272  GONZALES  v.  OREGON 

Opinion of the Court 
This provision strengthens the understanding of the CSA as 
a  statute  combating  recreational  drug  abuse,  and  also  indi-
cates that when Congress wants to regulate medical practice 
in  the  given  scheme,  it  does  so  by  explicit  language  in  the 
statute. 

In  the  face  of  the  CSA's  silence  on  the  practice  of  medi-
cine  generally  and  its  recognition  of  state  regulation  of  the 
medical profession it is difficult to defend the Attorney Gen-
eral's  declaration  that  the  statute  impliedly  criminalizes 
physician-assisted suicide.  This difficulty is compounded by 
the CSA's consistent delegation of medical judgments to the 
Secretary  and  its  otherwise  careful  allocation  of  powers  for 
enforcing  the  limited  objects  of  the  CSA.  See  Part  II-B, 
supra.  The  Government's  attempt  to  meet  this  challenge 
rests, for the most part, on the CSA's requirement that every 
Schedule  II  drug  be  dispensed  pursuant  to  a  "written  pre-
scription  of  a  practitioner."  21  U. S. C.  $ 829(a).  A  pre-
scription,  the  Government  argues,  necessarily  implies  that 
the substance is being made available to a patient for a legiti-
mate  medical  purpose.  The  statute,  in  this  view,  requires 
an  anterior  judgment  about  the  term  "medical"  or  "medi-
cine."  The  Government  contends  ordinary  usage  of  these 
words  ineluctably  refers  to  a  healing  or  curative  art,  which 
by  these  terms  cannot  embrace  the  intentional  hastening  of 
a patient's death.  It also points to the teachings of Hippoc-
rates,  the  positions  of  prominent  medical  organizations,  the 
Federal Government, and the judgment of the 49 States that 
have  not  legalized  physician-assisted  suicide  as  further  sup-
port  for  the  proposition  that  the  practice  is  not  legitimate 
medicine.  See  Brief  for  Petitioners  22-24;  Memorandum 
from  Office  of  Legal  Counsel  to  Attorney  General,  App.  to 
Pet. for Cert. 124a-130a. 

On its own, this understanding of medicine's boundaries is 
at least reasonable.  The primary problem with the Govern-
ment's  argument,  however,  is  its  assumption  that  the  CSA 

546US2 Unit: $U18 [09-04-08 12:21:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court 
impliedly authorizes an executive officer to bar a use simply 
because  it  may  be  inconsistent  with  one  reasonable  under-
standing of medical practice.  Viewed alone, the prescription 
requirement  may  support  such  an  understanding,  but  stat-
utes "should not be read as a series of unrelated and isolated 
provisions."  Gustafson  v.  Alloyd  Co.,  513  U. S.  561,  570 
(1995).  The CSA's substantive provisions and their arrange-
ment  undermine  this  assertion  of  an  expansive  federal  au-
thority to regulate medicine. 

The  statutory  criteria  for  deciding  what  substances  are 
controlled, determinations which are central to the Act, con-
sistently  connect  the  undefined  term  "drug  abuse"  with  ad-
diction  or  abnormal  effects  on  the  nervous  system.  When 
the  Attorney  General  schedules  drugs,  he  must  consider  a 
substance's psychic or physiological dependence liability.  21 
U. S. C.  $ 811(c)(7).  To  classify  a  substance  in  Schedules  II 
through V, the Attorney General must find abuse of the drug 
leads  to  psychological  or  physical  dependence.  $ 812(b). 
Indeed,  the  differentiation  of  Schedules  II  through  V  turns 
in  large  part  on  a  substance's  habit-forming  potential:  The 
more  addictive  a  substance,  the  stricter  the  controls.  Ibid. 
When  Congress  wanted  to  extend  the  CSA's  regulation  to 
substances  not  obviously  habit  forming  or  psychotropic, 
moreover, it relied not on executive ingenuity, but rather on 
specific  legislation.  See  $ 1902(a)  of  the  Anabolic  Steroids 
Control Act of 1990, 104 Stat. 4851 (placing anabolic steroids 
in Schedule III). 

The  statutory  scheme  with  which  the  CSA  is  intertwined 
further  confirms  a  more  limited  understanding  of  the  pre-
scription requirement.  When the Secretary considers Food 
and Drug Administration approval of a substance with "stim-
ulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic effect," he must forward 
the information to the Attorney General for possible schedul-
ing.  Shedding  light  on  Congress'  understanding  of  drug 
abuse,  this  requirement  appears  under  the  heading  "Abuse

Opinion of the Court 
potential."  21  U. S. C.  $ 811(f).  Similarly,  when  Congress prepared to implement the Convention on Psychotropic Sub-

stances, it did so through the CSA.  $ 801a. The  Interpretive  Rule  rests  on  a  reading  of  the  prescrip-
tion  requirement  that  is  persuasive  only  to  the  extent  one scrutinizes the provision without the illumination of the rest 
of the statute.  See Massachusetts v.  Morash, 490 U. S. 107, 
114-115  (1989).  Viewed  in  its  context,  the  prescription  re-quirement  is  better  understood  as  a  provision  that  ensures 

patients  use  controlled  substances  under  the  supervision  of a  doctor  so  as  to  prevent  addiction  and  recreational  abuse. 
As a corollary, the provision also bars doctors from peddling 
to  patients  who  crave  the  drugs  for  those  prohibited  uses. 
See Moore, 423 U. S., at 135, 143.  To read prescriptions for 
assisted suicide as constituting "drug abuse" under the CSA 
is discordant with the phrase's consistent use throughout the 
statute, not to mention its ordinary meaning. 

The  Government's  interpretation  of  the  prescription  re-
quirement  also  fails  under  the  objection  that  the  Attorney 
General  is  an  unlikely  recipient  of  such  broad  authority, 
given  the  Secretary's  primacy  in  shaping  medical  policy 
under the CSA, and the statute's otherwise careful allocation 
of  decisionmaking  powers.  Just  as  the  conventions  of  ex-
pression indicate that Congress is unlikely to alter a statute's 
obvious  scope  and  division  of  authority  through  muffled 
hints,  the  background  principles  of  our  federal  system  also 
belie  the  notion  that  Congress  would  use  such  an  obscure 
grant of authority to regulate areas traditionally supervised 
by  the  States'  police  power.  It  is  unnecessary  even  to  con-
sider  the  application  of  clear  statement  requirements,  see, 
e. g., United States v.  Bass, 404 U. S. 336, 349 (1971); cf. BFP 
v.  Resolution  Trust  Corporation,  511  U. S.  531,  544-546 
(1994), or presumptions against pre-emption, see, e. g., Rush 
Prudential HMO, Inc. v.  Moran, 536 U. S. 355, 387 (2002), to 
reach  this  commonsense  conclusion.  For  all  these  reasons, 
we conclude the CSA's prescription requirement does not au-

and  their  suability  in,  the  federal  courts  to  the  same  extent  [as]  non-
national  banks."  Mercantile  Nat.  Bank  at  Dallas  v.  Langdeau,  371 
U. S.  555,  565-566.  In  the  Judicial  Code  of  1911,  Congress  combined 
two  formerly  discrete  provisions  on  proceedings  involving  national 
banks, but retained without alteration the "located" clause.  Finally, as 
part  of  the  1948  Judicial  Code  revision,  Congress  enacted  $ 1348  in  its 
current form.  Pp. 309-312. 

(b)  The Fourth Circuit advanced three principal reasons for deciding 
that  Wachovia  is  "located"  in,  and  therefore  a  "citizen"  of,  every  State 
in which it maintains a branch office.  First, consulting dictionaries, the 
court observed that the term "located" refers to "physical presence in a 
place."  Next,  the  court  noted  that  $ 1348  uses  two  distinct  terms  to 
refer  to  the  presence  of  a  banking  association:  "established"  and  "lo-
cated."  The court concluded that, to give independent meaning to each 
word, "established" should be read to refer to the bank's charter location 
and  "located,"  to  the  place  where  the  bank  has  a  physical  presence. 
Finally, the court  relied on Citizens & Southern Nat. Bank v.  Bougas, 
434 U. S.  35,  in  which this  Court  interpreted  the term  "located" in  the 
former  venue  statute  for  national  banks, see 12  U. S. C. $ 94 (1976  ed.), 
as encompassing any county in which a bank maintains a branch office. 
Viewing  the  jurisdiction  and  venue  statutes  as  pertaining  to  the  same 
subject  matter,  the  court  concluded  that,  under  the  in  pari  materia 
canon, the two statutes should be interpreted consistently.  Pp. 312-313. 

(c)  None of the Fourth Circuit's rationales persuade this Court to read 

$ 1348 to attribute to a national bank, for diversity-jurisdiction purposes, 
the  citizenship  of  each  State  in  which  the  bank  has  established  branch 
operations.  First,  the  term  "located,"  as  it  appears  in  the  National 
Bank  Act,  has  no  fixed,  plain  meaning.  In  some  provisions,  the  word 
unquestionably refers to the site of the banking association's designated 
main  office,  but  in  others,  "located"  apparently  refers  to  or  includes 
branch offices.  Recognizing the controlling significance of context, this 
Court stated in Bougas: "There is no enduring rigidity about the word 
`located.' "  434 U. S., at 44.  Second, Congress may well have compre-
hended the words "located" and "established," as used in $ 1348, as syn-
onymous  terms.  When  Congress  enacted  $ 1348's  statutory  predeces-
sors and $ 1348 itself, a national bank was almost always "located" only 
in  the  State  in  which  it  was  "established,"  under  any  of  the  proffered 
definitions of the two words.  For with rare exceptions a national bank 
could not operate a branch outside its home State until 1994, when Con-
gress  broadly  authorized  national  banks  to  establish  branches  across 
state  lines.  Congress'  use  of  the  two  terms  may  be  best  explained  as 
a  coincidence  of  statutory  codification.  Deriving  from  separate  provi-
sions  enacted  in  different  years,  the  word  "established"  appearing  in 
the  first  paragraph  of  $ 1348  and  the  word  "located"  appearing  in  the

Syllabus 
second paragraph were placed in the same section in the 1911 revision. 
The codifying Act stated that provisions substantially the same as exist-
ing  statutes  should not  be  treated  as  new enactments.  Thus,  it  is  un-
surprising  that,  in  1947,  this  Court,  referring  to  a  national  bank's  citi-
zenship under the 1911 Act, used the terms "established" and "located" 
as  alternatives.  See  Cope  v.  Anderson,  331  U. S.  461,  467.  Finally, 
Bougas  does  not  control  $ 1348's  meaning.  Although  it  is  true  that, 
under the in pari materia canon, statutes addressing the same subject 
matter generally should be read " `as if they were one law,' " Erlenbaugh 
v.  United  States,  409  U. S.  239,  243,  venue  and  subject-matter  jurisdic-
tion  are  not  concepts  of  the  same  order.  Venue,  largely  a  matter  of 
litigational convenience, is waived if not timely raised.  Subject-matter 
jurisdiction, on the other hand, concerns a court's competence to adjudi-
cate  a  particular  category  of  cases;  a  matter  far  weightier  than  venue, 
subject-matter jurisdiction must be considered by the court on its own 
motion, even if no party raises an objection.  Cognizant that venue "is 
primarily  a  matter  of  choosing  a  convenient  forum,"  Leroy  v.  Great 
Western United Corp., 443 U. S. 173, 180, the Court in Bougas stressed 
that  its  "interpretation  of  [the  former]  $ 94  [would]  not  inconvenience 
the  bank  or  unfairly  burden  it  with  distant  litigation,"  434  U. S., at  44, 
n. 10.  Subject-matter jurisdiction, however,  does not  entail an  assess-
ment of convenience.  It poses the question "whether" the Legislature 
empowered the court to hear cases of a certain genre.  Thus, the consid-
erations that account for the Bougas decision are inapplicable to $ 1348, 
a  prescription  governing  subject-matter  jurisdiction,  and  the  Court  of 
Appeals  erred  in  interpreting  $ 1348  in  pari  materia  with  the  former 

$ 94.  Significantly,  Bougas'  reading  of  former  $ 94  effectively  aligned 
the treatment of national banks for venue purposes with the treatment 
of state banks and corporations.  By contrast, the Fourth Circuit's deci-
sion  in  this  case  severely  constricts  national  banks'  access  to  diversity 
jurisdiction  as  compared  to  the  access  generally  available  to  corpora-
tions, for corporations ordinarily rank as citizens only of States in which 
they are incorporated or maintain their principal place of business, and 
are not deemed citizens of every State in which they maintain a business 
establishment.  Pp. 313-318.

place  designated  in  the  bank's  articles  of  association  as  the location  of  its  main  office?  Or  does  it  mean,  in  addition,  as 

respondents  urge  and  the  Court  of  Appeals  held,  that  a  na-tional  bank  is  a  citizen  of  every  State  in  which  it  maintains 
a branch? Recognizing  that  "located"  is  not  a  word  of  "enduring  ri-
gidity," Citizens & Southern Nat. Bank v.  Bougas, 434 U. S. 35,  44  (1977),  but  one  that  gains  its  precise  meaning  from 
context, we hold that a national bank, for $ 1348 purposes, is a citizen of the State  in which  its main  office, as  set forth in 
its  articles  of  association,  is  located.  Were  we  to  hold,  as the Court of Appeals did, that a national bank is additionally 
a citizen of every State in which it has established a branch, the  access  of  a  federally  chartered  bank  to  a  federal  forum 
would  be  drastically  curtailed  in  comparison  to  the  access afforded  state  banks  and  other  state-incorporated  entities. 
Congress, we are satisfied, created no such anomaly.

Petitioner  Wachovia  Bank,  National  Association  (Wacho-via),  is  a  national  banking  association  with  its  designated 

main  office  in  Charlotte,  North  Carolina.1  Wachovia  oper-ates branch offices in many States, including South Carolina.

The  place  so  designated  serves  as  the  bank's  "main  office."  Changes  in 
the location of that office are effected by amendment to the bank's articles 
of association.  See 12 U. S. C. $$ 21a, 30(b); 12 CFR $ 5.40(d)(2)(ii) (2005).

308  WACHOVIA  BANK,  N.  A.  v.  SCHMIDT 

Opinion of the Court 
The  litigation  before  us  commenced  when  plaintiff-respondent  Daniel  G.  Schmidt  III  and  others,  citizens  of 

South  Carolina,  sued  Wachovia  in  a  South  Carolina  state court for fraudulently inducing them to participate in an ille-
gitimate  tax  shelter.  Shortly  thereafter,  Wachovia  filed  a petition  in  the  United  States  District  Court  for  the  District 
of  South  Carolina,  seeking  to  compel  arbitration  of  the  dis-pute.  As  the  sole  basis  for  federal-court  jurisdiction,  Wa-
chovia  alleged  the  parties'  diverse  citizenship.  See  28 U. S. C.  $ 1332.  The  District  Court  denied  Wachovia's  peti-
tion  on  the  merits;  neither  the  parties  nor  the  court  ques-tioned  the  existence  of  federal  subject-matter  jurisdiction. 
On  appeal,  a  divided  Fourth  Circuit  panel  determined  that the  District  Court  lacked  diversity  jurisdiction  over  the  ac-
tion;  it  therefore  vacated  the  judgment  and  instructed  the 
District Court to dismiss the case. The  Court  of  Appeals'  majority  observed  that  Wachovia's 

citizenship  for  diversity  purposes  is  controlled  by  $ 1348, which  provides  that  "national  banking  associations"  are 
"deemed citizens of the States in which they are respectively 
located."  As  the  panel  majority  read  $ 1348,  Wachovia  is "located"  in,  and  is  therefore  a  "citizen"  of,  every  State  in 

which it maintains a branch office.  Thus Wachovia's branch operations  in  South  Carolina,  in  the  majority's  view,  ren-
dered the bank a citizen of South Carolina.  Given the South 
authorized limited branch operations in the bank's home State in 1927 and 
1933.  McFadden  Act  (Branch  Banks),  1927,  $ 7(c),  44  Stat.  1228;  GlassSteagall Act, 1933, $ 23, 48 Stat. 189-190.  These Acts, like the 1865 enact-
ment, allowed interstate branching only under narrow "grandfather" pro-
visions.  McFadden  Act,  $ 7(a)-(b),  44  Stat.  1228;  see  Girard  Bank  v. 
Board of Governors of Fed. Reserve System, 748 F. 2d 838, 840 (CA3 1984) 
(observing  that  only  two  national  banks  had  "grandfathered"  interstate 
branches).  Not  until  1994  did  Congress  grant  national  banks  broad  au-
thority to establish branch offices across state lines.  See Riegle-Neal In-
terstate  Banking  and  Branching  Efficiency  Act  of  1994,  $ 101,  108  Stat.

court.  388 F. 3d 414, 432 (CA4 2004). Circuit Judge King dissented.  He read $ 1348 and its stat-
utory  precursors  to  provide  national  banks  with  "the  same access  to  federal  courts  as  that  accorded  other  banks  and 
corporations."  Id.,  at  434.  On  his  reading,  Wachovia  is  a citizen  only  of  North  Carolina,  the  State  in  which  its  main 
office  is  located,  not  of  every  State  in  which  it  maintains  a branch  office;  accordingly,  he  concluded,  Wachovia's  petition 
qualified for federal-court adjudication.3 We  granted  certiorari  to  resolve  the  disagreement  among

When  Congress  first  authorized  national  banks  in  1863,  it specified  that  any  "suits,  actions,  and  proceedings  by  and 
against  [them  could]  be  had"  in  federal  court.  See  Act  of Feb.  25,  1863,  $ 59,  12  Stat.  681.  National  banks  thus  could

Opinion of the Court 
solely  because  they  were  national  banks,  without  regard  to diversity, amount in controversy or the existence of a federal 

question in the usual sense."  Mercantile Nat. Bank at Dal-las v.  Langdeau, 371 U. S. 555, 565-566 (1963).  State banks, 
however, like other state-incorporated entities, could initiate actions  in federal court only  on the  basis of diversity of citi-
zenship  or  the  existence  of  a  federal  question.  See  Petri  v. 
Commercial  Nat.  Bank  of  Chicago,  142  U. S.  644,  648-649 (1892). 

Congress ended national banks' automatic qualification for federal  jurisdiction  in  1882.  An  enactment  that  year  pro-
vided in relevant part: 

"[T]he  jurisdiction  for  suits  hereafter  brought  by  or against  any  association  established  under  any  law  pro-

viding for national-banking associations . . . shall be the same as, and not other than, the jurisdiction for suits by 
or  against  banks  not  organized  under  any  law  of  the United  States  which  do  or  might  do  banking  business 
where  such  national-banking  associations  may  be  doing business when such suits may be begun[.]"  Act of July 
12, 1882, $ 4, 22 Stat. 163. 
Under  this  measure,  national  banks  could  no  longer  invoke federal-court jurisdiction solely "on the ground of their Fed-

eral origin," Petri, 142 U. S., at 649; instead, for federal juris-dictional  purposes,  Congress  placed  national  banks  "on  the 
same  footing  as  the  banks  of  the  state  where  they  were  lo-cated,"  Leather  Manufacturers'  Bank  v.  Cooper,  120  U. S. 
778, 780 (1887). In  1887  revisions  to  prescriptions  on  federal  jurisdiction, 
Congress replaced the 1882 provision on jurisdiction over na-tional banks and first used the "located" language today con-
tained in $ 1348.  The 1887 provision stated in relevant part: 

"[A]ll  national  banking  associations  established  under the  laws  of  the  United  States  shall,  for  the  purposes  of 

all  actions  by  or  against  them,  real,  personal  or  mixed, and  all  suits  in  equity,  be  deemed  citizens  of  the  States

in which they are respectively located; and in such cases the circuit and district courts shall not have jurisdiction 

other  than  such  as  they  would  have  in  cases  between individual  citizens  of  the  same  State."  Act  of  Mar.  3, 
1887, $ 4, 24 Stat. 554-555 (emphasis added).4 
Like  its  1882  predecessor,  the  1887  Act  "sought  to  limit . . .  the  access  of  national  banks  to,  and  their  suability  in,  the 

federal  courts  to  the  same  extent  to  which  non-national banks  [were]  so  limited." 

Langdeau,  371  U. S.,  at  565-566. In the  Judicial Code of 1911,

5  Congress combined two for-

merly  discrete  provisions  on  proceedings  involving  national banks,  but  retained  without  alteration  the  clause  deeming 

national banks to be "citizens of the States in which they are respectively  located."  Act  of  Mar.  3,  1911,  $ 24  (Sixteenth), 
36  Stat.  1091-1093.6  Finally,  as  part  of  the  1948  Judicial 

4 The term "established under" did appear in the 1882 and 1887 formula-
tions, in both texts as synonymous with the term "organized under."  In 
neither measure is the word used in a locational sense. 

5 Earlier, in 1888, Congress had revised the 1887 prescription by adding 

as a  separate paragraph this caveat:  "The provisions of this section  shall 
not be held to affect the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States in 
cases  commenced  by  the  United  States  or  by  direction  of  any  officer 
thereof,  or  cases  for  winding  up  the  affairs  of  any  such  bank."  Act  of 
Aug. 13, 1888, $ 4, 25 Stat. 436. 

6 In full, the 1911 text stated: 

"The  district  courts  shall  have  original  jurisdiction  .  .  .  [o]f  all  cases 
commenced  by  the  United  States,  or  by  direction  of  any  officer  thereof, 
against  any  national  banking  association,  and  cases  for  winding  up  the 
affairs  of  any  such  bank;  and  of  all  suits  brought  by  any  banking  asso-
ciation  established  in  the  district  for  which  the  court  is  held,  under  the 
provisions of title `National Banks,' Revised Statutes, to enjoin the Comp-
troller of the Currency, or any receiver acting under his direction, as pro-
vided  by  said  title.  And  all  national  banking  associations  established 
under  the  laws  of  the  United  States  shall,  for  the  purposes  of  all  other 
actions by or against them, real, personal, or mixed, and all suits in equity, 
be deemed citizens of  the States in  which  they are respectively  located." 
36 Stat. 1091-1093. 

The  first  sentence  of  this  formulation  merged  the  1888  caveat  with  text, 
including the word "established," originally contained in the Act of Dec. 1,

312  WACHOVIA  BANK,  N.  A.  v.  SCHMIDT 

Opinion of the Court 
Code  revision,  Congress  enacted  $ 1348  in  its  current  form. Act of June 25, 1948, 62 Stat. 933.  The provision now reads: 

"The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any  civil action  commenced by  the  United  States,  or by 
direction  of  any  officer  thereof,  against  any  national banking  association,  any  civil  action  to  wind  up  the  af-
fairs of any such association, and any action by a banking association established in the district for which the court 
is held, under chapter 2 of Title 12, to enjoin the Comp-troller of the Currency, or any receiver acting under his 
direction, as provided by such chapter. "All  national  banking  associations  shall,  for  the  pur-
poses of all other actions by or against them, be deemed citizens  of  the  States  in  which  they  are  respectively  lo-
cated."  28 U. S. C. $ 1348. 

III 
The  Fourth  Circuit  panel  majority  advanced  three  princi-pal  reasons  for  deciding  that  Wachovia  is  "located"  in,  and 

therefore  a  "citizen"  of,  every  State  in  which  it  maintains a  branch  office.  First,  consulting  dictionaries,  the  Court  of 
Appeals observed that "[i]n ordinary parlance" the term "lo-cated" refers to "physical presence in a place."  388 F. 3d, at 
416-417  (internal  quotation  marks  omitted).  Banks  have  a physical  presence,  the  Fourth  Circuit  stated,  wherever  they 
operate branches.  Id., at 417.  Next, the court noted, "Sec-tion 1348 uses two distinct terms to refer to the presence of 
a  banking  association:  `established'  and  `located.' "  Id.,  at 419.  "To  give  independent  meaning"  to  each  word,  the 
court  said,  "it  is  most  reasonable  to  understand  the  place where  a  national  bank  is  `established'  to  refer  to  a  bank's 
charter location, and to understand the place where it is `lo-cated' to  refer  to the  place or places  where  it  has  a physical 

1873, $ 629 (Tenth to Eleventh), 18 Stat. 111.  The second sentence, includ-
ing the word "located," derives from the 1887 formulation.

Opinion of the Court 
presence."  Ibid.  Finally,  the  Court  of  Appeals  stressed that in Citizens &  Southern Nat.  Bank v.  Bougas, 434  U. S. 

35  (1977),  this  Court  interpreted  the  term  "located"  in  the former  venue  statute  for  national  banks,  see  12  U. S. C.  $ 94 
(1976 ed.), as encompassing any county in which a bank main-tains a branch office.  388 F. 3d, at 419-420.  Reasoning that 
"the jurisdiction and venue statutes pertain to the same sub-ject matter, namely the amenability of national banking asso-
ciations  to  suit  in  federal  court,"  the  panel  majority  con-cluded  that,  "under  the 

in  pari  materia  canon[,]  the  two statutes should be interpreted" consistently.  Id., at 422. 

IV 
None  of  the  Court  of  Appeals'  rationales  persuade  us  to read $ 1348 to attribute to a national bank, for diversity juris-

diction  purposes,  the  citizenship  of  each  State  in  which  the bank has established branch operations.  First, the term "lo-
cated," as it appears in the National Bank Act, has no fixed, plain  meaning.  In  some  provisions,  the  word  unquestion-
ably refers to a single place: the  site of the  banking associa-tion's  designated  main  office.  See,  e. g.,  12  U. S. C.  $ 52  (na-
tional  bank's  capital  stock  certificates  must  state  "the  name and location of the association"); $ 55 (requiring notice of sale 
of capital stock "in a newspaper of the city or town in which the  bank  is  located");  $ 75  (bank's  regular  annual  sharehold-
ers'  meeting  shall  be  rescheduled  when  it  "falls  on  a  legal holiday in the State in which the bank is located"); $ 182 (re-
quiring  publication  of  a  notice  of  dissolution  "in  the  city  or town  in  which  the  association  is  located").  In  other  provi-
sions,  "located"  apparently  refers  to  or  includes  branch  of-fices.  See, 

e. g.,  $ 36( j)  (defining  "branch"  to  include  "any branch place of business located in any State"); $ 85 (limiting 

interest  rate  charged  by  national  bank  to  "rate  allowed  by the  laws  of  the  State,  Territory,  or  District  where  the  bank 
is  located")  (construed  in  OCC  Interpretive  Letter  No.  822 (Feb. 17, 1998), [1997-1998 Transfer Binder] CCH Fed. Bank-

circumstances  when  bank  is  "located  and  doing  business  in any place the population of which does not exceed five thou-
sand  inhabitants")  (construed  in  12  CFR  $ 7.1001  (2005)).7 Recognizing the controlling significance of context, we stated 
in  Bougas,  regarding  a  venue  provision  for  national  banks: "There  is  no  enduring  rigidity  about  the  word  `located.' " 
434 U. S., at 44. Second, Congress may well have comprehended the words 
"located"  and  "established,"  as  used  in  $ 1348,  not  as  con-trasting,  but  as  synonymous  or  alternative  terms.  When 
Congress  enacted  $ 1348's  statutory  predecessors  and  then $ 1348  itself,  a  national  bank  was  almost  always  "located" 
only  in  the  State  in  which  it  was  "established,"  under  any of  the  proffered  definitions  of  the  two  words,  for,  with  rare 
exceptions,  a  national  bank  could  not  operate  a  branch  out-side  its  home  State.  Not  until  1994  did  Congress  provide 
broad authorization for national banks to establish branches across  state  lines.  See  supra,  at  307-308,  n.  2.  Congress' 
use of the two terms may be best explained as a coincidence of statutory codification.  Deriving from separate provisions 
enacted in different years, the word "established" appearing in  the  first  paragraph  of  $ 1348  and  the  word  "located"  ap-
pearing  in  the  second  paragraph  were  placed  in  the  same section in the 1911 revision of the Judicial Code.  See supra, 
at 311-312, n. 6.  The codifying Act explicitly stated that "so far  as  [its  provisions  were]  substantially  the  same  as  exist-

7 The  Court  of  Appeals  did  not  overlook  these  nonuniform  uses  of  the 
word  "located" in  various provisions  of  the National  Bank  Act.  See  388 
F.  3d  414,  425  (CA4  2004).  Nevertheless,  it  declared  that,  in  $ 1348,  "lo-
cated" unambiguously means "physically present."  Ibid. (internal quota-
tion  marks  omitted).  The  court  did  not  say  what  facilities  other  than 
branch  offices,  for  example,  storage  sites  or  even  automated  teller  ma-
chines,  would  suffice  to  establish  a  bank's  physical  presence.  Cf.  Tr.  of 
Oral Arg. 36-37 (counsel for respondents stated that an ATM, although an 
arguable  question,  probably  would  suffice  to  locate  a  bank  in  a  State  for 

$ 1348 purposes).

and  "established"  as  alternatives.  See  Cope  v.  Anderson, 331  U. S.  461,  467  ("For  jurisdictional  purposes,  a  national

Finally,  Bougas  does  not  control  the  meaning  of  $ 1348. In  that  case,  we  construed  a  now-repealed  venue  provision, 

which  stated  that  actions  against  national  banking  associa-tions could be filed "in any  State, county, or  municipal court 
in the county or city in which said association [was] located." 434  U. S.,  at  35-36  (quoting  12  U. S. C.  $ 94  (1976  ed.)).  We 
held that, for purposes of this provision, a national bank was located,  and  venue  was  therefore  proper,  in  any  county  or 
city where the bank maintained a branch office.  434 U. S., at 44-45.  True, under  the  in pari materia  canon  of statutory 

8 Context also matters in assigning  meaning to the word  "established." 
See,  e. g.,  Convention  Between  the  Government  of  the  United  States  of 
America and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
Northern Ireland for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention 
of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital Gains, 
S. Treaty Doc. No. 107-19, Art. 5, pp. 8-9 (2002) ("For the purposes of this 
Convention,  the  term  `permanent  establishment'  means  a  fixed  place  of 
business  through  which  the  business  of  an  enterprise  is  wholly  or  partly 
carried on . . . .").  Given the character of the proceedings covered by the 
first  paragraph of  $ 1348,  see  supra,  at  312,  one  might read  "established" 
as referring to the bank's main office as set forth in its articles of associa-
tion.  Other  readings  mentioned  in  Court  of  Appeals  opinions  are  the 
bank's principal place of business and the place listed in the bank's organi-
zation certificate.  See Horton v. Bank One, N. A., 387 F. 3d 426, 434 (CA5 
2004); Firstar Bank, N. A. v. Faul, 253 F. 3d 982, 992 (CA7 2001).  Because 
this issue is not presented by the parties or necessary to today's decision, 
we express no opinion on it.  Cf. ibid.

Opinion of the Court 
construction,  statutes  addressing  the  same  subject  matter generally  should  be  read  " `as  if  they  were  one  law.' " 

Er-
lenbaugh v.  United States, 409  U. S. 239, 243  (1972) (quoting 
United  States  v.  Freeman,  3  How.  556,  564  (1845)).  But 
venue and subject-matter jurisdiction are not concepts of the same  order.  Venue  is  largely  a  matter  of  litigational  con-

venience; accordingly, it is waived if not timely raised.  See, 
e. g.,  Heckler  v.  Ringer,  466  U. S.  602,  638,  n.  25  (1984) (

Stevens,  J.,  concurring  in  judgment  in  part  and  dissent-
ing  in  part);  Fed.  Rule  Civ.  Proc.  12(h)(1).  Subject-matter jurisdiction,  on  the  other  hand,  concerns  a  court's  compe-

tence  to  adjudicate  a  particular  category  of  cases;  a  matter 
far  weightier  than  venue,  subject-matter  jurisdiction  must 
be  considered  by  the  court  on  its  own  motion,  even  if 
no  party  raises  an  objection.  See,  e. g.,  Mansfield,  C.  & 
L.  M.  R.  Co.  v.  Swan,  111  U. S.  379,  382  (1884);  Fed.  Rule 
Civ. Proc. 12(h)(3). 

Cognizant that venue "is primarily a matter of choosing a 
convenient forum," Leroy v.  Great Western United Corp., 443 
U. S.  173,  180  (1979),  the  Court  in  Bougas  stressed  that  its 
"interpretation of [the former] $ 94 [would] not inconvenience 
the  bank  or  unfairly  burden  it  with  distant  litigation,"  434 
U. S.,  at  44,  n.  10.  Subject-matter  jurisdiction,  however, 
does  not  entail  an  assessment  of  convenience.  It  poses  a 
"whether," not a "where" question: Has the Legislature em-
powered  the  court  to  hear  cases  of  a  certain  genre?  See 
Neirbo  Co.  v.  Bethlehem  Shipbuilding  Corp.,  308  U. S.  165, 
168 (1939) ("This basic difference between the court's power 
and  the  litigant's  convenience  is  historic  in  the  federal 
courts.").  Thus, the  considerations  that account  for  our de-
cision  in  Bougas  are  inapplicable  to  $ 1348,  a  prescription 
governing  subject-matter  jurisdiction,  and  the  Court  of  Ap-
peals  erred  in  interpreting  $ 1348  in  pari  materia  with  the 
former $ 94. 

Significantly,  this  Court's  reading  of  the  venue  provision 
in Bougas effectively aligned the treatment of national banks

Opinion of the Court 
for  venue  purposes  with  the  treatment  of  state  banks  and 
corporations.  For  venue  in  suits  against  state  banks  and 
other  state-created  corporations  typically  lies  wherever 
those entities have business establishments.  See 19 C. J. S., 
Corporations $ 717(d), p. 374, n. 30 (1990) (under typical state 
venue  statutes,  "[v]enue  in  action  against  domestic  corpo-
ration can be laid in any county where corporation maintains 
branch office").  By contrast, the Court of Appeals' decision 
in the instant case severely constricts national banks' access 
to  diversity  jurisdiction  as  compared  to  the  access  available 
to  corporations  generally.  For  purposes  of  diversity,  a  cor-
poration  surely  is  not  deemed  a  citizen  of  every  State  in 
which  it  maintains  a  business  establishment.  See  Penn-
sylvania  R.  Co.  v.  St.  Louis,  A.  & T. H. R.  Co.,  118  U. S. 
290,  295-296  (1886).  Rather,  under  28  U. S. C.  $ 1332(c)(1), 
a  corporation  is  "deemed  to  be  a  citizen"  only  of  "any  State 
by  which  it  has  been  incorporated"  and  "of  the  State  where 
it  has  its  principal  place  of  business."  Accordingly,  while 
corporations  ordinarily  rank  as  citizens  of  at  most  2  States, 
Wachovia,  under  the  Court  of  Appeals'  novel  citizenship 
rule, would be a citizen of 16 States.  See FDIC Institution 
Directory,  available  at  http://www2.fdic.gov/idasp/main.asp.9 
Bougas does not call for this anomalous result. 

9 To  achieve  complete  parity  with  state  banks  and  other  state-
incorporated  entities,  a  national  banking  association  would  have  to  be 
deemed  a  citizen  of  both  the  State  of  its  main  office  and  the  State  of  its 
principal  place  of  business.  See  Horton,  387  F.  3d,  at  431,  and  n.  26; 
Firstar Bank, N. A., 253 F. 3d, at 993-994.  Congress has prescribed that 
a corporation "shall be deemed to be a citizen of any State by which it has 
been  incorporated  and  of  the  State  where  it  has  its  principal  place  of 
business."  28  U. S. C.  $ 1332(c)(1)  (emphasis  added).  The  counterpart 
provision for national banking associations, $ 1348, however, does not refer 
to "principal place of business"; it simply deems such associations "citizens 
of  the  States  in  which  they  are  respectively  located."  The  absence  of  a 
"principal place of business" reference in $ 1348 may be of scant practical 
significance  for,  in almost  every  case,  as  in  this  one,  the  location of  a  na-
tional bank's main office and of its principal place of business coincide.

318  WACHOVIA  BANK,  N.  A.  v.  SCHMIDT 

Opinion of the Court 

V 
To summarize, "located," as its appearances in the banking laws  reveal,  see 

supra,  at  313-314,  is  a  chameleon  word;  its meaning depends on the context in and purpose for which it 

is used. In  the  context  of  venue,  "located"  may  refer  to  multiple 
places, for a venue prescription, e. g., the current and former 12  U. S. C.  $ 94,  presupposes  subject-matter  jurisdiction  and 
simply delineates where within a given judicial system a case may be maintained.  See, e. g., 28 U. S. C. $ 1391(c) (for venue 
purposes,  "a  corporation  shall  be  deemed  to  reside  in  any judicial district in which it is subject to personal jurisdiction 
at the time the action is commenced"). In  contrast,  in  $ 1348,  "located"  appears  in  a  prescription 
governing  not  venue  but  federal-court  subject-matter  ju-risdiction.  Concerning  access  to  the  federal  court  system, 

$ 1348  deems  national  banks "citizens  of the  States in  which they  are  respectively  located."  There  is  no  reason  to  sup-
pose Congress used those words to effect a radical departure from the norm.  An individual who resides in more than one 
State is regarded, for purposes of federal subject-matter (di-versity)  jurisdiction,  as  a  citizen  of  but  one  State.  See 
Newman-Green,  Inc.  v.  Alfonzo-Larrain,  490  U. S.  826,  828 (1989)  (an  individual  is  deemed  a  citizen  of  the  State  of  her 
domicil);  Williamson  v.  Osenton,  232  U. S.  619,  625  (1914) (domicil  is  the  "technically  preeminent  headquarters"  of  a 
person; "[i]n its nature it is one").  Similarly, a corporation's citizenship  derives,  for  diversity  jurisdiction  purposes,  from 
its  State  of  incorporation  and  principal  place  of  business. $ 1332(c)(1).  It  is  not  deemed  a  citizen  of  every  State  in 
which  it  conducts  business  or  is  otherwise  amenable  to  per-sonal jurisdiction.  Reading $ 1348 in this context, one would 
sensibly "locate" a national bank for the very same purpose, 
i. e.,  qualification for  diversity  jurisdiction,  in  the  State  des-
ignated in its articles of association as its main office.

Opinion of the Court 
Treating  venue  and  subject-matter  jurisdiction  prescrip-tions  as  in  pari  materia,  388  F.  3d,  at  422-423,  the  Court 

of  Appeals  majority  overlooked  the  discrete  offices  of  those concepts.  See supra,  at 315-316; cf. Cook,  "Substance" and 
"Procedure"  in  the  Conflict  of  Laws,  42  Yale  L.  J.  333,  337 (1933) ("The tendency to assume  that a  word which appears 
in  two  or  more  legal  rules,  and  so  in  connection  with  more than  one  purpose,  has  and  should  have  precisely  the  same 
scope  in  all  of  them,  runs  all  through  legal  discussions.  It has  all  the  tenacity  of  original  sin  and  must  constantly  be 
guarded  against.").  The  resulting  Fourth  Circuit  decision rendered national banks singularly disfavored corporate bod-
ies  with  regard  to  their  access  to  federal  courts.  The  lan-guage of $ 1348 does not mandate that incongruous outcome, 
nor does this Court's precedent. 

* * * 
For the reasons stated, the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit is reversed, and the 

case  is  remanded  for  further  proceedings  consistent  with this opinion. 

It is so ordered.

Opinion of the Court 
the legislation both proposed and enacted under its auspices immediately following ratification of the Constitution demon-

strate  that  it  was  intended  not  just  as  a  grant  of  legislative authority to Congress, but also to authorize limited subordi-
nation of state sovereign immunity in the bankruptcy arena. Foremost on the minds of those who adopted the Clause were 
the  intractable  problems,  not  to  mention  the  injustice,  cre-ated by one State's imprisoning of debtors who had been dis-
charged  (from  prison  and  of  their  debts)  in  and  by  another State.  As  discussed  below,  to  remedy  this  problem,  the 
very  first  Congresses  considered,  and  the  Sixth  Congress enacted, bankruptcy legislation authorizing federal courts to, 
among other things, issue writs of habeas corpus directed at state  officials  ordering  the  release  of  debtors  from  state 
prisons. We acknowledge that statements in both the majority and 
the dissenting opinions in Seminole

Opinion of the Court 
Well into the 18th century, imprisonment for debt was still ubiquitous  in  England 

4  and  the  American  Colonies.  Bank-

ruptcy  and  insolvency  laws  remained  as  much  concerned with  ensuring  full  satisfaction  of  creditors  (and,  relatedly, 

preventing debtors' flight to parts unknown 5) as with secur-ing  new  beginnings  for  debtors.  Illustrative  of  bankruptcy 
laws' harsh treatment of debtors during this period was that debtors  often  fared  worse  than  common  criminals  in  prison; 
unfortunate insolvents, unlike criminals, were forced to pro-vide  their  own  food,  fuel,  and  clothing  while  behind  bars. 
See B. Mann, Republic of Debtors: Bankruptcy in the Age of American Independence 78-108 (2002). 

Common  as  imprisonment  itself  was,  the  American  Colo-nies,  and  later  the  several  States,  had  wildly  divergent 
schemes  for discharging  debtors  and  their  debts.  Id.,

the person of the debtor from arrest within the State of New Jersey."

misses  the  point;  text  aside,  the  Framers,  in  adopting  the 
Bankruptcy  Clause,  plainly  intended  to  give  Congress  the 
power  to  redress  the  rampant  injustice  resulting  from 
States'  refusal  to  respect  one  another's  discharge  orders. 
As demonstrated by the First Congress' immediate consider-
ation  and  the  Sixth  Congress'  enactment  of  a  provision 
granting federal courts the authority to release debtors from 
state prisons, the power to enact bankruptcy legislation was 
understood  to  carry  with  it  the  power  to  subordinate  state 
sovereignty, albeit within a limited sphere. 

The  ineluctable  conclusion,  then,  is  that  States  agreed  in 
the plan of the Convention not to assert any sovereign immu-
nity  defense  they  might  have  had  in  proceedings  brought 
pursuant  to  "Laws  on  the  subject  of  Bankruptcies."  See

Opinion of the Court 

I 
The  genesis  of  the  underlying  litigation  in  this  case  was ConAgra's  attempt  to  enforce  its  patent  for  "A  Method  for 

Browning  Precooked  Whole  Muscle  Meat  Products,"  U.  S. Patent  No.  5,952,027  ('027  patent).  In  early  2000,  ConAgra 
issued  a  general  warning  to  companies  who  sold  equipment and processes for browning precooked meats explaining that 
it  intended to  " `aggressively protect  all of  [its] rights  under [the  '027]  patent.' "  375  F.  3d  1341,  1344  (CA  Fed.  2004). 
Petitioner Unitherm sold such processes, but did not receive ConAgra's warning.  ConAgra also contacted its direct com-
petitors  in  the  precooked  meat  business,  announcing  that  it was " `making the '027 Patent and corresponding patents that 
may  issue  available  for  license  at  a  royalty  rate  of  10c  per pound.' "  Id.,

failure to make timely assertion of the right before a tribunal having jurisdiction to determine it"). 

The  text  of  Rule  50(b)  confirms  that  respondent's  prever-dict  Rule  50(a)  motion  did  not  present  the  District  Court 
with the option of ordering a new trial.  That text provides that a district court may  only order a new trial on the basis 
of issues raised in a preverdict Rule 50(a) motion when "rul-ing  on  a  renewed  motion"  under  Rule  50(b).  Accordingly, 
even  if  the  District  Court  was  inclined  to  grant  a  new  trial on  the  basis  of  arguments  raised  in  respondent's  preverdict 
motion,  it  was  without  the  power  to  do  so  under  Rule  50(b) absent  a  postverdict  motion  pursuant  to  that  Rule.  Conse-
quently, the Court of Appeals was similarly powerless. Similarly,  the  text  and  application  of  Rule  50(a)  support 
our  determination  that  respondent  may  not  challenge  the sufficiency of the evidence on appeal on the basis of the Dis-
trict Court's denial of its Rule  50(a) motion.  The Rule  pro-vides  that  "the  court

that the 1971 Convention does not apply to hoasca.  The Tenth Circuit 
affirmed. 

Held:  The  courts  below  did  not  err  in  determining  that  the  Government 

failed to demonstrate, at the preliminary injunction stage, a compelling 
interest in barring the UDV's sacramental use of hoasca.  Pp. 427-439. 

1.  This  Court  rejects  the  Government's  argument  that  evidentiary 
equipoise as  to  potential  harm  and diversion  is an  insufficient  basis  for 
a  preliminary  injunction  against  enforcement  of  the  Controlled  Sub-
stances  Act.  Given  that  the  Government  conceded  the  UDV's  prima 
facie  RFRA  case  in  the  District  Court  and  that  the  evidence  found  to 
be in equipoise related to an affirmative defense as to which the Govern-
ment  bore  the  burden  of  proof,  the  UDV  effectively  demonstrated  a 
likelihood  of success on the merits.  The Government's argument  that, 
although it would bear the burden of demonstrating a compelling inter-
est  at  trial  on  the  merits,  the  UDV  should  have  borne  the  burden  of 
disproving such interests at the preliminary injunction hearing is fore-
closed  by  Ashcroft  v.  American  Civil  Liberties  Union,  542  U. S.  656, 
666.  There,  in  affirming  the  grant  of  a  preliminary  injunction  against 
the Government, this Court  reasoned that the burdens with respect to 
the  compelling  interest  test  at  the  preliminary  injunction  stage  track 
the  burdens  at  trial.  The  Government's  attempt  to  limit  the  Ashcroft 
rule  to  content-based  restrictions  on  speech  is  unavailing.  The  fact 
that Ashcroft involved such a restriction in no way affected the Court's 
assessment of the consequences of having the burden at trial for prelimi-
nary  injunction  purposes.  Congress'  express  decision  to  legislate  the 
compelling interest test indicates that RFRA challenges should be adju-
dicated in the same way as the test's constitutionally mandated applica-
tions, including at the preliminary injunction stage.  Pp. 427-430. 

2.  Also rejected is the Government's central submission that, because 
it has a compelling interest in the uniform application of the Controlled 
Substances Act, no exception to the DMT ban can be made to accommo-
date the UDV.  The Government  argues, inter  alia, that the  Act's  de-
scription  of  Schedule  I  substances  as  having  "a  high  potential  for 
abuse,"  "no  currently  accepted  medical  use,"  and  "a  lack  of  accepted 
safety for use . . .  under medical supervision," 21 U. S. C. $ 812(b)(1), by 
itself precludes any consideration of individualized exceptions, and that 
the  Act's  "closed"  regulatory  system,  which  prohibits  all  use  of  con-
trolled  substances  except  as  the  Act  itself  authorizes,  see  Gonzales  v. 
Raich,  545  U. S.  1,  13,  cannot  function  properly  if  subjected  to  judicial 
exemptions.  Pp. 430-437.

the Government to demonstrate that the compelling interest test is sat-
isfied  through  application  of  the  challenged  law  "to  the  person"--the 
particular claimant whose sincere exercise of religion is being substan-
tially  burdened.  42  U. S. C.  $ 2000bb-1(b).  Section  2000bb(b)(1)  ex-
pressly  adopted  the  compelling  interest  test  of  Sherbert  v.  Verner,  374 
U. S.  398,  and  Wisconsin  v.  Yoder,  406  U. S.  205.  There,  the  Court 
looked beyond broadly formulated interests justifying the general appli-
cability  of  government  mandates,  scrutinized  the  asserted  harms,  and 
granted  specific  exemptions  to  particular  religious  claimants.  Id.,  at 
213, 221, 236; Sherbert, supra, at 410.  Outside the Free Exercise area 
as  well,  the  Court  has  noted  that  "[c]ontext  matters"  in  applying  the 
compelling  interest  test,  Grutter  v.  Bollinger,  539  U. S.  306,  327,  and 
has  emphasized  that  strict  scrutiny's  fundamental  purpose  is  to  take 
"relevant differences" into account, Adarand Constructors, Inc. v.  Pen~ a, 
515 U. S. 200, 228.  Pp. 430-432. 

(b)  Under  RFRA's  more  focused  inquiry,  the  Government's  mere 
invocation of the general characteristics of Schedule I substances cannot 
carry the day.  Although Schedule I substances such as DMT are excep-
tionally dangerous, see, e. g., Touby v.  United States, 500 U. S. 160, 162, 
there is no indication that Congress, in classifying DMT, considered the 
harms posed by the particular use at issue.  That question was litigated 
below.  Before  the  District  Court  found  that  the  Government  had  not 
carried its  burden of  showing  a compelling  interest in  preventing such 
harm, the court noted that it could not ignore the congressional classifi-
cation and findings.  But Congress' determination that DMT should be 
listed  under  Schedule  I  simply  does  not  provide  a  categorical  answer 
that  relieves  the  Government  of  the  obligation  to  shoulder  its  RFRA 
burden.  The Controlled Substances Act's authorization to the Attorney 
General to "waive the requirement for registration of certain manufac-
turers, distributors, or dispensers if he finds it consistent with the public 
health and safety," 21 U. S. C. $ 822(d), reinforces that Congress' findings 
with respect to  Schedule  I  substances  should not  carry the  determina-
tive weight, for RFRA purposes, that the Government would ascribe to 
them.  Indeed,  despite  the  fact  that  everything  the  Government  says 
about  the DMT in hoasca  applies in equal  measure to the mescaline  in 
peyote, another Schedule I substance, both the Executive and Congress 
have decreed an exception from the Controlled Substances Act for Na-
tive American religious use of peyote, see 21 CFR $ 1307.31; 42 U. S. C. 

$ 1996a(b)(1).  If  such  use  is  permitted  in  the  face  of  the  general  con-
gressional findings for hundreds of thousands of Native Americans prac-
ticing  their  faith,  those  same  findings  alone  cannot  preclude  consider-
ation of a similar exception for the 130 or so American members of the 
UDV who want to practice theirs.  See Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye,

Inc.  v.  Hialeah,  508  U. S.  520,  547.  The  Government's  argument  that 
the existence of a congressional exemption for peyote does not indicate 
that  the  Controlled  Substances  Act  is  amenable  to  judicially  crafted 
exceptions  fails  because  RFRA  plainly  contemplates  court-recognized 
exceptions, see $ 2000bb-1(c).  Pp. 432-434. 

(c)  The peyote exception also fatally undermines the Government's 
broader  contention  that  the  Controlled  Substances  Act  establishes  a 
closed  regulatory  system  that  admits  of  no  exceptions  under  RFRA. 
The peyote exception has been in place since the Controlled Substances 
Act's outset,  and there  is  no evidence that it  has undercut the Govern-
ment's  ability  to  enforce  the  ban  on  peyote  use  by  non-Indians.  The 
Government's reliance on pre-Smith cases asserting a need for uniform-
ity in rejecting claims for religious exemptions under the Free Exercise 
Clause  is  unavailing.  Those  cases  did  not  embrace  the  notion  that  a 
general interest in uniformity justified a substantial burden on religious 
exercise,  but  instead  scrutinized  the  asserted  need  and  explained  why 
the  denied  exemptions  could  not  be  accommodated.  See,  e. g.,  United 
States v.  Lee, 455 U. S. 252, 258, 260.  They show that the Government 
can demonstrate a compelling interest in uniform application of a partic-
ular program by offering evidence that granting the requested religious 
accommodations  would  seriously  compromise  its  ability  to  administer 
the  program.  Here  the  Government's  uniformity  argument  rests  not 
so  much  on  the  particular  statutory  program  at  issue  as  on  slippery 
slope  concerns  that  could  be  invoked  in  response  to  any  RFRA  claim 
for an exception to a generally applicable law, i. e., "if I make an excep-
tion  for  you,  I'll  have  to  make  one  for  everybody,  so  no  exceptions." 
But  RFRA  operates  by  mandating  consideration,  under  the  compel-
ling  interest  test,  of  exceptions  to  "rule[s]  of  general  applicability." 

$ 2000bb-1(a).  Congress'  determination  that  the  legislated  test  is 
"workable . . . for  striking  sensible  balances  between  religious  liberty 
and competing prior  governmental interests,"  $ 2000bb(a)(5), finds sup-
port in Sherbert, supra, at 407, and Cutter v.  Wilkinson, 544 U. S. 709, 
722.  While  there  may  be  instances  where  a  need  for  uniformity  pre-
cludes  the recognition of  exceptions  to generally  applicable  laws  under 
RFRA,  it  would  be  surprising  to  find  that  this  was  such  a  case,  given 
the  longstanding  peyote  exemption  and  the  fact  that  the  very  reason 
Congress enacted RFRA was to respond to a decision denying a claimed 
right  to  sacramental  use  of  a  controlled  substance.  The  Government 
has  not  shown  that  granting  the  UDV  an  exemption  would  cause  the 
kind of administrative harm recognized as a compelling interest in, e. g., 
Lee.  It  cannot  now compensate  for its failure  to convince  the District 
Court as to its health or diversion concerns with the bold argument that

there  can  be  no  RFRA  exceptions  at  all  to  the  Controlled  Substances 
Act.  Pp. 434-437. 

3.  The  Government  argues  unpersuasively  that  it  has  a  compelling 
interest  in  complying  with  the  1971  U.  N.  Convention.  While  this 
Court does not agree with the District Court that the Convention does 
not  cover  hoasca,  that  does  not  automatically  mean  that  the  Govern-
ment has demonstrated a compelling interest in applying the Controlled 
Substances Act, which implements the Convention, to the UDV's sacra-
mental use.  At this stage, it suffices that the Government did not sub-
mit any evidence addressing the international consequences of granting 
the  UDV  an  exemption,  but  simply  relied  on  two  affidavits  by  State 
Department  officials  attesting  to  the  general  (and  undoubted)  impor-
tance  of honoring international obligations and maintaining the United 
States'  leadership  in  the  international  war  on  drugs.  Under  RFRA, 
invocation  of  such  general  interests,  standing  alone,  is  not  enough.

Opinion of the Court 

I 
In  Employment  Div.,  Dept.  of  Human  Resources  of  Ore. v. 

Smith,  494  U. S.  872  (1990),  this  Court  held  that  the  Free Exercise  Clause  of  the  First  Amendment  does  not  prohibit 

governments  from  burdening  religious  practices  through generally  applicable  laws.  In  Smith,  we  rejected  a  chal-
lenge to an Oregon statute that denied unemployment bene-fits  to  drug  users,  including  Native  Americans  engaged  in 
the sacramental use of peyote.  Id., at 890.  In so doing, we rejected  the  interpretation  of  the  Free  Exercise  Clause  an-
nounced  in  Sherbert  v.  Verner,  374  U. S.  398  (1963),  and,  in accord  with  earlier  cases,  see 

Smith,  494  U. S.,  at  879- 880,  884-885,  held  that  the  Constitution  does  not  require 

judges  to  engage  in  a  case-by-case  assessment  of  the  reli-gious  burdens  imposed  by  facially  constitutional  laws.  Id., 
at 883-890. Congress  responded  by  enacting  the  Religious  Freedom 
Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA), 107 Stat. 1488, as amended, 42  U. S. C.  $ 2000bb  et  seq.,  which  adopts  a  statutory  rule 
comparable  to  the  constitutional  rule  rejected  in  Smith. Under RFRA, the Federal Government may not, as a statu-
tory matter, substantially burden a person's exercise of reli-gion,  "even  if  the  burden  results  from  a  rule  of  general  ap-
plicability."  $ 2000bb-1(a).  The  only  exception  recognized by  the  statute  requires  the  Government  to  satisfy  the  com-
pelling  interest  test--to  "demonstrat[e]  that  application  of the  burden  to  the  person--(1)  is  in  furtherance  of  a  compel-
ling  governmental  interest;  and  (2)  is  the  least  restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest." 

$ 2000bb-1(b).  A  person  whose  religious  practices  are  bur-dened  in  violation  of  RFRA  "may  assert  that  violation  as  a 
claim  or  defense  in  a  judicial  proceeding  and  obtain  appro-priate relief."  $ 2000bb-1(c).

Government.  In  City  of  Boerne  v.  Flores,  521  U. S.  507  (1997),  we  held 
the  application  to  States  to  be  beyond  Congress'  legislative  authority 
under $ 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.

Opinion of the Court 
The Controlled Substances Act, 84 Stat. 1242, as amended, 21  U. S. C.  $ 801 

et  seq.  (2000  ed.  and  Supp.  I),  regulates  the 
importation,  manufacture,  distribution,  and  use  of  psycho-tropic  substances.  The  Act  classifies  substances  into  five 

schedules  based  on  their  potential  for  abuse,  the  extent  to which  they  have  an  accepted  medical  use,  and  their  safety. 
See  $ 812(b)  (2000  ed.).  Substances  listed  in  Schedule  I  of 
the  Act  are  subject  to  the  most  comprehensive  restrictions, including an outright ban on all importation and use, except 

pursuant to strictly regulated research projects.  See $$ 823, 960(a)(1).  The  Act  authorizes  the  imposition  of  a  criminal 
sentence for simple possession of Schedule I substances, see $ 844(a),  and mandates  the  imposition  of a  criminal  sentence 
for possession "with intent to manufacture, distribute, or dis-pense" such substances, see $$ 841(a), (b). 

O Centro Espi'rita Beneficente Unia~ o do Vegetal (UDV) is a  Christian  Spiritist  sect  based  in  Brazil,  with  an  American 
branch  of  approximately  130  individuals.  Central  to  the UDV's  faith  is  receiving  communion  through 

hoasca  (pro-
nounced "wass-ca"), a sacramental tea made from two plants 
unique to the Amazon region.  One of the plants, psychotria 
viridis, contains  dimethyltryptamine  (DMT),  a  hallucinogen 
whose effects are enhanced by alkaloids from the other plant, 
banisteriopsis  caapi.  DMT,  as  well  as  "any  material,  com-
pound, mixture, or preparation, which contains any quantity 
of  [DMT],"  is  listed  in  Schedule  I  of  the  Controlled  Sub-
stances Act.  $ 812(c), Schedule I(c). 

In  1999,  United  States  Customs  inspectors  intercepted  a 
shipment  to  the  American  UDV  containing  three  drums  of 
hoasca.  A subsequent investigation revealed that the UDV 
had  received  14  prior  shipments  of  hoasca.  The  inspectors 
seized  the  intercepted  shipment  and  threatened  the  UDV 
with prosecution. 

The  UDV  filed  suit  against  the  Attorney  General  and 
other  federal  law  enforcement  officials,  seeking  declaratory 
and injunctive relief.  The complaint alleged, inter alia, that 
applying the Controlled Substances Act to the UDV's sacra-

Opinion of the Court 

mental  use  of  hoasca  violates  RFRA.  Prior  to  trial,  the UDV  moved  for  a  preliminary  injunction,  so  that  it  could 

continue to practice its faith pending trial on the merits. At  a  hearing  on  the  preliminary  injunction,  the  Govern-
ment  conceded  that  the  challenged  application  of  the  Con-trolled Substances  Act would substantially burden a sincere 
exercise of religion by the UDV.  See O Centro Espirita Be-
neficiente Uniao do Vegetal v.  Ashcroft, 282 F. Supp. 2d 1236, 1252  (NM  2002).  The  Government  argued,  however,  that 

this  burden  did  not  violate  RFRA,  because  applying  the Controlled Substances Act in this case was the least restric-
tive  means  of  advancing  three  compelling  governmental  in-terests:  protecting  the  health  and  safety  of  UDV  members, 
preventing the diversion of hoasca from the church to recre-ational  users,  and  complying  with  the  1971  United  Nations 
Convention  on  Psychotropic  Substances,  a  treaty  signed  by the  United  States  and  implemented  by  the  Act.  Feb.  21, 
1971,  [1979-1980]  32  U. S. T.  543,  T. I. A. S.  No.  9725.  See 282 F. Supp. 2d, at 1252-1253. 

The  District  Court  heard  evidence  from  both  parties  on 
the  health  risks  of  hoasca  and  the  potential  for  diversion from  the  church.  The  Government  presented  evidence  to 

the  effect  that  use  of  hoasca,  or  DMT  more  generally,  can 
cause psychotic reactions, cardiac irregularities, and adverse 
drug  interactions.  The  UDV  countered  by  citing  studies 
documenting the safety of its sacramental use of hoasca and 
presenting  evidence  that  minimized  the  likelihood  of  the 
health risks raised by the Government.  With respect to di-
version,  the  Government  pointed  to  a  general  rise  in  the 
illicit  use  of  hallucinogens,  and  cited  interest  in  the  illegal 
use  of  DMT  and  hoasca  in  particular;  the  UDV  emphasized 
the  thinness  of  any  market  for  hoasca,  the  relatively  small 
amounts  of  the  substance  imported  by  the  church,  and  the 
absence of any diversion problem in the past. 

The  District  Court  concluded  that  the  evidence  on  health 
risks  was  "in  equipoise,"  and  similarly  that  the  evidence  on 
diversion  was  "virtually  balanced."  Id.,  at  1262,  1266.  In

427 Cite as: 546 U. S. 418 (2006) 
Opinion of the Court 
the face of such an even showing, the court reasoned that the 
Government had failed to demonstrate a compelling interest 
justifying what it acknowledged was a substantial burden on 
the  UDV's  sincere  religious  exercise.  Id.,  at  1255.  The 
court  also  rejected  the  asserted  interest  in  complying  with 
the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances, hold-
ing  that  the  Convention  does  not  apply  to  hoasca.  Id.,  at 
1266-1269. 

The court entered a preliminary injunction prohibiting the 
Government  from  enforcing  the  Controlled  Substances  Act 
with  respect  to  the  UDV's  importation  and  use  of  hoasca. 
The  injunction  requires  the  church to  import  the  tea  pursu-
ant  to  federal  permits,  to  restrict  control  over  the  tea  to 
persons of church authority, and to warn particularly suscep-
tible UDV members of the dangers of hoasca.  See Prelimi-
nary  Injunction  |||| 2,  5-12,  32-33,  App.  F  to  App.  to  Pet. 
for  Cert.  249a,  250a-252a,  258a-259a.  The  injunction  also 
provides  that  "if  [the  Government]  believe[s]  that  evidence 
exists that hoasca has negatively affected the health of UDV 
members,"  or "that  a  shipment  of hoasca  contain[s]  particu-
larly dangerous  levels of DMT,  [the  Government]  may apply 
to the Court for an expedite[d] determination of whether the 
evidence  warrants  suspension  or  revocation  of  [the  UDV's 
authority to use hoasca]."  Id., at 257a, || 29. 

The  Government  appealed  the  preliminary  injunction  and 
a  panel  of  the  Court  of  Appeals  for  the  Tenth  Circuit  af-
firmed,  O  Centro  Espirita  Beneficiente  Uniao  do  Vegetal 
v.  Ashcroft,  342  F.  3d  1170  (2003),  as  did  a  majority  of  the 
Circuit  sitting  en  banc,  389  F.  3d  973  (2004).  We  granted 
certiorari.  544 U. S. 973 (2005). 

II 
Although its briefs contain some discussion of the potential 
for  harm  and  diversion  from  the  UDV's  use  of  hoasca,  the 
Government  does  not  challenge  the  District  Court's  factual 
findings  or  its  conclusion  that  the  evidence  submitted  on

UNIAO DO VEGETAL 

Opinion of the Court 

these issues was evenly balanced.  Instead, the Government maintains  that  such  evidentiary  equipoise  is  an  insufficient 

basis  for  issuing  a  preliminary  injunction  against  enforce-ment of the Controlled Substances Act.  We review the Dis-
trict  Court's  legal  rulings  de  novo  and  its  ultimate  decision to  issue  the  preliminary  injunction  for  abuse  of  discretion. 
See McCreary County v.  American Civil Liberties Union of 
Ky., 545 U. S. 844, 867 (2005). The  Government  begins  by  invoking  the  well-established 

principle that the party seeking pretrial relief bears the bur-den  of  demonstrating  a  likelihood  of  success  on  the  merits. 
See,  e. g.,  Mazurek  v.  Armstrong,  520  U. S.  968,  972  (1997) 
(per  curiam);  Doran  v.  Salem  Inn,  Inc.,  422  U. S.  922,  931 
(1975).  The Government argues that the District Court lost 
sight  of  this  principle  in  issuing  the  injunction  based  on  a 
mere tie in the evidentiary record. 

A  majority  of  the  en  banc  Court  of  Appeals  rejected  this 
argument,  and  so  do  we.  Before  the  District  Court,  the 
Government  conceded  the  UDV's  prima  facie  case  under 
RFRA.  See 282 F. Supp. 2d, at 1252 (application of the Con-
trolled  Substances  Act  would  (1)  substantially  burden  (2)  a 
sincere  (3)  religious  exercise).  The  evidence  the  District 
Court found to be in  equipoise related to two of the compel-
ling  interests  asserted  by  the  Government,  which  formed 
part  of  the  Government's  affirmative  defense.  See  42 
U. S. C.  $ 2000bb-1(b)  ("Government  may  substantially  bur-
den  a  person's  exercise  of  religion  only  if  it  demonstrates 
that  application  of  the  burden  to  the  person--(1)  is  in  fur-
therance of a compelling governmental interest . . .  " (empha-
sis added)); $ 2000bb-2(3) ("[T]he term `demonstrates' means 
meets  the  burdens  of  going  forward  with  the  evidence  and 
of  persuasion").  Accordingly,  the  UDV  effectively  demon-
strated that its sincere exercise of religion was substantially 
burdened,  and  the  Government  failed  to  demonstrate  that 
the application of the burden to the UDV would, more likely 
than  not,  be  justified  by  the  asserted  compelling  interests.

Opinion of the Court 
See  389  F.  3d,  at  1009  (Seymour,  J.,  concurring  in  part  and dissenting  in  part)  ("[T]he  balance  is  between  actual  irrep-

arable  harm  to  [the]  plaintiff  and  potential  harm  to  the government  which  does  not  even  rise  to  the  level  of  a  pre-
ponderance of the evidence"). The  Government  argues  that,  although  it  would  bear  the 
burden of demonstrating a  compelling interest as part  of its 
affirmative  defense  at  trial  on  the  merits,  the  UDV  should have borne the burden of disproving the asserted compelling 

interests at the hearing on the preliminary injunction.  This argument  is  foreclosed  by  our  recent  decision  in 

Ashcroft  v. 
American  Civil  Liberties  Union,  542  U. S.  656  (2004).  In 
Ashcroft,  we  affirmed  the  grant  of  a  preliminary  injunction 
in  a  case  where  the  Government  had  failed  to  show  a  likeli-
hood of success under the compelling interest test.  We rea-
soned  that  "[a]s  the  Government  bears  the  burden  of  proof 
on  the  ultimate  question  of  [the  challenged  Act's]  constitu-
tionality,  respondents  [the  movants]  must  be  deemed  likely 
to  prevail  unless  the  Government  has  shown  that  respond-
ents' proposed  less restrictive alternatives are less effective 
than  [enforcing  the  Act]."  Id.,  at  666.  That  logic  extends 
to  this  case;  here  the  Government  failed  on  the  first  prong 
of  the  compelling  interest  test,  and  did  not  reach  the  least 
restrictive  means  prong,  but  that  can  make  no  difference. 
The  point  remains  that  the  burdens  at  the  preliminary  in-
junction stage track the burdens at trial. 

The  Government  attempts  to  limit  the  rule  announced  in 
Ashcroft to content-based restrictions on speech, but the dis-
tinction is unavailing.  The fact that Ashcroft involved such 
a restriction was the reason the Government had the burden 
of proof at trial under the First Amendment, see id., at 665, 
but  in  no  way  affected  the  Court's  assessment  of  the  conse-
quences  of  having  that  burden  for  purposes  of  the  prelimi-
nary injunction.  Here the burden is  placed squarely on the 
Government  by  RFRA  rather  than  the  First  Amendment, 
see  42  U. S. C.  $$ 2000bb-1(b),  2000bb-2(3),  but  the  conse-

Opinion of the Court 

quences  are  the  same.  Congress's  express  decision  to  leg-islate  the  compelling  interest  test  indicates  that  RFRA 

challenges  should  be  adjudicated  in  the  same  manner  as constitutionally  mandated  applications  of  the  test,  including 

at the preliminary injunction stage. 

III 
The  Government's  second  line  of  argument  rests  on  the Controlled  Substances  Act  itself.  The  Government  con-

tends  that  the  Act's  description  of  Schedule  I  substances  as having  "a  high  potential  for  abuse,"  "no  currently  accepted 
medical  use  in  treatment  in  the  United  States,"  and  "a  lack of accepted safety for use . . . under medical supervision," 21 
U. S. C.  $ 812(b)(1),  by  itself  precludes  any  consideration  of individualized  exceptions  such  as  that  sought  by  the  UDV. 
The  Government  goes  on  to  argue  that  the  regulatory  re-gime established by the Act--a "closed" system that prohib-
its  all  use  of  controlled  substances  except  as  authorized  by the Act itself, see Gonzales v.  Raich, 545 U. S. 1, 13 (2005)-- 
"cannot function with its necessary rigor and comprehensive-ness if subjected to judicial exemptions."  Brief for Petition-
ers  18.  According  to  the  Government,  there  would  be  no way  to  cabin  religious  exceptions  once  recognized,  and  "the 
public  will  misread"  such  exceptions  as  signaling  that  the substance  at  issue  is  not  harmful  after  all. 

Id.,  at  23. Under the Government's view, there is no need to assess the 

particulars  of  the  UDV's  use  or  weigh  the  impact  of  an  ex-emption  for  that  specific  use,  because  the  Controlled  Sub-
stances  Act  serves  a  compelling  purpose  and  simply  admits of no exceptions. 

A 
RFRA, and the strict scrutiny test it adopted, contemplate an  inquiry  more  focused  than  the  Government's  categorical 

approach.  RFRA requires the Government to demonstrate that the compelling interest test is satisfied through applica-
tion  of  the  challenged  law  "to  the  person"--the  particular

claimant  whose  sincere  exercise  of  religion  is  being  sub-stantially  burdened.  42  U. S. C.  $ 2000bb-1(b).  RFRA  ex-

pressly  adopted the  compelling interest  test  "as  set  forth  in 
Sherbert  v.  Verner,  374  U. S.  398  (1963)  and  Wisconsin  v. 
Yoder,  406  U. S.  205  (1972)."  $ 2000bb(b)(1).  In  each  of those cases, this Court looked beyond broadly formulated in-

terests  justifying  the  general  applicability  of  government 
mandates and scrutinized the asserted harm of granting spe-cific exemptions to particular religious claimants.  In 

Yoder, 
for example, we permitted an exemption  for Amish children from  a  compulsory  school  attendance  law.  We  recognized 

that  the  State  had  a  "paramount"  interest  in  education,  but 
held  that  "despite  its  admitted  validity  in  the  generality  of 
cases,  we  must  searchingly  examine  the  interests  that  the 
State  seeks  to  promote  .  .  .  and  the  impediment  to  those 
objectives  that  would  flow  from  recognizing  the  claimed 
Amish exemption."  406 U. S., at 213, 221 (emphasis added). 
The  Court  explained  that  the  State  needed  "to  show  with 
more  particularity  how  its  admittedly  strong  interest  .  .  . 
would be adversely affected by granting an exemption to the 
Amish."  Id., at 236 (emphasis added). 

In  Sherbert,  the Court  upheld  a  particular  claim to  a  reli-
gious  exemption  from  a  state  law  denying  unemployment 
benefits  to  those who would  not  work on Saturdays,  but ex-
plained  that  it  was  not  announcing  a  constitutional  right  to 
unemployment benefits for "all persons whose religious con-
victions are the cause of their unemployment."  374 U. S., at 
410 (emphasis added).  The Court distinguished the case "in 
which an employee's religious convictions serve to make him 
a  nonproductive  member  of society."  Ibid.;  see  also  Smith, 
494 U. S., at 899 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment) (strict 
scrutiny  "at  least  requires  a  case-by-case  determination  of 
the question, sensitive to the facts of each particular claim"). 
Outside the Free Exercise area as well, the Court has noted 
that  "[c]ontext  matters"  in  applying  the  compelling  interest 
test,  Grutter v.  Bollinger,  539  U. S.  306,  327  (2003),  and  has

emphasized  that  "strict  scrutiny  does  take  `relevant  differ-ences'  into  account--indeed,  that  is  its  fundamental  pur-

pose,"  Adarand  Constructors,  Inc.  v.  Pen~ a,  515  U. S.  200, 228 (1995). 

B 
Under  the  more  focused  inquiry  required  by  RFRA  and the  compelling interest test,  the  Government's  mere invoca-

tion  of  the  general  characteristics  of  Schedule  I  substances, as  set  forth  in  the  Controlled  Substances  Act,  cannot  carry 
the  day.  It  is  true,  of  course,  that  Schedule  I  substances such as DMT are exceptionally dangerous.  See, 

e. g., Touby v. 
United  States,  500  U. S.  160,  162  (1991).  Nevertheless, there is no indication that Congress, in classifying DMT, con-

sidered the harms posed by the particular use at issue here-- the  circumscribed,  sacramental  use  of  hoasca  by  the  UDV. 
The  question  of  the  harms  from  the  sacramental  use  of hoasca  by  the  UDV  was  litigated  below.  Before  the  Dis-
trict  Court  found  that  the  Government  had  not  carried  its burden  of  showing  a  compelling  interest  in  preventing  such 
harms,  the  court  noted  that  it  could  not  "ignore  that  the legislative branch of the government elected to place materi-
als  containing  DMT  in  Schedule  I  of  the  [Act],  reflecting findings that substances containing DMT have `a high poten-
tial  for  abuse,'  and  `no  currently  accepted  medical  use  in treatment in the United States,' and that `[t]here is a lack of 
accepted  safety  for  use  of  [DMT]  under  medical  supervi-sion.' "  282 F. Supp. 2d, at 1254.  But Congress' determina-
tion that DMT should be listed under Schedule I simply does not  provide  a  categorical  answer  that  relieves  the  Govern-
ment  of  the  obligation  to  shoulder  its  burden  under  RFRA. This conclusion is reinforced by the Controlled Substances 
Act itself.  The Act contains a provision authorizing the At-torney General to "waive the requirement for registration of 
certain manufacturers, distributors, or dispensers if he finds it  consistent  with  the  public  health  and  safety."  21  U. S. C. 

$ 822(d).  The  fact  that  the  Act  itself  contemplates  that  ex-

Opinion of the Court 
empting certain people from its requirements would be "con-sistent with the public health and safety" indicates that con-

gressional  findings  with  respect  to  Schedule  I  substances should  not  carry  the  determinative  weight,  for  RFRA  pur-
poses, that the Government would ascribe to them. And in fact an exception has been made to the Schedule I 
ban for religious use.  For the past 35 years, there has been 
a regulatory exemption for use of peyote--a Schedule I sub-stance--by  the  Native  American  Church.  See  21  CFR 

$ 1307.31  (2005).  In  1994,  Congress  extended  that  exemp-tion  to  all  members  of  every  recognized  Indian  Tribe.  See 
42  U. S. C.  $ 1996a(b)(1).  Everything  the  Government  says 
about  the  DMT  in  hoasca--that,  as  a  Schedule  I  substance, 
Congress  has  determined  that  it  "has  a  high  potential  for 
abuse,"  "has  no  currently  accepted  medical  use,"  and  has 
"a lack of accepted safety for use . . . under medical supervi-
sion," 21 U. S. C. $ 812(b)(1)--applies in equal measure to the 
mescaline  in  peyote,  yet  both  the  Executive  and  Congress 
itself  have  decreed  an  exception  from  the  Controlled  Sub-
stances Act for Native American religious use of peyote.  If 
such use is permitted in the face of the congressional findings 
in $ 812(b)(1) for hundreds of thousands of Native Americans 
practicing  their  faith,  it  is  difficult  to  see  how  those  same 
findings alone can preclude any consideration of a similar ex-
ception for the 130 or so American members of the UDV who 
want  to  practice  theirs.  See  Church  of  Lukumi  Babalu 
Aye,  Inc.  v.  Hialeah,  508  U. S.  520,  547  (1993)  ("It  is  estab-
lished in our strict scrutiny jurisprudence that `a law cannot 
be  regarded  as  protecting  an  interest  `of  the  highest 
order' . . .  when it leaves appreciable damage to that suppos-
edly  vital  interest  unprohibited' "  (quoting  Florida  Star  v. 
B.  J.  F.,  491  U. S. 524, 541-542  (1989) (Scalia,

Opinion of the Court 

but never explains what about that "unique" relationship jus-tifies  overriding  the  same  congressional  findings  on  which 

the  Government  relies  in  resisting  any  exception  for  the UDV's  religious  use  of  hoasca.  In  other  words,  if  any 
Schedule  I  substance  is  in  fact  always  highly  dangerous  in any amount no matter how used, what about the unique rela-
tionship  with  the  Tribes  justifies  allowing  their  use  of  pey-ote?  Nothing about the unique political status of the Tribes 
makes  their  members  immune  from  the  health  risks  the Government  asserts  accompany  any  use  of  a  Schedule  I 
substance, nor insulates the Schedule I substance the Tribes use  in  religious  exercise  from  the  alleged  risk  of  diversion. 

The  Government  argues  that  the  existence  of  a  congres-
sional exemption for peyote  does not  indicate that the Con-trolled  Substances  Act  is  amenable to  judicially crafted  ex-

ceptions.  RFRA, however, plainly contemplates that courts would  recognize  exceptions--that  is  how  the  law  works. 
See  42  U. S. C.  $ 2000bb-1(c)  ("A  person  whose  religious exercise  has  been  burdened  in  violation  of  this  section 
may  assert  that  violation  as  a  claim  or  defense  in  a  judicial proceeding  and  obtain  appropriate  relief  against  a  govern-
ment").  Congress'  role  in  the  peyote  exemption--and  the Executive's,  see  21  CFR  $ 1307.31  (2005)--confirms  that  the 
findings  in  the  Controlled  Substances  Act  do  not  preclude exceptions  altogether;  RFRA  makes  clear  that  it  is  the  ob-
ligation  of  the  courts  to  consider  whether  exceptions  are required under the test set forth by Congress. 

C 
The  well-established  peyote  exception  also  fatally  under-mines  the  Government's  broader  contention  that  the  Con-

trolled Substances Act  establishes a  closed regulatory system  that  admits  of  no  exceptions  under  RFRA.  The 
Government  argues  that  the  effectiveness  of  the  Controlled Substances Act will be "necessarily . . . undercut" if the Act 
is  not  uniformly  applied,  without  regard  to  burdens  on  reli-gious exercise.  Brief for Petitioners 18.  The peyote excep-

Opinion of the Court 
tion, however, has been in place since the outset of the Con-trolled  Substances  Act,  and  there  is  no  evidence  that  it  has 

"undercut"  the  Government's  ability  to  enforce  the  ban  on peyote use by non-Indians. 

The  Government  points  to  some  pre-Smith  cases  relying on a need for uniformity in rejecting claims for religious ex-
emptions under the Free Exercise Clause, see Brief for Peti-
tioners  16,  but  those  cases  strike  us  as  quite  different  from the  present  one.  Those  cases  did  not  embrace  the  notion 

that  a  general  interest  in  uniformity  justified  a  substantial burden on religious exercise; they instead scrutinized the as-
serted need and explained why the denied exemptions could not be accommodated.  In 

United States v.  Lee, 455 U. S. 252 
(1982),  for  example,  the  Court  rejected  a  claimed  exception to  the  obligation  to  pay  Social  Security  taxes,  noting  that 

"mandatory  participation  is  indispensable  to  the  fiscal  vital-ity  of  the  social  security  system"  and  that  the  "tax  system 
could  not  function  if  denominations  were  allowed  to  chal-lenge the  tax  system  because  tax  payments  were spent  in  a 
manner that violates their religious belief."  Id., at 258, 260. 
See  also  Hernandez  v.  Commissioner,  490  U. S.  680,  700 (1989)  (same).  In 

Braunfeld  v.  Brown,  366  U. S.  599  (1961) 
(plurality  opinion),  the  Court  denied  a  claimed  exception  to 
Sunday  closing  laws,  in  part  because  allowing  such  excep-
tions  "might  well  provide  [the  claimants]  with  an  economic 
advantage over their competitors who must remain closed on 
that  day."  Id.,  at  608-609.  The  whole  point  of  a  "uniform 
day  of  rest  for  all  workers"  would  have  been  defeated  by 
exceptions.  See  Sherbert,  374  U. S.,  at  408  (discussing 
Braunfeld).  These  cases  show  that  the  Government  can 
demonstrate  a  compelling  interest  in  uniform  application  of 
a  particular  program  by  offering  evidence  that  granting  the 
requested  religious  accommodations  would  seriously  com-
promise its ability to administer the program. 

Here  the  Government's  argument  for  uniformity  is  differ-
ent; it rests not so much on the particular statutory program 
at  issue  as  on  slippery-slope  concerns  that  could  be  invoked

Opinion of the Court 

in response to any RFRA claim for an exception to a gener-ally applicable law.  The Government's argument echoes the 

classic  rejoinder  of  bureaucrats  throughout  history:  If  I make  an  exception  for  you,  I'll  have  to  make  one  for  every-
body,  so  no  exceptions.  But  RFRA  operates  by  mandating consideration,  under  the  compelling  interest  test,  of  ex-
ceptions  to  "rule[s]  of  general  applicability."  42  U. S. C. 

$ 2000bb-1(a).  Congress determined that the legislated test "is  a  workable  test  for  striking  sensible  balances  between 

religious  liberty  and  competing  prior  governmental  inter-ests."  $ 2000bb(a)(5).  This  determination  finds  support  in 
our  cases;  in  Sherbert,  for  example,  we  rejected  a  slippery-slope  argument  similar  to  the  one  offered  in  this  case,  dis-
missing  as  "no  more  than  a  possibility"  the  State's  specula-tion  "that  the  filing  of  fraudulent  claims  by  unscrupulous 
claimants  feigning  religious  objections  to  Saturday  work" would  drain  the  unemployment  benefits  fund.  374  U. S., 
at 407. We reaffirmed just last Term the feasibility of case-by-case 
consideration of religious exemptions to generally applicable 
rules.  In Cutter v.  Wilkinson, 544 U. S. 709 (2005), we held that  the  Religious  Land  Use  and  Institutionalized  Persons 

Act of 2000, which allows federal and state prisoners to seek 
religious  accommodations  pursuant  to  the  same  standard 
as  set  forth  in  RFRA,  does  not  violate  the  Establishment 
Clause.  We  had  "no  cause  to  believe"  that  the  compelling 
interest  test  "would  not  be  applied  in  an  appropriately  bal-
anced  way"  to  specific  claims  for  exemptions  as  they  arose. 
Id.,  at  722.  Nothing  in  our  opinion  suggested  that  courts 
were not up to the task. 

We  do  not  doubt  that  there  may  be  instances  in  which  a 
need  for  uniformity  precludes  the  recognition  of  exceptions 
to  generally  applicable  laws  under  RFRA.  But  it  would 
have been surprising to find that this was such a case, given 
the  longstanding exemption from  the Controlled  Substances 
Act  for  religious  use  of  peyote,  and  the  fact  that  the  very 
reason Congress enacted RFRA was to respond to a decision

Opinion of the Court 
denying  a  claimed  right  to  sacramental  use  of  a  controlled substance.  See  42  U. S. C.  $ 2000bb(a)(4).  And  in  fact  the 

Government  has  not  offered  evidence  demonstrating  that granting  the  UDV  an  exemption  would  cause  the  kind  of 
administrative  harm  recognized  as  a  compelling  interest  in Lee, Hernandez, and Braunfeld.  The Government failed to 
convince  the  District  Court  at  the  preliminary  injunction hearing  that  health  or  diversion  concerns  provide  a  com-
pelling  interest  in  banning  the  UDV's  sacramental  use  of 
hoasca.  It cannot compensate for that failure now with the bold argument  that there can be no RFRA exceptions at all 

to  the  Controlled  Substances  Act.  See  Tr.  of  Oral  Arg.  17 (Deputy Solicitor General statement that exception could not 
be  made  even  for  "rigorously  policed"  use  of  "one  drop"  of substance "once a year"). 

IV 
Before  the  District  Court,  the  Government  also  asserted an interest in compliance with the 1971 United Nations Con-

vention  on  Psychotropic  Substances,  Feb.  21,  1971,  [1979- 1980]  32  U. S. T.  543,  T. I. A. S.  No.  9725.  The  Convention, 
signed  by  the  United  States  and  implemented  by  the  Con-trolled  Substances  Act,  calls  on  signatories  to  prohibit  the 
use  of  hallucinogens,  including  DMT.  The  Government  ar-gues that it has a compelling interest in meeting its interna-
tional obligations by complying with the Convention. The District Court  rejected  this  interest because  it  found 
that  the  Convention  does  not  cover  hoasca.  The  court  re-lied  on  the  official  commentary  to  the  Convention,  which 
notes  that  "Schedule  I  [of  the  Convention]  does  not  list  .  .  . natural  hallucinogenic  materials,"  and  that  "[p]lants  as  such 
are not, and--it is submitted--are also not likely to be, listed in Schedule I, but only some products obtained from plants." 
U.  N.  Commentary  on  the  Convention  on  Psychotropic  Sub-stances  387,  385  (1976).  The  court  reasoned  that  hoasca, 
like  the  plants  from  which  the  tea  is  made,  is  sufficiently distinct  from  DMT  itself  to  fall  outside  the  treaty.  See  282 
F. Supp. 2d, at 1266-1269.

UNIAO DO VEGETAL 

Opinion of the Court 

We do not agree.  The Convention provides that "a prepa-ration is subject to the same measures of control as the psy-

chotropic substance which it contains," and defines "prepara-tion" as "any solution or mixture, in whatever physical state, 
containing  one  or  more  psychotropic  substances."  See  32 U. S. T.,  at  546,  Art.  1(f)(i);  id.,  at  551,  Art.  3.  Hoasca  is  a 
"solution  or  mixture"  containing  DMT;  the  fact  that  it  is made  by  the  simple  process  of  brewing  plants  in  water,  as 
opposed  to  some  more  advanced  method,  does  not  change that.  To  the  extent  the commentary  suggests  plants  them-
selves  are  not  covered  by  the  Convention,  that  is  of  no  mo-ment--the UDV seeks to import and use a tea brewed from 
plants,  not  the  plants  themselves,  and  the  tea  plainly  quali-fies as a "preparation" under the Convention. 

The  fact  that  hoasca  is  covered  by  the  Convention,  how-ever,  does  not  automatically  mean  that  the  Government  has 
demonstrated  a  compelling  interest  in  applying  the  Con-trolled Substances Act, which implements the Convention, to 
the UDV's sacramental use of the tea.  At the present stage, it suffices to observe that the Government did not even sub-
mit  evidence  addressing  the  international  consequences  of granting an exemption for the UDV.  The Government sim-
ply  submitted  two  affidavits  by  State  Department  officials attesting to the general importance of honoring international 
obligations and of maintaining the  leadership position of the United States in the international war on drugs.  See Decla-
ration of Gary T. Sheridan (Jan. 24, 2001), App. G to App. to Pet. for Cert. 261a; Declaration of Robert E. Dalton (Jan. 24, 
2001), App. H, id., at 265a.  We do not doubt the  validity of these interests, any more than we doubt the general interest 
in  promoting public  health  and safety by enforcing  the  Con-trolled  Substances  Act,  but  under  RFRA  invocation  of  such 
general interests, standing alone, is not enough.2 

2 In  light  of  the  foregoing,  we  do  not  reach  the  UDV's  argument  that 
Art. 22, || 5, of the Convention should be read to accommodate exceptions 
under domestic laws such as RFRA.

Opinion of the Court 

* * * 
The  Government  repeatedly  invokes  Congress'  findings and purposes underlying the Controlled Substances Act, but 

Congress  had  a  reason  for  enacting  RFRA,  too.  Congress recognized  that  "laws  `neutral'  toward  religion  may  burden 
religious  exercise  as  surely  as  laws  intended  to  interfere with  religious  exercise,"  and  legislated  "the  compelling  in-
terest  test"  as  the  means  for  the  courts  to  "strik[e]  sensible balances between religious liberty and competing prior gov-
ernmental interests."  42 U. S. C. $$ 2000bb(a)(2), (5). We  have  no  cause  to  pretend  that  the  task  assigned  by 
Congress to the courts under RFRA is an easy one.  Indeed, the  very  sort  of  difficulties  highlighted  by  the  Government 
here  were cited  by  this  Court  in deciding  that the  approach later  mandated  by  Congress  under RFRA  was  not  required 
as  a  matter  of  constitutional  law  under  the  Free  Exercise Clause.  See  Smith,  494  U. S.,  at  885-890.  But  Congress 
has  determined  that  courts  should  strike  sensible  balances, pursuant to a compelling interest test that requires the Gov-
ernment to address the particular practice at issue.  Apply-ing  that  test,  we  conclude  that  the  courts  below  did  not  err 
in  determining  that  the  Government  failed  to  demonstrate, at the  preliminary  injunction stage,  a compelling interest  in 
barring the UDV's sacramental use of hoasca. The  judgment  of  the  United  States  Court  of  Appeals  for 
the  Tenth  Circuit  is  affirmed,  and  the  case  is  remanded  for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. 

It is so ordered.

Opinion of the Court 
U. S. C.  $ 1981(a).  The  statute  currently  defines  "make  and 
enforce  contracts"  to  "includ[e]  the  making,  performance, 
modification,  and  termination  of  contracts,  and  the  enjoy-
ment  of  all  benefits,  privileges,  terms,  and  conditions  of  the 
contractual relationship."  $ 1981(b). 

McDonald  argues  that  the  statute  must  be  read  to  give 
him  a  cause  of  action  because  he  "made  and  enforced  con-
tracts"  for JWM.  On  his  reading of the  text,  "[i]f Domino's 
refused  to  deal  with  the  salesman  for  a  pepperoni  manufac-
turer because the salesman was black, that would violate the 
section  1981  right  of  the  salesman  to  make  a  contract  on 
behalf  of  his  principal."  Brief  for  Respondent  12.  We 
think not.  The right to "make contracts" guaranteed by the 
statute was not the  insignificant right  to act  as an  agent for 
someone  else's  contracting--any  more  than  it  was the  insig-
nificant right  to act as  amanuensis in writing  out  the  agree-
ment,  and  thus  to  "make"  the  contract  in  that  sense. 
Rather, it was the right--denied in some States to blacks, as 
it was denied at common law to children--to give and receive

ing immunity as to claims of mail damage or delay covered by postal  registration  and  insurance.  While  the  Government 

suggests  other  injuries  falling  outside  the  FTCA  are  also subject  to  administrative  relief,  even  assuming  that  is  true, 
the  provision  the  Government  cites  permits  only  discretion-ary  relief,  not  an  automatic  remedy  like  postal  insurance. 
See  39  U. S. C.  $ 2603  (indicating  the  Postal  Service  "may 
adjust  and  settle"  personal-injury  and  property-damage claims "not cognizable" under the FTCA's administrative re-

lief  provision);  see  also  31  U. S. C.  $ 224c  (1940  ed.)  (indicat-ing  that  "[w]hen  any  damage  is  done  to  person  or  property 
by  or  through  the  operation  of  the  Post  Office  Depart-

though  recognizing  the  unfairness  and  waste  of  judicial  resources  that 
granting  the  motion  would  entail,  the  District  Court,  citing  Federal 
Rule  12(h)(3),  considered  itself  obliged  to  do  so  because it  believed  the 
15-or-more-employees  requirement  to  be  jurisdictional.  It  therefore 
vacated  its  prior  judgment  and  dismissed  Arbaugh's  Title  VII  claim 
with  prejudice  and  her  state-law  claims  without  prejudice.  The  Fifth 
Circuit  affirmed  based  on  its  precedent  holding  that  unless  the 
employee-numerosity  requirement  is  met,  federal-court  subject-matter 
jurisdiction does not exist.

Discovery  ensued.  The  dispute  over  the  employee  count 
turned  on  the  employment  status  of  Y&H's  eight  drivers, 
engaged to make deliveries for the restaurant, and the com-
pany's  four  owners  (the  Moonlight  Cafe's  two  managers  and 
their  shareholder  spouses).  As  the  trial  court  noted,  "[i]f 
either  the  delivery  drivers  or  the  four  owners  are  counted 
with  the  persons  shown  on  the  payroll  journals,  then  Y&H 
employed  fifteen  or  more  persons  for  the  requisite  time." 
App. to Pet. for Cert. 27.  After reviewing the parties' sub-
missions, however, the trial court concluded that neither the 
delivery  drivers  nor  the  owner-managers  nor  their  share-
holder  spouses  qualified  as  "employees"  for  Title  VII  pur-
poses.  Id.,

Opinion in Chambers 
Foundation--brought suit in district court, alleging that the 
nondisclosure  provision  set  forth  in  18  U. S. C.  $ 2709(c)  vio-
lates  their  First  Amendment  right  to  freedom  of  speech. 
The District Court granted the applicants' motion for a pre-
liminary  injunction  against  enforcement  of  $ 2709(c).  A 
panel of the Second Circuit granted the Government's motion 
to  stay  the  District  Court's  judgment  pending  an  expedited 
appeal.  The  same  panel  denied  the  applicants'  subsequent 
motion  to vacate  the  stay in light of changed circumstances. 
In view of the character of the constitutional issue presented 
and the expedited schedule ordered by the Court of Appeals, 
I  deny  the  application  and  grant  the  parties'  accompanying 
motions for leave to file under seal. 

Section  2709, as amended by  the  Uniting and Strengthen-
ing  America  by  Providing  Appropriate  Tools  Required  to 
Intercept  and  Obstruct  Terrorism  Act  of  2001  (hereinafter 
Patriot Act), authorizes the Federal Bureau of Investigation 
(FBI)  to  "request  the  name,  address,  length  of  service,  and 
local and long distance toll billing records of a person or en-
tity"  if  the  FBI  asserts  in  writing  that  the  information 
sought is  "relevant to an  authorized investigation  to protect 
against  international  terrorism  or  clandestine  intelligence 
activities  .  .  .  ."  18  U. S. C.  $ 2709(b)  (2000  ed.,  Supp.  II). 
The  provision  authorizes  the  FBI  to  issue  such  requests  to 
"electronic communication service provider[s]."  $ 2709(a) 
(2000  ed.).  In  this  case,  the  FBI  requested  information 
under  this  section  in  the  form  of  a  "National  Security  Let-
ter" (NSL).  At issue in this case is $ 2709(c), which prohib-
its  the  recipient  of  an  NSL  from  disclosing  that  fact.  Ibid.

"Although there is a question as to the likelihood of [the Government's] success on the merits and some injury to 

[the  applicants]  if  a  stay  is  granted,  the  [Government has]  demonstrated  that  [it]  will  suffer  irreparable  harm 
and the public interest [will be] significantly injured if a stay is not granted.  The balance of harms tilts in favor 
of [the Government].  Mohammed

this case--a  provision of an Act of Congress.  A decision of that  moment  warrants  cautious  review.  Further,  the  Gov-

ernment  points  out  that  the  redacted  version  of  the  com-plaint, prepared in consultation with the Government, identi-
fies  Doe  as  a  member  of  the  American  Library  Association. "The  American  Library  Association,"  the  Government  foot-
notes, "lobbies Congress on behalf of its members and is free to  note  that  one  of  those  members  has  been  served  with  an 
NSL."  Memorandum in Opposition 26, n. 2. In sum, the applicants have not shown cause so extraordi-
nary as to justify this Court's intervention in advance of the expeditious  determination  of  the  merits  toward  which  the 
Second Circuit is swiftly proceeding.

Corp.  v.  Saudi  Basic  Industries  Corp.,  544  U. S.  280,  284--does  not  bar 
actions by nonparties to earlier state-court judgment  simply because, for 
preclusion law purposes, they could be considered in privity with a party 
to that judgment.  Lance v. Dennis, p. 459. 

3.  Removal--Diversity of citizenship.--Defendants may remove an ac-
tion  from  state  to  federal  court  based  on  diversity  of  citizenship  if  there 
is  complete  diversity  between  all  named  plaintiffs  and  all  named  defend-
ants  and  no  defendant  is  a  citizen  of  forum  State;  it  is  not  incumbent 
on  named  defendants  to  negate  existence  of  a  potential  defendant  whose 
presence  in  action  would  destroy  diversity.  Lincoln  Property  Co.  v.
