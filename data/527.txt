CASES ADJUDGED

IN THE

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

AT
OCTOBER TERM, 1998

NEDER v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eleventh circuit

No. 97-1985. Argued February 23, 1999--Decided June 10, 1999
Petitioner Neder was convicted of filing false federal income tax returns

and of federal mail fraud, wire fraud, and bank fraud. At trial, the
District Court determined that materiality with regard to the tax and
bank fraud charges was not a question for the jury and found that the
evidence established that element. The court did not include materiality as an element of either the mail fraud or wire fraud charges. The
Eleventh Circuit affirmed. It held that the District Court's failure to
submit the materiality element of the tax offense to the jury was error
under United States v. Gaudin, 515 U. S. 506, but that the error was
subject to harmless-error analysis and was harmless because materiality
was not in dispute and thus the error did not contribute to the verdict.
The court also held that materiality is not an element of a "scheme or
artifice to defraud" under the mail fraud, wire fraud, and bank fraud
statutes, 18 U. S. C. $$ 1341, 1343, 1344, and thus the District Court did
not err in failing to submit materiality to the jury.

Held:

1. The harmless-error rule of Chapman v. California, 386 U. S. 18,
applies to a jury instruction that omits an element of an offense.
Pp. 7-20.

(a) A limited class of fundamental constitutional errors is so intrinsically harmful as to require automatic reversal without regard to their
effect on a trial's outcome. Such errors infect the entire trial process
and necessarily render a trial fundamentally unfair. For all other con1

2 NEDER v. UNITED STATES

Syllabus
stitutional errors, reviewing courts must apply harmless-error analysis.
An instruction that omits an element of the offense differs markedly
from the constitutional violations this Court has found to defy
harmless-error review, for it does not necessarily render a trial fundamentally unfair or an unreliable vehicle for determining guilt or innocence. Omitting an element can easily be analogized to improperly

instructing the jury on the element, an error that is subject to
harmless-error analysis, Johnson v. United States, 520 U. S. 461, 469.
The conclusion reached here is consistent with Sullivan v. Louisiana,
508 U. S. 275, on which Neder principally relies. The strand of Sullivan's reasoning that supports his position that harmless-error review is
precluded where a constitutional error prevents a jury from rendering
a "complete verdict" on every element of an offense cannot be squared
with the cases in which this Court has applied harmless-error analysis
to instructional errors, see, e. g., Pope v. Illinois, 481 U. S. 497. The
restrictive approach that Neder gleaned from Connecticut v. Johnson,
460 U. S. 73, a concurring opinion in Carella v. California, 491 U. S.
263, and language in Sullivan--under which an instructional omission,
misdescription, or conclusive presumption can be subject to harmlesserror analysis only in three rare situations--is also mistaken. Neder
underreported $5 million on his tax returns, failed to contest materiality
at trial, and does not suggest that he would introduce any evidence
bearing upon that issue if so allowed. Reversal without consideration
of the error's effect upon the verdict would send the case back for retrial focused not on materiality but on contested issues on which the
jury was properly charged. The Sixth Amendment does not require
the Court to veer away from settled precedent to reach such a result.
Pp. 8-15.

(b) The District Court's failure to submit the tax offense's materiality element to the jury was harmless error. A constitutional error is
harmless when it appears "beyond a reasonable doubt that the error . . .
did not contribute to the verdict obtained." Chapman v. California,
supra, at 24. No jury could find that Neder's failure to report substantial income on his tax returns was not material. The evidence was so
overwhelming that he did not even contest that issue. Where, as here,
a reviewing court concludes beyond a reasonable doubt that the omitted
element was uncontested and supported by overwhelming evidence,
such that the jury verdict would have been the same absent the error,
the erroneous instruction is properly found to be harmless. Neder's
dispute of this conclusion is simply another form of the argument that
the failure to instruct on any element of the crime is not subject to
harmless-error analysis. The harmless-error inquiry in this case must
be essentially the same as the analysis used in other cases that deal

Syllabus
with errors infringing upon the jury's factfinding role and affecting its
deliberative process in ways that are not readily calculable: Is it clear
beyond a reasonable doubt that a rational jury would have found the
defendant guilty absent the error? See, e. g., Arizona v. Fulminante,
499 U. S. 279. Where an omitted element is supported by uncontroverted evidence, this approach appropriately balances "society's interest
in punishing the guilty . . . and the method by which decisions of guilt
are made." Connecticut v. Johnson, supra, at 86. Pp. 15-20.

2. Materiality is an element of a "scheme or artifice to defraud" under
the federal mail fraud, wire fraud, and bank fraud statutes. Pp. 20-25.

(a) Under the framework set forth in United States v. Wells, 519
U. S. 482, the first step is to examine the statutes' text. The statutes
neither define "scheme or artifice to defraud" nor even mention materiality. Thus, based solely on a reading of the text, materiality would not
be an element of these statutes. However, a necessary second step in
interpreting statutory language provides that " `[w]here Congress uses
terms that have accumulated settled meaning under . . . the common
law, a court must infer, unless the statute otherwise dictates, that Congress means to incorporate the established meaning of these terms.' "
Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Darden, 503 U. S. 318, 322. At the time of
the mail fraud statute's enactment in 1872 and the later enactments of
the wire fraud and bank fraud statutes, the well-settled, common-law
meaning of "fraud" required a misrepresentation or concealment of material fact. Thus, this Court cannot infer from the absence of a specific
reference to materiality that Congress intended to drop that element
from the fraud statutes and must presume that Congress intended to
incorporate materiality unless the statutes otherwise dictate. Contrary to the Government's position, the fact that the fraud statutes
sweep more broadly than the common-law crime "false pretenses" does
not rebut the presumption that Congress intended to limit criminal liability to conduct that would constitute common-law fraud. Durland v.
United States, 161 U. S. 306, distinguished. Nor has the Government
shown that the language of the fraud statutes is inconsistent with a
materiality requirement. Pp. 20-25.

(b) The Court of Appeals is to determine in the first instance
whether the jury-instruction error was, in fact, harmless. Carella v.
California, supra, at 266-267. P. 25.

136 F. 3d 1459, affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.

Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of theCourt.

Petitioner was tried on charges of violating a number offederal criminal statutes penalizing fraud. It is agreed that
the District Court erred in refusing to submit the issue ofmateriality to the jury with respect to those charges involving tax fraud. See United States v. Gaudin, 515 U. S. 506(1995). We hold that the harmless-error rule of Chapman
v. California, 386 U. S. 18 (1967), applies to this error. Wealso hold that materiality is an element of the federal mail
fraud, wire fraud, and bank fraud statutes under which peti-tioner was also charged.

I
In the mid-1980's, petitioner Ellis E. Neder, Jr., an attor-ney and real estate developer in Jacksonville, Florida, engaged in a number of real estate transactions financed byfraudulently obtained bank loans. Between 1984 and 1986,
Neder purchased 12 parcels of land using shell corporationsset up by his attorneys and then immediately resold the land
at much higher prices to limited partnerships that he con*Briefs of amici curiae urging reversal were filed for the American

Opinion of the Court
trolled. Using inflated appraisals, Neder secured bank loans
that typically amounted to 70% to 75% of the inflated resale
price of the land. In so doing, he concealed from lenders
that he controlled the shell corporations, that he had purchased the land at prices substantially lower than the inflated resale prices, and that the limited partnerships had
not made substantial down payments as represented. In
several cases, Neder agreed to sign affidavits falsely stating
that he had no relationship to the shell corporations and that
he was not sharing in the profits from the inflated land sales.
By keeping for himself the amount by which the loan proceeds exceeded the original purchase price of the land, Neder
was able to obtain more than $7 million. He failed to report
nearly all of this money on his personal income tax returns.
He eventually defaulted on the loans.

Neder also engaged in a number of schemes involving land
development fraud. In 1985, he obtained a $4,150,000 construction loan to build condominiums on a project known as
Cedar Creek. To obtain the loan, he falsely represented to
the lender that he had satisfied a condition of the loan by
making advance sales of 20 condominium units. In fact, he
had been unable to meet the condition, so he secured additional buyers by making their down payments himself. He
then had the down payments transferred back to him from
the escrow accounts into which they had been placed.
Neder later defaulted on the loan without repaying any
of the principal. He employed a similar scheme to obtain
a second construction loan of $5,400,000, and unsuccessfully
attempted to obtain an additional loan in the same manner.

Neder also obtained a consolidated $14 million land acquisition and development loan for a project known as Reddie
Point. Pursuant to the loan, Neder could request funds for
work actually performed on the project. Between September 1987 and March 1988, he submitted numerous requests
based on false invoices, the lender approved the requests,

Opinion of the Court
and he obtained almost $3 million unrelated to any workactually performed.

Neder was indicted on, among other things, 9 counts ofmail fraud, in violation of 18 U. S. C. $ 1341; 9 counts of wire
fraud, in violation of $ 1343; 12 counts of bank fraud, in violation of $ 1344; and 2 counts of filing a false income tax return,in violation of 26 U. S. C. $ 7206(1). The fraud counts

charged Neder with devising and executing various schemesto defraud lenders in connection with the land acquisition
and development loans, totaling over $40 million. The taxcounts charged Neder with filing false statements of income
on his tax returns. According to the Government, Neder
failed to report more than $1 million in income for 1985 and
more than $4 million in income for 1986, both amounts reflecting profits Neder obtained from the fraudulent real estate loans.

In accordance with then-extant Circuit precedent and over
Neder's objection, the District Court instructed the jury
that, to convict on the tax offenses, it "need not consider"
the materiality of any false statements "even though that
language is used in the indictment." App. 256. The question of materiality, the court instructed, "is not a question
for the jury to decide." Ibid. The court gave a similar instruction on bank fraud, id., at 249, and subsequently found,
outside the presence of the jury, that the evidence established the materiality of all the false statements at issue, id.,
at 167. In instructing the jury on mail fraud and wire fraud,
the District Court did not include materiality as an element
of either offense. Id., at 253-255. Neder again objected
to the instruction. The jury convicted Neder of the fraud
and tax offenses, and he was sentenced to 147 months' imprisonment, 5 years' supervised release, and $25 million in
restitution.

The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the
conviction. 136 F. 3d 1459 (1998). It held that the District
Court erred under our intervening decision in United States

Opinion of the Court
v. Gaudin, 515 U. S. 506 (1995), in failing to submit the materiality element of the tax offense to the jury. It concluded,
however, that the error was subject to harmless-error analysis and, further, that the error was harmless because "materiality was not in dispute," 136 F. 3d, at 1465, and thus the
error " `did not contribute to the verdict obtained,' " ibid.
(quoting Yates v. Evatt, 500 U. S. 391, 403 (1991)). The
Court of Appeals also held that materiality is not an element
of the mail fraud, wire fraud, and bank fraud statutes, and
thus the District Court did not err in failing to submit the
question of materiality to the jury.

We granted certiorari, 525 U. S. 928 (1998), to resolve a
conflict in the Courts of Appeals on two questions: (1)
whether, and under what circumstances, the omission of an
element from the judge's charge to the jury can be harmless
error, and (2) whether materiality is an element of the federal mail fraud, wire fraud, and bank fraud statutes.

II
Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure,
which governs direct appeals from judgments of conviction
in the federal system, provides that "[a]ny error, defect, irregularity or variance which does not affect substantial
rights shall be disregarded." Although this Rule by its
terms applies to all errors where a proper objection is made
at trial, we have recognized a limited class of fundamental
constitutional errors that "defy analysis by `harmless error'
standards." Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U. S. 279, 309
(1991); see Chapman v. California, 386 U. S., at 23. Errors
of this type are so intrinsically harmful as to require automatic reversal (i. e., "affect substantial rights") without regard to their effect on the outcome. For all other constitutional errors, reviewing courts must apply Rule 52(a)'s
harmless-error analysis and must "disregar[d]" errors that
are harmless "beyond a reasonable doubt." Id., at 24.

8 NEDER v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
In this case the Government does not dispute that the Dis-trict Court erred under Gaudin in deciding the materiality

element of a $ 7206(1) offense itself, rather than submittingthe issue to the jury. See Brief for United States 10, and
n. 1. We must decide whether the error here is subject toharmless-error analysis and, if so, whether the error was
harmless. A

We have recognized that "most constitutional errors canbe harmless."

Fulminante, supra, at 306. "[I]f the de-fendant had counsel and was tried by an impartial adjudicator, there is a strong presumption that any other [con-stitutional] errors that may have occurred are subject to
harmless-error analysis." Rose v. Clark, 478 U. S. 570, 579(1986). Indeed, we have found an error to be "structural,"
and thus subject to automatic reversal, only in a "very lim-ited class of cases."

Johnson v. United States, 520 U. S. 461,468 (1997) (citing Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335 (1963)

(complete denial of counsel); Tumey v. Ohio, 273 U. S. 510(1927) (biased trial judge); Vasquez v. Hillery, 474 U. S. 254
(1986) (racial discrimination in selection of grand jury);McKaskle v. Wiggins, 465 U. S. 168 (1984) (denial of selfrepresentation at trial); Waller v. Georgia, 467 U. S. 39 (1984)(denial of public trial);

Sullivan v. Louisiana, 508 U. S. 275(1993) (defective reasonable-doubt instruction)).

The error at issue here--a jury instruction that omitsan element of the offense--differs markedly from the constitutional violations we have found to defy harmless-errorreview. Those cases, we have explained, contain a "defect

affecting the framework within which the trial proceeds,rather than simply an error in the trial process itself."

Ful-minante, supra, at 310. Such errors "infect the entire trial

process," Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U. S. 619, 630 (1993),and "necessarily render a trial fundamentally unfair," Rose,
478 U. S., at 577. Put another way, these errors deprive de-fendants of "basic protections" without which "a criminal

Opinion of the Court
trial cannot reliably serve its function as a vehicle for de-termination of guilt or innocence . . . and no criminal

punishment may be regarded as fundamentally fair." Id.,at 577-578.

Unlike such defects as the complete deprivation of counsel
or trial before a biased judge, an instruction that omits anelement of the offense does not

necessarily render a criminal trial fundamentally unfair or an unreliable vehicle for de-termining guilt or innocence. Our decision in

Johnson v.
United States, supra, is instructive. Johnson was a perjuryprosecution in which, as here, the element of materiality was

decided by the judge rather than submitted to the jury. The
defendant failed to object at trial, and we thus reviewed her
claim for "plain error." Although reserving the question
whether the omission of an element ipso facto " `affect[s] substantial rights,' " 520 U. S., at 468-469, we concluded that
the error did not warrant correction in light of the " `overwhelming' " and "uncontroverted" evidence supporting materiality, id., at 470. Based on this evidence, we explained,
the error did not " `seriously affec[t] the fairness, integrity
or public reputation of judicial proceedings.' " Id., at 469
(quoting United States v. Olano, 507 U. S. 725, 736 (1993)).

That conclusion cuts against the argument that the omission of an element will always render a trial unfair. In fact,
as this case shows, quite the opposite is true: Neder was
tried before an impartial judge, under the correct standard
of proof and with the assistance of counsel; a fairly selected,
impartial jury was instructed to consider all of the evidence
and argument in respect to Neder's defense against the tax
charges. Of course, the court erroneously failed to charge
the jury on the element of materiality, but that error did not
render Neder's trial "fundamentally unfair," as that term is
used in our cases.

We have often applied harmless-error analysis to cases
involving improper instructions on a single element of

the offense. See, e. g., Yates v. Evatt, 500 U. S. 391 (1991)

10 NEDER v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
(mandatory rebuttable presumption); Carella v. California,491 U. S. 263 (1989)

(per curiam) (mandatory conclusive
presumption); Pope v. Illinois, 481 U. S. 497 (1987) (mis-statement of element);

Rose, supra (mandatory rebuttable
presumption). In other cases, we have recognized that
improperly omitting an element from the jury can "easily beanalogized to improperly instructing the jury on an element

of the offense, an error which is subject to harmless-erroranalysis."

Johnson, supra, at 469 (citations omitted); see
also California v. Roy, 519 U. S. 2, 5 (1996) (per curiam)("The specific error at issue here--an error in the instruction

that defined the crime--is . . . as easily characterized as a
`misdescription of an element' of the crime, as it is characterized as an error of `omission' "). In both cases--misdescriptions and omissions--the erroneous instruction precludes the
jury from making a finding on the actual element of the offense. The same, we think, can be said of conclusive presumptions, which direct the jury to presume an ultimate element of the offense based on proof of certain predicate facts
(e. g., "You must presume malice if you find an intentional
killing"). Like an omission, a conclusive presumption deters
the jury from considering any evidence other than that related to the predicate facts (e. g., an intentional killing) and
"directly foreclose[s] independent jury consideration of
whether the facts proved established certain elements of the
offens[e]" (e. g., malice). Carella, 491 U. S., at 266; see id.,
at 270 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment).

The conclusion that the omission of an element is subject
to harmless-error analysis is consistent with the holding (if
not the entire reasoning) of Sullivan v. Louisiana, the case
upon which Neder principally relies. In Sullivan, the trial
court gave the jury a defective "reasonable doubt" instruction in violation of the defendant's Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights to have the charged offense proved beyond
a reasonable doubt. See Cage v. Louisiana, 498 U. S. 39
(1990) (per curiam). Applying our traditional mode of anal527US1 Unit: $U69 [05-01-01 18:41:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN

11Cite as: 527 U. S. 1 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
ysis, the Court concluded that the error was not subject toharmless-error analysis because it "vitiates

all the jury's
findings," 508 U. S., at 281, and produces "consequences thatare necessarily unquantifiable and indeterminate,"

id., at
282. By contrast, the jury-instruction error here did not
"vitiat[e] all the jury's findings." Id., at 281; see id., at 284(R

ehnquist, C. J., concurring). It did, of course, prevent
the jury from making a finding on the element of materiality.Neder argues that

Sullivan's alternative reasoning precludes the application of harmless error here. Under thatreasoning, harmless-error analysis cannot be applied to a

constitutional error that precludes the jury from rendering a verdict of guilty-beyond-a-reasonable-doubt because
"the entire premise of Chapman review is simply absent."
Id., at 280. In the absence of an actual verdict of guiltybeyond-a-reasonable-doubt, the Court explained: "[T]he
question whether the same verdict of guilty-beyond-areasonable-doubt would have been rendered absent the constitutional error is utterly meaningless. There is no object,
so to speak, upon which the harmless-error scrutiny can operate." Ibid.; see Carella, supra, at 268-269 (Scalia, J.,
concurring in judgment). Neder argues that this analysis
applies with equal force where the constitutional error, as
here, prevents the jury from rendering a "complete verdict"
on every element of the offense. As in Sullivan, Neder
argues, the basis for harmless-error review " `is simply absent.' " Brief for Petitioner 7.

Although this strand of the reasoning in Sullivan does
provide support for Neder's position, it cannot be squared
with our harmless-error cases. In Pope, for example, the
trial court erroneously instructed the jury that it could find
the defendant guilty in an obscenity prosecution if it found
that the allegedly obscene material lacked serious value
under "community standards," rather than the correct "reasonable person" standard required by the First Amendment.
481 U. S., at 499-501. Because the jury was not properly

Opinion of the Court
instructed, and consequently did not render a finding, on the
actual element of the offense, the defendant's trial did not
result in a "complete verdict" any more than in this case.
Yet we held there that harmless-error analysis was appropriate. Id., at 502-503.

Similarly, in Carella, the jury was instructed to presume
that the defendant "embezzled [a] vehicle" and "[i]nten[ded]
to commit theft" if the jury found that the defendant failed
to return a rental car within a certain number of days after
the expiration of the rental period. 491 U. S., at 264 (internal quotation marks omitted). Again, the jury's finding of
guilt cannot be seen as a "complete verdict" because the conclusive presumption "directly foreclosed independent jury
consideration of whether the facts proved established certain
elements of the offenses." Id., at 266. As in Pope, however, we held that the unconstitutional conclusive presumption was "subject to the harmless-error rule." 491 U. S., at
266.

And in Roy, a federal habeas case involving a state-court
murder conviction, the trial court erroneously failed to instruct the jury that it could convict the defendant as an
aider and abettor only if it found that the defendant had
the "intent or purpose" of aiding the confederate's crime.
519 U. S., at 3 (internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted). Despite that omission, we held that "[t]he case before
us is a case for application of the `harmless error' standard."
Id., at 5.

The Government argues, correctly we think, that the absence of a "complete verdict" on every element of the offense
establishes no more than that an improper instruction on an
element of the offense violates the Sixth Amendment's jury
trial guarantee. The issue here, however, is not whether a
jury instruction that omits an element of the offense was
error (a point that is uncontested, see supra, at 8), but
whether the error is subject to harmless-error analysis. We

Opinion of the Court
think our decisions in Pope, Carella, and Roy dictate theanswer to that question.

Forced to accept that this Court has applied harmless-error review in cases where the jury did not render a
"complete verdict" on every element of the offense, Neder
attempts to reconcile our cases by offering an approachgleaned from a plurality opinion in

Connecticut v. Johnson,
460 U. S. 73 (1983), an opinion concurring in the judgment in
Carella, supra, and language in Sullivan, supra. Under
this restrictive approach, an instructional omission, mis-description, or conclusive presumption can be subject to

harmless-error analysis only in three "rare situations": (1)
where the defendant is acquitted of the offense on which the
jury was improperly instructed (and, despite the defendant's
argument that the instruction affected another count, the improper instruction had no bearing on it); (2) where the defendant admitted the element on which the jury was improperly instructed; and (3) where other facts necessarily found
by the jury are the "functional equivalent" of the omitted,
misdescribed, or presumed element. See Sullivan, supra,
at 281; Carella, supra, at 270-271 (Scalia, J., concurring in
judgment); Johnson, supra, at 87 (plurality opinion). Neder
understandably contends that Pope, Carella, and Roy fall
within this last exception, which explains why the Court
in those cases held that the instructional error could be
harmless.

We believe this approach is mistaken for more than one
reason. As an initial matter, we are by no means certain
that the cases just mentioned meet the "functional equivalence" test as Neder at times articulates it. See Brief for
Petitioner 29 ("[A]ppellate courts [cannot be] given even the
slightest latitude to review the record to `fill the gaps' in a
jury verdict, as `minor' as those gaps may seem"). In Pope,
for example, there was necessarily a "gap" between what the
jury did find (that the allegedly obscene material lacked
value under "community standards") and what it was re527US1 Unit: $U69 [05-01-01 18:41:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN
14 NEDER v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
quired to find to convict (that the material lacked valueunder a national "reasonable person" standard). Petitioner's submission would have mandated reversal for a new trialin that case, because a juror in Rockford, Illinois, who found
that the material lacked value under community standards,
would not necessarily have found that it did so under pre-sumably broader and more tolerant national standards. But

since we held that harmless-error analysis was appropriatein

Pope, that case not only does not support petitioner's approach, but rejects it.Petiti oner 's submission a lso i mports into the i nitial

structural-error determination (i. e., whether an error is
structural) a case-by-case approach that is more consistent
with our traditional harmless-error inquiry (i. e., whether an
error is harmless). Under our cases, a constitutional error
is either structural or it is not. Thus, even if we were inclined to follow a broader "functional equivalence" test (e. g.,
where other facts found by the jury are "so closely related"
to the omitted element "that no rational jury could find those
facts without also finding" the omitted element, Sullivan,
508 U. S., at 281 (internal quotation marks omitted)), such a
test would be inconsistent with our traditional categorical
approach to structural errors.

We also note that the present case arose in the legal equivalent of a laboratory test tube. The trial court, following
existing law, ruled that the question of materiality was for
the court, not the jury. It therefore refused a charge on the
question of materiality. But future cases are not likely to
be so clear cut. In Roy, we said that the error in question
could be "as easily characterized as a `misdescription of an
element' of the crime, as it is characterized as an error of
`omission.' " 519 U. S., at 5. As petitioner concedes, his
submission would thus call into question the far more common subcategory of misdescriptions. And it would require
a reviewing court in each case to determine just how serious
a "misdescription" it was.

Opinion of the Court
Difficult as such issues would be when dealing with theample volume defining federal crimes, they would be measurably compounded by the necessity for federal courts, review-ing state convictions under 28 U. S. C. $ 2254, to ascertain
the elements of the offense as defined in the laws of 50 differ-ent States.

It would not be illogical to extend the reasoning of Sullivan from a defective "reasonable doubt" instruction to a fail-ure to instruct on an element of the crime. But, as indicated

in the foregoing discussion, the matter is not res nova underour case law. And if the life of the law has not been logic
but experience, see O. Holmes, The Common Law 1 (1881),we are entitled to stand back and see what would be accomplished by such an extension in this case. The omitted ele-ment was materiality. Petitioner underreported $5 million
on his tax returns, and did not contest the element of materi-ality at trial. Petitioner does not suggest that he would introduce any evidence bearing upon the issue of materialityif so allowed. Reversal without any consideration of the effect of the error upon the verdict would send the case backfor retrial--a retrial not focused at all on the issue of materiality, but on contested issues on which the jury was properlyinstructed. We do not think the Sixth Amendment requires
us to veer away from settled precedent to reach such aresult.

B
Having concluded that the omission of an element is anerror that is subject to harmless-error analysis, the question

remains whether Neder's conviction can stand because theerror was harmless. In

Chapman v. California, 386 U. S.18 (1967), we set forth the test for determining whether a

constitutional error is harmless. That test, we said, iswhether it appears "beyond a reasonable doubt that the
error complained of did not contribute to the verdict ob-tained."

Id., at 24; see Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U. S.673, 681 (1986) ("[A]n otherwise valid conviction should not

be set aside if the reviewing court may confidently say, onthe whole record, that the constitutional error was harmless

beyond a reasonable doubt").To obtain a conviction on the tax offense at issue, the Government must prove that the defendant filed a tax return
"which he does not believe to be true and correct as to everymaterial matter." 26 U. S. C. $ 7206(1). In general, a false

statement is material if it has "a natural tendency to influ-ence, or [is] capable of influencing, the decision of the decisionmaking body to which it was addressed." United Statesv.

Gaudin, 515 U. S., at 509 (quoting Kungys v. United States,
485 U. S. 759, 770 (1988) (internal quotation marks omitted)).In a prosecution under $ 7206(1), several courts have determined that "any failure to report income is material."
United States v. Holland, 880 F. 2d 1091, 1096 (CA9 1989);see 136 F. 3d, at 1465 (collecting cases). Under either of

these formulations, no jury could reasonably find that Neder's failure to report substantial amounts of income on his
tax returns was not "a material matter." 1

At trial, the Government introduced evidence that Neder
failed to report over $5 million in income from the loans
he obtained. The failure to report such substantial income
incontrovertibly establishes that Neder's false statements
were material to a determination of his income tax liability.
The evidence supporting materiality was so overwhelming,
in fact, that Neder did not argue to the jury--and does not
argue here--that his false statements of income could be
found immaterial. Instead, he defended against the tax
charges by arguing that the loan proceeds were not income

1 Justice Stevens says that the failure to charge the jury on materiality is harmless error in this case because the jury verdict "necessarily
included a finding on that issue." Post, at 26 (opinion concurring in part
and concurring in judgment). While the evidence of materiality is overwhelming, it is incorrect to say that the jury made such a finding; the
court explicitly directed the jury not to consider the materiality of any
false statements.

Opinion of the Court
because he intended to repay the loans, and that he reason-ably believed, based on the advice of his accountant and lawyer, that he need not report the proceeds as income. App.208-211, 235 (closing argument). In this situation, where a
reviewing court concludes beyond a reasonable doubt thatthe omitted element was uncontested and supported by overwhelming evidence, such that the jury verdict would havebeen the same absent the error, the erroneous instruction is
properly found to be harmless. We think it beyond cavilhere that the error "did not contribute to the verdict obtained." Chapman, supra, at 24.Neder disputes our conclusion that the error in this case
was harmless. Relying on language in our Sullivan andYates decisions, he argues that a finding of harmless error
may be made only upon a determination that the jury restedits verdict on evidence that its instructions allowed it to consider. See Sullivan, 508 U. S., at 279; Yates, 500 U. S., at404. To rely on overwhelming record evidence of guilt the
jury did not actually consider, he contends, would be to dis-pense with trial by jury and allow judges to direct a guilty
verdict on an element of the offense.2But at bottom this is simply another form of the argument
that a failure to instruct on any element of the crime is notsubject to harmless-error analysis. Yates involved constitutionally infirm presumptions on an issue that was the cruxof the case--the defendant's intent. But in the case of an
omitted element, as the present one, the jury's instructionspreclude any consideration of evidence relevant to the omit2 Justice Scalia, in his opinion concurring in part and dissenting in
part, also suggests that if a failure to charge on an uncontested element
of the offense may be harmless error, the next step will be to allow a
directed verdict against a defendant in a criminal case contrary to Rose
v. Clark, 478 U. S. 570, 578 (1986). Happily, our course of constitutional
adjudication has not been characterized by this "in for a penny, in for a
pound" approach. We have no hesitation reaffirming Rose at the same
time that we subject the narrow class of cases like the present one to
harmless-error review.

Opinion of the Court
ted element, and thus there could be no harmless-error anal-ysis. Since we have previously concluded that harmlesserror analysis is appropriate in such a case, we must look toother cases decided under

Chapman for the proper mode
of analysis.

The erroneous admission of evidence in violation of theFifth Amendment's guarantee against self-incrimination, see

Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U. S. 279 (1991), and the errone-ous exclusion of evidence in violation of the right to confront
witnesses guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment, see Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U. S. 673 (1986), are both subject
to harmless-error analysis under our cases. Such errors,
no less than the failure to instruct on an element in violation of the right to a jury trial, infringe upon the jury's factfinding role and affect the jury's deliberative process in ways
that are, strictly speaking, not readily calculable. We think,
therefore, that the harmless-error inquiry must be essentially the same: Is it clear beyond a reasonable doubt that a
rational jury would have found the defendant guilty absent
the error? To set a barrier so high that it could never be
surmounted would justify the very criticism that spawned
the harmless-error doctrine in the first place: "Reversal for
error, regardless of its effect on the judgment, encourages
litigants to abuse the judicial process and bestirs the public
to ridicule it." R. Traynor, The Riddle of Harmless Error
50 (1970).

We believe that where an omitted element is supported by
uncontroverted evidence, this approach reaches an appropriate balance between "society's interest in punishing the
guilty [and] the method by which decisions of guilt are to be
made." Connecticut v. Johnson, 460 U. S., at 86 (plurality
opinion). The harmless-error doctrine, we have said, "recognizes the principle that the central purpose of a criminal
trial is to decide the factual question of the defendant's guilt
or innocence, . . . and promotes public respect for the criminal
process by focusing on the underlying fairness of the trial."

Opinion of the Court
Van Arsdall, supra, at 681. At the same time, we have
recognized that trial by jury in serious criminal cases "was
designed `to guard against a spirit of oppression and tyranny
on the part of rulers,' and `was from very early times insisted
on by our ancestors in the parent country, as the great bulwark of their civil and political liberties.' " Gaudin, 515
U. S., at 510-511 (quoting 2 J. Story, Commentaries on the
Constitution of the United States 540-541 (4th ed. 1873)).
In a case such as this one, where a defendant did not, and
apparently could not, bring forth facts contesting the omitted
element, answering the question whether the jury verdict
would have been the same absent the error does not fundamentally undermine the purposes of the jury trial guarantee.

Of course, safeguarding the jury guarantee will often require that a reviewing court conduct a thorough examination
of the record. If, at the end of that examination, the court
cannot conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury verdict would have been the same absent the error--for example, where the defendant contested the omitted element and
raised evidence sufficient to support a contrary finding--it
should not find the error harmless.

A reviewing court making this harmless-error inquiry
does not, as Justice Traynor put it, "become in effect a second jury to determine whether the defendant is guilty."
Traynor, supra, at 21. Rather a court, in typical appellatecourt fashion, asks whether the record contains evidence
that could rationally lead to a contrary finding with respect
to the omitted element. If the answer to that question is
"no," holding the error harmless does not "reflec[t] a denigration of the constitutional rights involved." Rose, 478 U. S.,
at 577. On the contrary, it "serve[s] a very useful purpose
insofar as [it] block[s] setting aside convictions for small errors or defects that have little, if any, likelihood of having
changed the result of the trial." Chapman, 386 U. S., at 22.
We thus hold that the District Court's failure to submit the

20 NEDER v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
element of materiality to the jury with respect to the taxcharges was harmless error.

III
We also granted certiorari in this case to decide whethermateriality is an element of a "scheme or artifice to defraud"

under the federal mail fraud (18 U. S. C. $ 1341), wire fraud($ 1343), and bank fraud ($ 1344) statutes. The Court of Appeals concluded that the failure to submit materiality to thejury was not error because the fraud statutes do not require
that a "scheme to defraud" employ material falsehoods.We disagree.

Under the framework set forth in United States v. Wells,519 U. S. 482 (1997), we first look to the text of the statutes
at issue to discern whether they require a showing of materi-ality. In this case, we need not dwell long on the text because, as the parties agree, none of the fraud statutes definesthe phrase "scheme or artifice to defraud," or even mentions
materiality. Although the mail fraud and wire fraud stat-utes contain different jurisdictional elements ($ 1341 requires
use of the mails while $ 1343 requires use of interstate wirefacilities), they both prohibit, in pertinent part, "any scheme
or artifice to defraud" or to obtain money or property "bymeans of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or
promises." 3 The bank fraud statute, which was modeled on

3 Section 1341 provides in pertinent part:
"Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice
to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, . . . for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice or attempting so to do, places in any post office
or authorized depository for mail matter, any matter or thing whatever to
be sent or delivered by the Postal Service, or deposits or causes to be
deposited any matter or thing whatever to be sent or delivered by any
private or commercial interstate carrier, or takes or receives therefrom,
any such matter or thing, or knowingly causes to be delivered by mail or
such carrier according to the direction thereon, or at the place at which it
is directed to be delivered by the person to whom it is addressed, any such

Opinion of the Court
the mail and wire fraud statutes, similarly prohibits any"scheme or artifice to defraud a financial institution" or to

obtain any property of a financial institution "by false orfraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises."

4 Thus,

based solely on a "natural reading of the full text," id., at 490,materiality would not be an element of the fraud statutes.

That does not end our inquiry, however, because in inter-preting statutory language there is a necessary second step.
It is a well-established rule of construction that " `[w]hereCongress uses terms that have accumulated settled meaning
under . . . the common law, a court must infer, unless thestatute otherwise dictates, that Congress means to incorporate the established meaning of these terms.' " NationwideMut. Ins. Co. v. Darden, 503 U. S. 318, 322 (1992) (quoting

five years, or both. If the violation affects a financial institution, such

730, 739 (1989)); see Standard Oil Co. of N. J. v. UnitedStates, 221 U. S. 1, 59 (1911) ("[W]here words are employed

in a statute which had at the time a well-known meaning atcommon law or in the law of this country, they are presumed
to have been used in that sense"). Neder contends that "de-fraud" is just such a term, and that Congress implicitly incorporated its common-law meaning, including its requirementof materiality,

5 into the statutes at issue.

The Government does not dispute that both at the time of
the mail fraud statute's original enactment in 1872, and laterwhen Congress enacted the wire fraud and bank fraud statutes, actionable "fraud" had a well-settled meaning at com-mon law. Nor does it dispute that the well-settled meaning
of "fraud" required a misrepresentation or concealment of
material fact. Indeed, as the sources we are aware of
demonstrate, the common law could not have conceived of

"fraud" without proof of materiality. See BMW of North
America, Inc. v. Gore, 517 U. S. 559, 579 (1996) ("[A]ctionable
fraud requires a material misrepresentation or omission"(citing Restatement (Second) of Torts $ 538 (1977); W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keetonon Law of Torts $ 108 (5th ed. 1984)));

party"). Thus, under the rule that Congress intends to in-corporate the well-settled meaning of the common-law terms

it uses, we cannot infer from the absence of an express refer-ence to materiality that Congress intended to drop that element from the fraud statutes.6 On the contrary, we must
presume that Congress intended to incorporate materiality
" `unless the statute otherwise dictates.' " Nationwide Mut.
Ins., supra, at 322.7The Government attempts to rebut this presumption by

arguing that the term "defraud" would bear its common-lawmeaning only if the fraud statutes "indicated that Congress
had codified the crime of false pretenses or one of thecommon-law torts sounding in fraud." Brief for United
States 37. Instead, the Government argues, Congress chose

6 We concluded as much in Field v. Mans, 516 U. S. 59, 69 (1995):
" `[F]alse pretenses, a false representation, or actual frau[d]' carry the
acquired meaning of terms of art. They are common-law terms, and . . .
they imply elements that the common law has defined them to include. . . .
Congress could have enumerated their elements, but Congress's contrary
drafting choice did not deprive them of a significance richer than the bare
statement of their terms."

7 The Government argues that because Congress has provided express

materiality requirements in other statutes prohibiting fraudulent conduct, the absence of such an express reference in the fraud statutes at
issue " `speaks volumes.' " Brief for United States 35 (citing 21 U. S. C.

$ 843(a)(4)(A)) (prohibiting the furnishing of "false or fraudulent material
information" in documents required under federal drug laws); 26 U. S. C.

$ 6700(a)(2)(A) (criminalizing the making of a statement regarding investment tax benefits that an individual "knows or has reason to kno[w] is false
or fraudulent as to any material matter"). These later enacted statutes,
however, differ from the fraud statutes here in that they prohibit both
"false" and "fraudulent" statements or information. Because the term
"false statement" does not imply a materiality requirement, United States
v. Wells, 519 U. S. 482, 491 (1997), the word "material" limits the statutes'
scope to material falsehoods. Moreover, these statutes cannot rebut the
presumption that Congress intended to incorporate the common-law
meaning of the term "fraud" in the mail fraud, wire fraud, and bank fraud
statutes. That rebuttal can only come from the text or structure of the
fraud statutes themselves. See Nationwide Mut. Ins., 503 U. S., at 322.

24 NEDER v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
to unmoor the mail fraud statute from its common-law ana-logs by punishing, not the completed fraud, but rather any

person "having devised or intending to devise any schemeor artifice to defraud." Read in this light, the Government
contends, there is no basis to infer that Congress intended
to limit criminal liability to conduct that would constitute"fraud" at common law, and in particular, to

material misrepresentations or omissions. Rather, criminal liabilitywould exist so long as the defendant

intended to deceive the
victim, even if the particular means chosen turn out to beimmaterial,

i. e., incapable of influencing the intended victim.
See n. 3, supra.

The Government relies heavily on Durland v. United
States, 161 U. S. 306 (1896), our first decision construing the
mail fraud statute, to support its argument that the fraud
statutes sweep more broadly than common-law fraud. But
Durland was different from this case. There, the defendant, who had used the mails to sell bonds he did not intend
to honor, argued that he could not be held criminally liable
because his conduct did not fall within the scope of the
common-law crime of "false pretenses." We rejected the
argument that "the statute reaches only such cases as, at
common law, would come within the definition of `false
pretenses,' in order to make out which there must be a
misrepresentation as to some existing fact and not a mere
promise as to the future." Id., at 312. Instead, we construed the statute to "includ[e] everything designed to defraud by representations as to the past or present, or suggestions and promises as to the future." Id., at 313. Although
Durland held that the mail fraud statute reaches conduct
that would not have constituted "false pretenses" at common
law, it did not hold, as the Government argues, that the statute encompasses more than common-law fraud.

In one sense, the Government is correct that the fraud
statutes did not incorporate all the elements of common-law

ance" and "damages," for example, plainly have no place inthe federal fraud statutes. See, e. g., United States v. Stewart, 872 F. 2d 957, 960 (CA10 1989) ("[Under the mail fraudstatute,] the government does not have to prove actual reliance upon the defendant's misrepresentations"); United
States v. Rowe, 56 F. 2d 747, 749 (CA2) (L. Hand, J.) ("Civillyof course the [mail fraud statute] would fail without proof of

damage, but that has no application to criminal liability"),cert. denied, 286 U. S. 554 (1932). By prohibiting the
"scheme to defraud," rather than the completed fraud, theelements of reliance and damage would clearly be inconsistent with the statutes Congress enacted. But while the lan-guage of the fraud statutes is incompatible with these requirements, the Government has failed to show that thislanguage is inconsistent with a materiality requirement.

Accordingly, we hold that materiality of falsehood is anelement of the federal mail fraud, wire fraud, and bank fraud
statutes. Consistent with our normal practice where thecourt below has not yet passed on the harmlessness of any
error, see Carella, 491 U. S., at 266-267, we remand this caseto the Court of Appeals for it to consider in the first instance
whether the jury-instruction error was harmless.

IV
The judgment of the Court of Appeals respecting the tax
fraud counts is affirmed. The judgment of the Court ofAppeals on the remaining counts is reversed, and the case

is remanded for further proceedings consistent with thisopinion.

It is so ordered.
Justice Stevens, concurring in part and concurring in
the judgment.

Although I do not agree with the Court's analysis of the
harmless-error issue in Part II of its opinion, I do join PartsI and III and concur in the judgment.

Opinion of Stevens, J.

I
This is an easy case. The federal tax fraud statute, 26U. S. C. $ 7206(1), prohibits the filing of any return that the

taxpayer "does not believe to be true and correct as to every
material matter." * (Emphasis added.) The Court of Ap-peals, in accordance with other courts, construed "material

matter" to describe "any information necessary to a determi-nation of a taxpayer's income tax liability." 136 F. 3d 1459,
1465 (CA11 1998) (citing United States v. Aramony, 88 F. 3d
1369, 1384 (CA4 1996); United States v. Klausner, 80 F. 3d55, 60 (CA2 1996);

United States v. Holland, 880 F. 2d 1091,
1096 (CA9 1989)). Petitioner has not challenged this legalstandard.

The jury found that petitioner knowingly and "falsely re-ported [his] total income in his 1985 return . . . and in his
1986 return." App. 256 ( jury instructions). A taxpayer's"total income" is obviously "information necessary to a determination of a taxpayer's income tax liability." 136 F. 3d,
at 1465. The jury verdict, therefore, was not merely thefunctional equivalent of a finding on any possible materiality

issue; it necessarily included a finding on that issue. Thatbeing so, the trial judge's failure to give a separate instruction on that issue was harmless error under any test ofharmlessness.

But the Court does not rest its decision on this logic.Rather, it finds the instructional error harmless because
petitioner "did not, and apparently could not, bring forth

*Section 7206 provides, in relevant part:
"Any person who--

"Willfully makes and subscribes any return, statement, or other document, which contains or is verified by a written declaration that is made

facts contesting the omitted element." Ante, at 19. I can-not subscribe to this analysis. However the standard for

deciding whether a trial error was harmless is formulated,I understand that there may be disagreement over its application in particular cases. The three contrasting opinions in
Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U. S. 279 (1991), vividly illus-trate this point: Justice White stated that the admission of a

defendant's coerced confession, by its very nature, couldnever be harmless,

id., at 295-302; Justice Kennedy stated
that such evidence can be harmless but that the appellatecourt "must appreciate the indelible impact a full confession

may have on the trier of fact," id., at 313 (opinion concurring
in judgment); and The Chief Justice, joined by Justice
Scalia, stated that the admission of such evidence presents
"a classic case of harmless error" when other evidence points
strongly toward guilt, id., at 312 (dissenting opinion). There
is, nevertheless, a distinction of true importance between a
harmless-error test that focuses on what the jury did decide,
rather than on what appellate judges think the jury would
have decided if given an opportunity to pass on an issue.
That is why, in my view, the "harmless-error doctrine may
enable a court to remove a taint from proceedings in order
to preserve a jury's findings, but it cannot constitutionally
supplement those findings." Pope v. Illinois, 481 U. S. 497,
509 (1987) (Stevens, J., dissenting).

The Court of Appeals' judgment could, and should, be affirmed on the ground that the jury verdict in this case necessarily included a finding that petitioner's tax returns were
not "true and correct as to every material matter." I therefore cannot join the analysis in Part II of the Court's opinion,
which--without explaining why the jury failed necessarily to
find a material omission--states that judges may find elements of an offense satisfied whenever the defendant failed
to contest the element or raise evidence sufficient to support
a contrary finding. My views on this central issue are thus
close to those expressed by Justice Scalia, but I do not

join his dissenting opinion because it is internally inconsist-ent and its passion is misdirected.

II
If the Court's tolerance of the trial judge's Sixth Amend-ment error in this case were, as

Justice Scalia's dissentsuggests,
post, at 30, as serious as malpractice on "the spinalcolumn of American democracy," surely the error would

require reversal of the conviction regardless of whetherdefense counsel made a timely objection. Yet the dissent
states that reversal is appropriate only when a defendantmade a timely objection to the deprivation.

Post, at 35(opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part). It is

for that reason that I find tension between the force of
Justice Scalia's eloquent rhetoric and the far narrowerrule that he actually espouses.

There is even more tension between that rhetoric and hisperception of the proper role of the jury in cases that are
far more controversial than the prosecution of white-collarcrimes. The history that he recounts provides powerful
support for my view that this Court has not been properlysensitive to the importance of protecting the right to have a
jury resolve critical issues of fact when there is a specialdanger that elected judges may listen to the voices of voters
rather than witnesses. A First Amendment case and a capi-tal case will illustrate my point.

In Pope, we found constitutional error in the conviction oftwo attendants in an adult bookstore because the trial court
had instructed the jury to answer the question whether cer-tain magazines lacked "serious literary, artistic, political, or
scientific value" by applying the community standards thatprevailed in Illinois. 481 U. S., at 500-501. As the history
of many of our now-valued works of art demonstrates, thiserror would have permitted the jury to resolve the issue
against the defendants based on their appraisal of the viewsof the majority of Illinois' citizens despite the fact that under

Opinion of Stevens, J.
a proper instruction the jury would have acquitted if theythought a more discerning minority would have found true

artistic value in the publications. Indeed, under the instruc-tion given to the jury in that case, James Joyce would surely
have been convicted for selling copies of the first edition ofUlysses in Rockford, Illinois, even though there were a few
readers in Paris who immediately recognized the value of hiswork. The

Pope Court's conclusion that the unconstitu-tional instruction might have been harmless entirely ignored

the danger that individual distaste for sexually explicit ma-terials may subconsciously influence a judge's evaluation
of how a jury would decide a question that it did not actu-ally resolve. It is, in fact, particularly distressing that all
of my colleagues appear today to endorse Pope's harmless-error analysis.

Admittedly, that endorsement is consistent with the hold-ing in Part II of the Court's opinion in

Walton v. Arizona,497 U. S. 639, 647-649 (1990), that a judge may make the

factual findings that render a defendant eligible for the deathpenalty. As I have previously argued, however, that holding was not faithful to the history that was reviewed by "thewise and inspiring voice that spoke for the Court in

Duncanv. Louisiana, [391 U. S. 145 (1968)]." Id., at 709-714 (S

tevens, J., dissenting). Nor was it faithful to the history that
Justice Scalia recounts today. Of course, Blackstone wasconcerned about judges exposed to the voice of the higher

authority personified by the Crown, whereas today the con-cern is with the impact of popular opinion. It remains clear,
however, that the constitutional right to be tried by a juryof one's peers provides "an inestimable safeguard against the
corrupt or overzealous prosecutor and against the compliant,biased, or eccentric judge." Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S.
145, 156 (1968). III

obviously correct. In my dissent in United States v. Wells,519 U. S. 482, 510 (1997), I pointed out that the vast majority

of judges who had confronted the question had placed thesame construction on the federal statute criminalizing false
statements to federally insured banks, 18 U. S. C. $ 1014. Irepeat this point to remind the Congress that an amendment
to $ 1014 would both harmonize these sections and avoid thepotential injustice created by the Court's decision in

Wells.

Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Souter and Justice Ginsburg join, concurring in part and dissenting inpart.

I join Parts I and III of the Court's opinion. I do not joinPart II, however, and I dissent from the judgment of the
Court, because I believe that depriving a criminal defendantof the right to have the jury determine his guilt of the crime
charged--which necessarily means his commission of everyelement of the crime charged--can never be harmless.

I
Article III, $ 2, cl. 3, of the Constitution provides: "TheTrial of all Crimes, except in Cases of Impeachment, shall

be by Jury . . . ." The Sixth Amendment provides: "In allcriminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a
speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury . . . ." Whenthis Court deals with the content of this guarantee--the only
one to appear in both the body of the Constitution and theBill of Rights--it is operating upon the spinal column of
American democracy. William Blackstone, the Framers' ac-cepted authority on English law and the English Constitution, described the right to trial by jury in criminal prosecu-tions as "the grand bulwark of [the Englishman's] liberties
. . . secured to him by the great charter." 4 W. Blackstone,Commentaries *349. One of the indictments of the Declaration of Independence against King George III was that hehad "subject[ed] us to a Jurisdiction foreign to our Constitu527US1 Unit: $U69 [05-01-01 18:41:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of Scalia, J.
tion, and unacknowledged by our Laws" in approving legislation "[f]or depriving us, in many Cases, of the Benefits
of Trial by Jury." Alexander Hamilton wrote that "[t]he
friends and adversaries of the plan of the convention, if they
agree in nothing else, concur at least in the value they set
upon the trial by jury: Or if there is any difference between
them, it consists in this, the former regard it as a valuable
safeguard to liberty, the latter represent it as the very palladium of free government." The Federalist No. 83, p. 426 (M.
Beloff ed. 1987). The right to trial by jury in criminal cases
was the only guarantee common to the 12 state constitutions
that predated the Constitutional Convention, and it has appeared in the constitution of every State to enter the Union
thereafter. Alschuler & Deiss, A Brief History of the Criminal Jury in the United States, 61 U. Chi. L. Rev. 867, 870,
875, n. 44 (1994). By comparison, the right to counsel--deprivation of which we have also held to be structural error--
is a Johnny-come-lately: Defense counsel did not become a
regular fixture of the criminal trial until the mid-1800's.
See W. Beaney, Right to Counsel in American Courts 226
(1955).

The right to be tried by a jury in criminal cases obviously
means the right to have a jury determine whether the defendant has been proved guilty of the crime charged. And
since all crimes require proof of more than one element to
establish guilt (involuntary manslaughter, for example, requires (1) the killing (2) of a human being (3) negligently), it
follows that trial by jury means determination by a jury that
all elements were proved. The Court does not contest this.
It acknowledges that the right to trial by jury was denied in
the present case, since one of the elements was not--despite
the defendant's protestation--submitted to be passed upon
by the jury. But even so, the Court lets the defendant's
sentence stand, because we judges can tell that he is unquestionably guilty.

32 NEDER v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of Scalia, J.
Even if we allowed (as we do not) other structural errorsin criminal trials to be pronounced "harmless" by judges--a

point I shall address in due course--it is obvious that wecould not allow judges to validate this one. The constitutionally required step that was omitted here is distinctive, inthat the basis for it is precisely that, absent voluntary waiver
of the jury right, the Constitution does not trust judges to
make determinations of criminal guilt. Perhaps the Courtis so enamoured of judges in general, and federal judges in

particular, that it forgets that they (we) are officers of theGovernment, and hence proper objects of that healthy suspicion of the power of government which possessed the Fram-ers and is embodied in the Constitution. Who knows?--

20 years of appointments of federal judges by oppressiveadministrations might produce judges willing to enforce
oppressive criminal laws, and to interpret criminal lawsoppressively--at least in the view of the citizens in some
vicinages where criminal prosecutions must be brought.And so the people reserved the function of determining criminal guilt to themselves, sitting as jurors. It is not withinthe power of us Justices to cancel that reservation--neither
by permitting trial judges to determine the guilt of a defend-ant who has not waived the jury right, nor (when a trial
judge has done so anyway) by reviewing the facts ourselvesand pronouncing the defendant without-a-doubt guilty. The
Court's decision today is the only instance I know of (or couldconceive of) in which the remedy for a constitutional violation by a trial judge (making the determination of criminalguilt reserved to the jury) is a repetition of the same constitutional violation by the appellate court (making thedetermination of criminal guilt reserved to the jury).

II
The Court's decision would be wrong even if we ignoredthe distinctive character of this constitutional violation.

The Court reaffirms the rule that it would be structural

error (not susceptible of "harmless-error" analysis) to " `viti-at[e]

all the jury's findings.' " Ante, at 11 (quoting Sullivan
v. Louisiana, 508 U. S. 275, 281 (1993)). A court cannot, nomatter how clear the defendant's culpability, direct a guilty

verdict. See Carpenters v. United States, 330 U. S. 395, 410
(1947); Rose v. Clark, 478 U. S. 570, 578 (1986); Arizona v.
Fulminante, 499 U. S. 279, 294 (1991) (White, J., dissenting).
The question that this raises is why, if denying the right toconviction by jury is structural error, taking

one of the elements of the crime away from the jury should be treateddifferently from taking

all of them away--since failure to
prove one, no less than failure to prove all, utterly prevents
conviction.

The Court never asks, much less answers, this question.
Indeed, we do not know, when the Court's opinion is done,
how many elements can be taken away from the jury with
impunity, so long as appellate judges are persuaded that the
defendant is surely guilty. What if, in the present case, besides keeping the materiality issue for itself, the District
Court had also refused to instruct the jury to decide whether

the defendant signed his tax return? See 26 U. S. C.

$ 7206(1). If Neder had never contested that element of
the offense, and the record contained a copy of his signed
return, would his conviction be automatically reversed in
that situation but not in this one, even though he would be
just as obviously guilty? We do not know. We know that
all elements cannot be taken from the jury, and that one can.
How many is too many (or perhaps what proportion is too
high) remains to be determined by future improvisation.
All we know for certain is that the number is somewhere
between tuppence and 19 shillings 11, since the Court's only
response to my assertion that there is no principled distinction between this case and a directed verdict is that
"our course of constitutional adjudication has not been characterized by this `in for a penny, in for a pound' approach."
See ante, at 17, n. 2.

527US1 Unit: $U69 [05-01-01 18:41:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN
34 NEDER v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of Scalia, J.
The underlying theme of the Court's opinion is that takingthe element of materiality from the jury did not render Neder's trial unfair, because the judge certainly reached the"right" result. But the same could be said of a directed verdict against the defendant--which would be per se reversible
no matter how overwhelming the unfavorable evidence.See

Rose v. Clark, supra, at 578. The very premise of
structural-error review is that even convictions reflectingthe "right" result are reversed for the sake of protecting a

basic right. For example, in Tumey v. Ohio, 273 U. S. 510(1927), where we reversed the defendant's conviction because
he had been tried before a biased judge, the State argued
that "the evidence shows clearly that the defendant was
guilty and that he was only fined $100, which was the minimum amount, and therefore that he can not complain of a
lack of due process, either in his conviction or in the amount
of the judgment." Id., at 535. We rejected this argument
out of hand, responding that "[n]o matter what the evidence
was against him, he had the right to have an impartial
judge." Ibid. (emphasis added). The amount of evidence
against a defendant who has properly preserved his objection, while relevant to determining whether a given error
was harmless, has nothing to do with determining whether
the error is subject to harmless-error review in the first
place.

The Court points out that in Johnson v. United States, 520
U. S. 461 (1997), we affirmed the petitioner's conviction even
though the element of materiality had been withheld from
the jury. But the defendant in that case, unlike the defendant here, had not requested a materiality instruction. In the
context of such unobjected-to error, the mere deprivation of
substantial rights "does not, without more," warrant reversal, United States v. Olano, 507 U. S. 725, 737 (1993), but
the appellant must also show that the deprivation "seriously
affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial
proceedings," Johnson, supra, at 469 (quoting Olano, supra,

at 736) (internal quotation marks omitted). Johnson standsfor the proposition that, just as the absolute right to trial by

jury can be waived, so also the failure to object to its depri-vation at the point where the deprivation can be remedied
will preclude automatic reversal.1Insofar as it applies to the jury-trial requirement, the
structural-error rule does not exclude harmless-error analy-sis--though it is harmless-error analysis of a peculiar sort,
looking not to whether the jury's verdict would have beenthe

same without the error, but rather to whether the errordid not prevent the jury's verdict. The failure of the court

to instruct the jury properly--whether by omitting anelement of the offense or by so misdescribing it that it is
effectively removed from the jury's consideration--can beharmless, if the elements of guilt that the jury

did find neces-sarily embraced the one omitted or misdescribed. This was

clearly spelled out by our unanimous opinion in Sullivan v.
Louisiana, supra, which said that harmless-error review
"looks . . . to the basis on which `the jury actually restedits verdict.' " 508 U. S., at 279 (quoting

Yates v. Evatt, 500
U. S. 391, 404 (1991)). Where the facts necessarily found by
the jury (and not those merely discerned by the appellatecourt) support the existence of the element omitted or misdescribed in the instruction, the omission or misdescriptionis harmless.

1 Contrary to Justice Stevens' suggestion, ante, at 28 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment), there is nothing "internally inconsistent" about believing that a procedural guarantee is fundamental
while also believing that it must be asserted in a timely fashion. It is a
universally acknowledged principle of law that one who sleeps on his
rights--even fundamental rights--may lose them.

2 Justice Stevens thinks that the jury findings as to the amounts that

petitioner failed to report on his tax returns "necessarily included" a finding on materiality, since " `total income' is obviously `information necessary to a determination of a taxpayer's income tax liability.' " Ante, at
26 (emphasis added). If that analysis were valid, we could simply dispense with submitting the materiality issue to the jury in all future tax

be filled by the factfinding of judges. This formulation ade-quately explains the three cases, see California v. Roy, 519

U. S. 2, 6 (1996) (Scalia, J., concurring); Carella v. Cali-fornia, 491 U. S. 263, 270-273 (1989) (S

calia, J., concur-ring in judgment);
Pope v. Illinois, 481 U. S. 497, 504 (1987)(S
calia, J., concurring),3 that the majority views as "dic-tat[ing] the answer" to the question before us today. Ante,

at 13. In casting Sullivan aside, the majority does morethan merely return to the state of confusion that existed
in our prior cases; it throws open the gate for appellatecourts to trample over the jury's function.

cases involving understatement of income; a finding of intentional understatement would be a finding of guilt--no matter how insignificant the
understatement might be, and no matter whether it was offset by understatement of deductions as well. But the right to a jury trial on all elements of the offense does not mean the right to a jury trial on only so
many elements as are necessary in order logically to deduce the remainder. The jury has the right to apply its own logic (or illogic) to its decision
to convict or acquit. At bottom, Justice Stevens "obviously" represents his judgment that any reasonable jury would have to think that the
misstated amounts were material. Cf. ante, at 16, n. 1. It is, in other
words, nothing more than a repackaging of the majority's approach, which
allows a judge to determine what a jury "would have found" if asked.
And it offers none of the protection that Justice Stevens promises the
jury will deliver "against the corrupt or overzealous prosecutor and
against the compliant, biased, or eccentric judge." Ante, at 29 (quoting
Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 156 (1968)).

3 The Court asserts that this "functional equivalent" test does not explain Pope, since "a juror in Rockford, Illinois, who found that the [allegedly obscene] material lacked value under community standards, would
not necessarily have found that it did so under presumably broader and
more tolerant national standards." Ante, at 14. If the jury had been
instructed to measure the material by Rockford, Illinois, standards,
I might agree. It was instructed, however, to "judge whether the material was obscene by determining how it would be viewed by ordinary
adults in the whole State of Illinois," 481 U. S., at 499 (emphasis added)--
which includes, of course, the city of Chicago, that toddlin' town. A finding of obscenity under that standard amounts to a finding of obscenity
under a national ("reasonable person") standard. See id., at 504 (Scalia,
J., concurring).

Opinion of Scalia, J.
Asserting that "[u]nder our cases, a constitutional error iseither structural or it is not," ante, at 14, the Court criticizes

the Sullivan test for importing a "case-by-case approach"into the structural-error determination. If that were true,
it would seem a small price to pay for keeping the appellatefunction consistent with the Sixth Amendment. But in fact
the Court overstates the cut-and-dried nature of identifyingstructural error. Some structural errors, like the complete
absence of counsel or the denial of a public trial, are visibleat first glance. Others, like deciding whether the trial judge
was biased or whether there was racial discrimination in thegrand jury selection, require a more fact-intensive inquiry.
Deciding whether the jury made a finding "functionallyequivalent" to the omitted or misdescribed element is similar
to structural-error analysis of the latter sort.

III
The Court points out that all forms of harmless-error re-view "infringe upon the jury's factfinding role and affect the

jury's deliberative process in ways that are, strictly speak-ing, not readily calculable."

Ante, at 18. In finding, for ex-ample, that the jury's verdict would not have been affected

by the exclusion of evidence improperly admitted, or by theadmission of evidence improperly excluded, a court is speculating on what the jury would have found. See, e. g., Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U. S., at 296 (Would the verdicthave been different if a coerced confession had not been introduced?); Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U. S. 673, 684(1986) (Would the verdict have been different if evidence had
not been unconstitutionally barred from admission?). Thereis no difference, the Court asserts, in permitting a similar
speculation here. Ante, at 18.If this analysis were correct--if permitting speculation on
whether a jury would have changed its verdict logically de-mands permitting speculation on what verdict a jury would
have rendered--we ought to be able to uphold directed ver527US1 Unit: $U69 [05-01-01 18:41:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN
38 NEDER v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of Scalia, J.
dicts in cases where the defendant's guilt is absolutely clear.In other words, the Court's analysis is simply a repudiation

of the principle that depriving the criminal defendant of ajury verdict is

structural error. Sullivan v. Louisiana
clearly articulated the line between permissible and impermissible speculation that preserves the well-establishedstructural character of the jury-trial right and places a principled and discernible limitation upon judicial intervention:"The inquiry . . . is not whether, in a trial that occurred
without the error, a guilty verdict would surely have beenrendered, but whether the guilty verdict

actually rendered
in this trial was surely unattributable to the error." 508U. S., at 279 (emphasis added). Harmless-error review applies only when the jury actually renders a verdict--that is,
when it has found the defendant guilty of all the elements ofthe crime.

The difference between speculation directed toward
confirming the jury's verdict (Sullivan) and speculation directed toward making a judgment that the jury has never
made (today's decision) is more than semantic. Consider,
for example, the following scenarios. If I order for my wifein a restaurant, there is no sense in which the decision is

hers, even if I am sure beyond a reasonable doubt about what
she would have ordered. If, however, while she is away
from the table, I advise the waiter to stay with an order she
initially made, even though he informs me that there has
been a change in the accompanying dish, one can still say
that my wife placed the order--even if I am wrong about
whether she would have changed her mind in light of the
new information. Of course, I may predict correctly in both
instances simply because I know my wife well. I doubt,
however, that a low error rate would persuade my wife that
my making a practice of the first was a good idea.

It is this sort of allocation of decisionmaking power that
the Sullivan standard protects. The right to render the
verdict in criminal prosecutions belongs exclusively to the
jury; reviewing it belongs to the appellate court. "Confirm527US1 Unit: $U69 [05-01-01 18:41:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ing" speculation does not disturb that allocation, but "substi-tuting" speculation does. Make no mistake about the shift

in standard: Whereas Sullivan confined appellate courts totheir proper role of reviewing

verdicts, the Court today puts
appellate courts in the business of reviewing the defendant's
guilt. The Court does not--it cannot--reconcile this newapproach with the proposition that denial of the jury-trial

right is structural error.

* * *The recipe that has produced today's ruling consists of one

part self-esteem, one part panic, and one part pragmatism.
I have already commented upon the first ingredient: What
could possibly be so bad about having judges decide that a
jury would necessarily have found the defendant guilty?
Nothing except the distrust of judges that underlies the
jury-trial guarantee. As to the ingredient of panic: The
Court is concerned that the Sullivan approach will invalidate convictions in innumerable cases where the defendant
is obviously guilty. There is simply no basis for that concern. The limited harmless-error approach of Sullivan applies only when specific objection to the erroneous instruction has been made and rejected. In all other cases, the
Olano plain-error rule governs, which is similar to the ordinary harmless-error analysis that the Court would apply. I
doubt that the criminal cases in which instructions omit or
misdescribe elements of the offense over the objection of the
defendant are so numerous as to present a massive problem.
(If they are, the problem of vagueness in our criminal laws,
or of incompetence in our judges, makes the problem under
discussion here seem insignificant by comparison.)

And as for the ingredient of pragmatism (if the defendant
is unquestionably guilty, why go through the trouble of trying him again?), it suffices to quote Blackstone once again:

"[H]owever convenient [intrusions on the jury right]
may appear at first, (as, doubtless, all arbitrary powers,
well executed, are the most convenient,) yet let it be

again remembered that delays and little inconveniencesin the forms of justice are the price that all free nations

must pay for their liberty in more substantial matters;that these inroads upon this sacred bulwark of the nation are fundamentally opposite to the spirit of our con-stitution; and that, though begun in trifles, the precedent may gradually increase and spread to the utterdisuse of juries in questions of the most momentous concern." 4 Blackstone, Commentaries *350.
See also Bollenbach v. United States, 326 U. S. 607, 615(1946). Formal requirements are often scorned when they

stand in the way of expediency. This Court, however, hasan obligation to take a longer view. I respectfully dissent.

CITY OF CHICAGO v. MORALES et al.
certiorari to the supreme court of illinois
No. 97-1121. Argued December 9, 1998--Decided June 10, 1999
Chicago's Gang Congregation Ordinance prohibits "criminal street gang

members" from loitering in public places. Under the ordinance, if a
police officer observes a person whom he reasonably believes to be a
gang member loitering in a public place with one or more persons, he
shall order them to disperse. Anyone who does not promptly obey such
an order has violated the ordinance. The police department's General
Order 92-4 purports to limit officers' enforcement discretion by confining arrest authority to designated officers, establishing detailed criteria
for defining street gangs and membership therein, and providing for
designated, but publicly undisclosed, enforcement areas. Two trial
judges upheld the ordinance's constitutionality, but 11 others ruled it
invalid. The Illinois Appellate Court affirmed the latter cases and reversed the convictions in the former. The State Supreme Court affirmed, holding that the ordinance violates due process in that it is impermissibly vague on its face and an arbitrary restriction on personal
liberties.

Held: The judgment is affirmed.
177 Ill. 2d 440, 687 N. E. 2d 53, affirmed.

Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to
Parts I, II, and V, concluding that the ordinance's broad sweep violates
the requirement that a legislature establish minimal guidelines to govern law enforcement. Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U. S. 352, 358. The
ordinance encompasses a great deal of harmless behavior: In any public
place in Chicago, persons in the company of a gang member "shall" be
ordered to disperse if their purpose is not apparent to an officer. Moreover, the Illinois Supreme Court interprets the ordinance's loitering
definition--"to remain in any one place with no apparent purpose"--as
giving officers absolute discretion to determine what activities constitute loitering. See id., at 359. This Court has no authority to construe
the language of a state statute more narrowly than the State's highest
court. See Smiley v. Kansas, 196 U. S. 447, 455. The three features
of the ordinance that, the city argues, limit the officer's discretion--(1)
it does not permit issuance of a dispersal order to anyone who is moving
along or who has an apparent purpose; (2) it does not permit an arrest
if individuals obey a dispersal order; and (3) no order can issue unless
the officer reasonably believes that one of the loiterers is a gang mem527US1 Unit: $U70 [05-09-01 12:56:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ber--are insufficient. Finally, the Illinois Supreme Court is correct
that General Order 92-4 is not a sufficient limitation on police discretion.
See Smith v. Goguen, 415 U. S. 566, 575. Pp. 60-64.

Justice Stevens, joined by Justice Souter and Justice Ginsburg, concluded in Parts III, IV, and VI:

1. It was not improper for the state courts to conclude that the ordinance, which covers a significant amount of activity in addition to the
intimidating conduct that is its factual predicate, is invalid on its face.
An enactment may be attacked on its face as impermissibly vague if,
inter alia, it fails to establish standards for the police and public that
are sufficient to guard against the arbitrary deprivation of liberty. Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U. S., at 358. The freedom to loiter for innocent
purposes is part of such "liberty." See, e. g., Kent v. Dulles, 357 U. S.
116, 126. The ordinance's vagueness makes a facial challenge appropriate. This is not an enactment that simply regulates business behavior and contains a scienter requirement. See Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U. S. 489, 499. It is a criminal law that
contains no mens rea requirement, see Colautti v. Franklin, 439 U. S.
379, 395, and infringes on constitutionally protected rights, see id., at
391. Pp. 51-56.

2. Because the ordinance fails to give the ordinary citizen adequate
notice of what is forbidden and what is permitted, it is impermissibly
vague. See, e. g., Coates v. Cincinnati, 402 U. S. 611, 614. The term
"loiter" may have a common and accepted meaning, but the ordinance's
definition of that term--"to remain in any one place with no apparent
purpose"--does not. It is difficult to imagine how any Chicagoan
standing in a public place with a group of people would know if he or
she had an "apparent purpose." This vagueness about what loitering
is covered and what is not dooms the ordinance. The city's principal
response to the adequate notice concern--that loiterers are not subject
to criminal sanction until after they have disobeyed a dispersal order--
is unpersuasive for at least two reasons. First, the fair notice requirement's purpose is to enable the ordinary citizen to conform his or her
conduct to the law. See Lanzetta v. New Jersey, 306 U. S. 451, 453. A
dispersal order, which is issued only after prohibited conduct has
occurred, cannot retroactively provide adequate notice of the boundary
between the permissible and the impermissible applications of the ordinance. Second, the dispersal order's terms compound the inadequacy
of the notice afforded by the ordinance, which vaguely requires that the
officer "order all such persons to disperse and remove themselves from
the area," and thereby raises a host of questions as to the duration and
distinguishing features of the loiterers' separation. Pp. 56-60.

Justice O'Connor, joined by Justice Breyer, concluded that, as
construed by the Illinois Supreme Court, the Chicago ordinance is unconstitutionally vague because it lacks sufficient minimal standards to
guide law enforcement officers; in particular, it fails to provide any
standard by which police can judge whether an individual has an "apparent purpose." This vagueness alone provides a sufficient ground for
affirming the judgment below, and there is no need to consider the other
issues briefed by the parties and addressed by the plurality. It is important to courts and legislatures alike to characterize more clearly the
narrow scope of the Court's holding. Chicago still has reasonable alternatives to combat the very real threat posed by gang intimidation and
violence, including, e. g., adoption of laws that directly prohibit the congregation of gang members to intimidate residents, or the enforcement
of existing laws with that effect. Moreover, the ordinance could have
been construed more narrowly to avoid the vagueness problem, by, e. g.,
adopting limitations that restrict the ordinance's criminal penalties to
gang members or interpreting the term "apparent purpose" narrowly
and in light of the Chicago City Council's findings. This Court, however, cannot impose a limiting construction that a state supreme court
has declined to adopt. See, e. g., Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U. S. 352,
355-356, n. 4. The Illinois Supreme Court misapplied this Court's precedents, particularly Papachristou v. Jacksonville, 405 U. S. 156, to the
extent it read them as requiring it to hold the ordinance vague in all of
its applications. Pp. 64-69.

Justice Kennedy concluded that, as interpreted by the Illinois Supreme Court, the Chicago ordinance unconstitutionally reaches a broad
range of innocent conduct, and, therefore, is not necessarily saved by
the requirement that the citizen disobey a dispersal order before there
is a violation. Although it can be assumed that disobeying some police
commands will subject a citizen to prosecution whether or not the citizen knows why the order is given, it does not follow that any unexplained police order must be obeyed without notice of its lawfulness.
The predicate of a dispersal order is not sufficient to eliminate doubts
regarding the adequacy of notice under this ordinance. A citizen, while
engaging in a wide array of innocent conduct, is not likely to know when
he may be subject to such an order based on the officer's own knowledge
of the identity or affiliations of other persons with whom the citizen is
congregating; nor may the citizen be able to assess what an officer might
conceive to be the citizen's lack of an apparent purpose. Pp. 69-70.

Justice Breyer concluded that the ordinance violates the Constitution because it delegates too much discretion to the police, and it is not
saved by its limitations requiring that the police reasonably believe that
the person ordered to disperse (or someone accompanying him) is a gang

Syllabus
member, and that he remain in the public place "with no apparent purpose." Nor does it violate this Court's usual rules governing facial
challenges to forbid the city to apply the unconstitutional ordinance in
this case. There is no way to distinguish in the ordinance's terms between one application of unlimited police discretion and another. It is
unconstitutional, not because a policeman applied his discretion wisely
or poorly in a particular case, but rather because the policeman enjoys
too much discretion in every case. And if every application of the ordinance represents an exercise of unlimited discretion, then the ordinance
is invalid in all its applications. See Lanzetta v. New Jersey, 306 U. S.
451, 453. Contrary to Justice Scalia's suggestion, the ordinance does
not escape facial invalidation simply because it may provide fair warning
to some individual defendants that it prohibits the conduct in which
they are engaged. This ordinance is unconstitutional, not because it
provides insufficient notice, but because it does not provide sufficient
minimal standards to guide the police. See Coates v. Cincinnati, 402
U. S. 611, 614. Pp. 70-73.

members" from "loitering" with one another or with otherpersons in any public place. The question presented is

whether the Supreme Court of Illinois correctly held that theordinance violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment to the Federal Constitution.

I
Before the ordinance was adopted, the city council's Committee on Police and Fire conducted hearings to explore theproblems created by the city's street gangs, and more particularly, the consequences of public loitering by gang members. Witnesses included residents of the neighborhoodswhere gang members are most active, as well as some of the

aldermen who represent those areas. Based on that evi-dence, the council made a series of findings that are included
in the text of the ordinance and explain the reasons for its
enactment.1

The council found that a continuing increase in criminal
street gang activity was largely responsible for the city's rising murder rate, as well as an escalation of violent and drug
related crimes. It noted that in many neighborhoods
throughout the city, " `the burgeoning presence of street
gang members in public places has intimidated many law
abiding citizens.' " 177 Ill. 2d 440, 445, 687 N. E. 2d 53, 58
(1997). Furthermore, the council stated that gang members " `establish control over identifiable areas . . . by loitering in those areas and intimidating others from entering
those areas; and . . . [m]embers of criminal street gangs
avoid arrest by committing no offense punishable under existing laws when they know the police are present . . . .' "
Ibid. It further found that " `loitering in public places by

evidence supporting these findings is quoted in Justice Thomas' dissenting opinion. Post, at 100-101.

criminal street gang members creates a justifiable fear forthe safety of persons and property in the area' " and that

" `[a]ggressive action is necessary to preserve the city'sstreets and other public places so that the public may use
such places without fear.' " Moreover, the council concludedthat the city " `has an interest in discouraging all persons
from loitering in public places with criminal gang mem-bers.' "

Ibid.The ordinance creates a criminal offense punishable by a

fine of up to $500, imprisonment for not more than sixmonths, and a requirement to perform up to 120 hours of
community service. Commission of the offense involves fourpredicates. First, the police officer must reasonably believe
that at least one of the two or more persons present in a" `public place' " is a " `criminal street gang membe[r].' "
Second, the persons must be " `loitering,' " which the ordi-nance defines as " `remain[ing] in any one place with no
apparent purpose.' " Third, the officer must then order" `all' " of the persons to disperse and remove themselves
" `from the area.' " Fourth, a person must disobey the offi-cer's order. If any person, whether a gang member or not,
disobeys the officer's order, that person is guilty of violatingthe ordinance. Ibid.

2 The ordinance states in pertinent part:
"(a) Whenever a police officer observes a person whom he reasonably
believes to be a criminal street gang member loitering in any public place
with one or more other persons, he shall order all such persons to disperse
and remove themselves from the area. Any person who does not
promptly obey such an order is in violation of this section.

"(b) It shall be an affirmative defense to an alleged violation of this
section that no person who was observed loitering was in fact a member
of a criminal street gang.

"(c) As used in this Section:
"(1) `Loiter' means to remain in any one place with no apparent purpose.
"(2) `Criminal street gang' means any ongoing organization, association
in fact or group of three or more persons, whether formal or informal,
having as one of its substantial activities the commission of one or more
of the criminal acts enumerated in paragraph (3), and whose members

Opinion of the Court
Two months after the ordinance was adopted, the ChicagoPolice Department promulgated General Order 92-4 to provide guidelines to govern its enforcement.3 That order pur-ported to establish limitations on the enforcement discretion
of police officers "to ensure that the anti-gang loitering ordi-nance is not enforced in an arbitrary or discriminatory way."
Chicago Police Department, General Order 92-4, reprintedin App. to Pet. for Cert. 65a. The limitations confine the
authority to arrest gang members who violate the ordinanceto sworn "members of the Gang Crime Section" and certain
other designated officers,4 and establish detailed criteria fordefining street gangs and membership in such gangs.

Id.,at 66a-67a. In addition, the order directs district commanders to "designate areas in which the presence of gang mem-bers has a demonstrable effect on the activities of law abiding persons in the surrounding community," and providesthat the ordinance "will be enforced only within the desigindividually or collectively engage in or have engaged in a pattern of criminal gang activity.. . . . .

"(5) `Public place' means the public way and any other location open to
the public, whether publicly or privately owned.

"(e) Any person who violates this Section is subject to a fine of not less
than $100 and not more than $500 for each offense, or imprisonment for
not more than six months, or both.

"In addition to or instead of the above penalties, any person who violates
this section may be required to perform up to 120 hours of community
service pursuant to section 1-4-120 of this Code." Chicago Municipal
Code $ 8-4-015 (added June 17, 1992), reprinted in App. to Pet. for Cert.
61a-63a.

3 As the Illinois Supreme Court noted, during the hearings preceding

the adoption of the ordinance, "representatives of the Chicago law and
police departments informed the city counsel that any limitations on the
discretion police have in enforcing the ordinance would be best developed
through police policy, rather than placing such limitations into the ordinance itself." 177 Ill. 2d, at 446, 687 N. E. 2d, at 58-59.

4 Presumably, these officers would also be able to arrest all nongang

members who violate the ordinance.

release the locations of these "designated areas" to the
public.5

During the three years of its enforcement,6 the police issued over 89,000 dispersal orders and arrested over 42,000
people for violating the ordinance.7 In the ensuing enforcement proceedings, 2 trial judges upheld the constitutionality of the ordinance, but 11 others ruled that it was invalid.8 In respondent Youkhana's case, the trial judge held

The city believes that the ordinance resulted in a significant decline in
gang-related homicides. It notes that in 1995, the last year the ordinance
was enforced, the gang-related homicide rate fell by 26%. In 1996, after
the ordinance had been held invalid, the gang-related homicide rate rose
11%. Pet. for Cert. 9, n. 5. However, gang-related homicides fell by 19%
in 1997, over a year after the suspension of the ordinance. Daley & Hillard, at 5. Given the myriad factors that influence levels of violence, it is
difficult to evaluate the probative value of this statistical evidence, or to
reach any firm conclusion about the ordinance's efficacy. Cf. Harcourt,

is prohibited, and it encourages arbitrary and capricious enforcement by police." 9

The Illinois Appellate Court affirmed the trial court's ruling in the Youkhana case,10 consolidated and affirmed other

pending appeals in accordance with Youkhana,11 and reversed the convictions of respondents Gutierrez, Morales,
and others.12 The Appellate Court was persuaded that the
ordinance impaired the freedom of assembly of nongang
members in violation of the First Amendment to the Federal
Constitution and Article I of the Illinois Constitution, that it
was unconstitutionally vague, that it improperly criminalized
status rather than conduct, and that it jeopardized rights
guaranteed under the Fourth Amendment.13

The Illinois Supreme Court affirmed. It held "that the
gang loitering ordinance violates due process of law in that
it is impermissibly vague on its face and an arbitrary restriction on personal liberties." 177 Ill. 2d, at 447, 687 N. E.
2d, at 59. The court did not reach the contentions that the
ordinance "creates a status offense, permits arrests without
probable cause or is overbroad." Ibid.

In support of its vagueness holding, the court pointed out
that the definition of "loitering" in the ordinance drew no
distinction between innocent conduct and conduct calculated

that the ordinance improperly authorized arrest on the basis of a person's
status instead of conduct and that it was facially overbroad under the

Constitution. Id., at 59a.

III
The basic factual predicate for the city's ordinance is notin dispute. As the city argues in its brief, "the very presence of a large collection of obviously brazen, insistent, andlawless gang members and hangers-on on the public ways
intimidates residents, who become afraid even to leave theirhomes and go about their business. That, in turn, imperils
community residents' sense of safety and security, detractsfrom property values, and can ultimately destabilize entire
neighborhoods." 16 The findings in the ordinance explainthat it was motivated by these concerns. We have no doubt

14 "The ordinance defines `loiter' to mean `to remain in any one place
with no apparent purpose.' Chicago Municipal Code $ 8-4-015(c)(1)
(added June 17, 1992). People with entirely legitimate and lawful purposes will not always be able to make their purposes apparent to an observing police officer. For example, a person waiting to hail a taxi, resting on a corner during a jog, or stepping into a doorway to evade a rain
shower has a perfectly legitimate purpose in all these scenarios; however,
that purpose will rarely be apparent to an observer." 177 Ill. 2d, at 451-
452, 687 N. E. 2d, at 60-61.

15 It stated: "Although the proscriptions of the ordinance are vague, the

city council's intent in its enactment is clear and unambiguous. The city
has declared gang members a public menace and determined that gang
members are too adept at avoiding arrest for all the other crimes they
commit. Accordingly, the city council crafted an exceptionally broad ordinance which could be used to sweep these intolerable and objectionable
gang members from the city streets." Id., at 458, 687 N. E. 2d, at 64.

Opinion of Stevens, J.
that a law that directly prohibited such intimidating conductwould be constitutional,

17 but this ordinance broadly covers

a significant amount of additional activity. Uncertaintyabout the scope of that additional coverage provides the

basis for respondents' claim that the ordinance is too vague.We are confronted at the outset with the city's claim that
it was improper for the state courts to conclude that theordinance is invalid on its face. The city correctly points out
that imprecise laws can be attacked on their face under twodifferent doctrines.

18 First, the overbreadth doctrine permits the facial invalidation of laws that inhibit the exerciseof First Amendment rights if the impermissible applications

of the law are substantial when "judged in relation to thestatute's plainly legitimate sweep."

Broadrick v. Okla-homa, 413 U. S. 601, 612-615 (1973). Second, even if an

enactment does not reach a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct, it may be impermissibly vaguebecause it fails to establish standards for the police and public that are sufficient to guard against the arbitrary depriva-tion of liberty interests.

Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U. S. 352,
358 (1983).While we, like the Illinois courts, conclude that the ordinance is invalid on its face, we do not rely on the overbreadth
doctrine. We agree with the city's submission that the lawdoes not have a sufficiently substantial impact on conduct

17 In fact the city already has several laws that serve this purpose. See,
e. g., Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 720 $$ 5/12-6 (1998) (intimidation); 570/405.2
(streetgang criminal drug conspiracy); 147/1 et seq. (Illinois Streetgang
Terrorism Omnibus Prevention Act); 5/25-1 (mob action). Deputy Superintendent Cooper, the only representative of the police department at the
Committee on Police and Fire hearing on the ordinance, testified that, of
the kinds of behavior people had discussed at the hearing, "90 percent of
those instances are actually criminal offenses where people, in fact, can be
arrested." Record, Appendix II to plaintiff's Memorandum in Opposition
to Motion to Dismiss 182 (Tr. of Proceedings, Chicago City Council Committee on Police and Fire, May 18, 1992).

Opinion of Stevens, J.
protected by the First Amendment to render it unconstitu-tional. The ordinance does not prohibit speech. Because

the term "loiter" is defined as remaining in one place "withno apparent purpose," it is also clear that it does not prohibit
any form of conduct that is apparently intended to conveya message. By its terms, the ordinance is inapplicable to
assemblies that are designed to demonstrate a group's sup-port of, or opposition to, a particular point of view. Cf.
Clark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence, 468 U. S.288 (1984);

Gregory v. Chicago, 394 U. S. 111 (1969). Its im-pact on the social contact between gang members and others

does not impair the First Amendment "right of association"that our cases have recognized. See

Dallas v. Stanglin, 490U. S. 19, 23-25 (1989).

On the other hand, as the United States recognizes, thefreedom to loiter for innocent purposes is part of the "liberty" protected by the Due Process Clause of the FourteenthAmendment.

19 We have expressly identified this "right to

remove from one place to another according to inclination"as "an attribute of personal liberty" protected by the Constitution. Williams v. Fears, 179 U. S. 270, 274 (1900); see alsoPapachristou v. Jacksonville, 405 U. S. 156, 164 (1972).

19 See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 23: "We do not doubt
that, under the Due Process Clause, individuals in this country have significant liberty interests in standing on sidewalks and in other public
places, and in traveling, moving, and associating with others." The city
appears to agree, at least to the extent that such activities include "social
gatherings." Brief for Petitioner 21, n. 13. Both Justice Scalia, post,
at 83-86 (dissenting opinion), and Justice Thomas, post, at 102-106 (dissenting opinion), not only disagree with this proposition, but also incorrectly
assume (as the city does not, see Brief for Petitioner 44) that identification
of an obvious liberty interest that is impacted by a statute is equivalent
to finding a violation of substantive due process. See n. 35, infra.

While antiloitering ordinances have long existed in this country, their pedigree does not ensure their constitutionality. In 16th-century England,

Indeed, it is apparent that an individual's decision to remain
in a public place of his choice is as much a part of his liberty
as the freedom of movement inside frontiers that is "a part
of our heritage" Kent v. Dulles, 357 U. S. 116, 126 (1958),

Note, Homelessness in a Modern Urban Setting, 10 Ford. Urb. L. J. 749,
754, n. 17 (1982). In Papachristou we noted that many American vagrancy laws were patterned on these "Elizabethan poor laws." 405 U. S.,
at 161-162. These laws went virtually unchallenged in this country until
attorneys became widely available to the indigent following our decision
in Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335 (1963). See Recent Developments,
Constitutional Attacks on Vagrancy Laws, 20 Stan. L. Rev. 782, 783 (1968).
In addition, vagrancy laws were used after the Civil War to keep former
slaves in a state of quasi slavery. In 1865, for example, Alabama broadened its vagrancy statute to include " `any runaway, stubborn servant or
child' " and " `a laborer or servant who loiters away his time, or refuses
to comply with any contract for a term of service without just cause.' "
T. Wilson, Black Codes of the South 76 (1965). The Reconstruction-era
vagrancy laws had especially harsh consequences on African-American
women and children. L. Kerber, No Constitutional Right to be Ladies:
Women and the Obligations of Citizenship 50-69 (1998). Neither this history nor the scholarly compendia in Justice Thomas' dissent, post, at
102-106, persuades us that the right to engage in loitering that is entirely
harmless in both purpose and effect is not a part of the liberty protected
by the Due Process Clause.

21 The freewheeling and hypothetical character of Justice Scalia's discussion of liberty is epitomized by his assumption that citizens of Chicago,
who were once "free to drive about the city" at whatever speed they
wished, were the ones who decided to limit that freedom by adopting a
speed limit. Post, at 73. History tells quite a different story.

In 1903, the Illinois Legislature passed "An Act to regulate the speed
of automobiles and other horseless conveyances upon the public streets,
roads, and highways of the state of Illinois." That statute, with some
exceptions, set a speed limit of 15 miles per hour. See Christy v. Elliott,
216 Ill. 31, 74 N. E. 1035 (1905). In 1900, there were 1,698,575 citizens of
Chicago, 1 Twelfth Census of the United States 430 (1900) (Table 6), but

Opinion of Stevens, J.
There is no need, however, to decide whether the impactof the Chicago ordinance on constitutionally protected liberty alone would suffice to support a facial challenge underthe overbreadth doctrine. Cf. Aptheker v. Secretary of
State, 378 U. S. 500, 515-517 (1964) (right to travel); Planned
Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth, 428 U. S. 52, 82-83(1976) (abortion); Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U. S., at 355, n. 3,

358-360, and n. 9. For it is clear that the vagueness of thisenactment makes a facial challenge appropriate. This is not
an ordinance that "simply regulates business behavior andcontains a scienter requirement." See Hoffman Estates v.
Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U. S. 489, 499 (1982).It is a criminal law that contains no

mens rea requirement,see Colautti v. Franklin, 439 U. S. 379, 395 (1979), and infringes on constitutionally protected rights, see id., at 391.When vagueness permeates the text of such a law, it is
subject to facial attack.22
only 8,000 cars (both private and commercial) registered in the entire
United States. See Ward's Automotive Yearbook 230 (1990). Even
though the number of cars in the country had increased to 77,400 by 1905,
ibid., it seems quite clear that it was pedestrians, rather than drivers, who
were primarily responsible for Illinois' decision to impose a speed limit.

22 The burden of the first portion of Justice Scalia's dissent is virtually

a facial challenge to the facial challenge doctrine. See post, at 74-83. He
first lauds the "clarity of our general jurisprudence" in the method for
assessing facial challenges and then states that the clear import of our
cases is that, in order to mount a successful facial challenge, a plaintiff
must "establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act
would be valid." See post, at 78-79 (emphasis deleted); United States v.
Salerno, 481 U. S. 739, 745 (1987). To the extent we have consistently
articulated a clear standard for facial challenges, it is not the Salerno
formulation, which has never been the decisive factor in any decision of
this Court, including Salerno itself (even though the defendants in that
case did not claim that the statute was unconstitutional as applied to them,
see id., at 745, n. 3, the Court nevertheless entertained their facial challenge). Since we, like the Illinois Supreme Court, conclude that vagueness permeates the ordinance, a facial challenge is appropriate.

We need not, however, resolve the viability of Salerno's dictum, because
this case comes to us from a state--not a federal--court. When asserting

Opinion of Stevens, J.
Vagueness may invalidate a criminal law for either of twoindependent reasons. First, it may fail to provide the kind

of notice that will enable ordinary people to understand whatconduct it prohibits; second, it may authorize and even
encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. See
Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U. S., at 357. Accordingly, wefirst consider whether the ordinance provides fair notice to

the citizen and then discuss its potential for arbitraryenforcement.

"It is established that a law fails to meet the requirementsof the Due Process Clause if it is so vague and standardless

that it leaves the public uncertain as to the conduct it prohib-its . . . ."

Giaccio v. Pennsylvania, 382 U. S. 399, 402-403(1966). The Illinois Supreme Court recognized that the

term "loiter" may have a common and accepted meaning, 177Ill. 2d, at 451, 687 N. E. 2d, at 61, but the definition of that
term in this ordinance--"to remain in any one place with noapparent purpose"--does not. It is difficult to imagine how

a facial challenge, a party seeks to vindicate not only his own rights, but
those of others who may also be adversely impacted by the statute in
question. In this sense, the threshold for facial challenges is a species of
third party (jus tertii) standing, which we have recognized as a prudential
doctrine and not one mandated by Article III of the Constitution. See
Secretary of State of Md. v. Joseph H. Munson Co., 467 U. S. 947, 955
(1984). When a state court has reached the merits of a constitutional
claim, "invoking prudential limitations on [the respondent's] assertion of
jus tertii would serve no functional purpose." City of Revere v. Massachusetts Gen. Hospital, 463 U. S. 239, 243 (1983) (internal quotation
marks omitted).

Whether or not it would be appropriate for federal courts to apply the
Salerno standard in some cases--a proposition which is doubtful--state
courts need not apply prudential notions of standing created by this Court.
See ASARCO Inc. v. Kadish, 490 U. S. 605, 618 (1989). Justice Scalia's
assumption that state courts must apply the restrictive Salerno test is
incorrect as a matter of law; moreover it contradicts "essential principles
of federalism." See Dorf, Facial Challenges to State and Federal Statutes, 46 Stan. L. Rev. 235, 284 (1994).

any citizen of the city of Chicago standing in a public place
with a group of people would know if he or she had an "apparent purpose." If she were talking to another person,
would she have an apparent purpose? If she were frequently checking her watch and looking expectantly down
the street, would she have an apparent purpose? 23

Since the city cannot conceivably have meant to criminalize each instance a citizen stands in public with a gang member, the vagueness that dooms this ordinance is not the product of uncertainty about the normal meaning of "loitering,"
but rather about what loitering is covered by the ordinance
and what is not. The Illinois Supreme Court emphasized
the law's failure to distinguish between innocent conduct and
conduct threatening harm.24 Its decision followed the precedent set by a number of state courts that have upheld ordinances that criminalize loitering combined with some other
overt act or evidence of criminal intent.25 However, state

23 The Solicitor General, while supporting the city's argument that the
ordinance is constitutional, appears to recognize that the ordinance cannot
be read literally without invoking intractable vagueness concerns. "[T]he
purpose simply to stand on a corner cannot be an `apparent purpose' under
the ordinance; if it were, the ordinance would prohibit nothing at all."

invalidated the ordinance gave the following illustration: "Suppose a group
of gang members were playing basketball in the park, while waiting for a
drug delivery. Their apparent purpose is that they are in the park to
play ball. The actual purpose is that they are waiting for drugs. Under
this definition of loitering, a group of people innocently sitting in a park
discussing their futures would be arrested, while the `basketball players'
awaiting a drug delivery would be left alone." Chicago v. Youkhana, Nos.

Opinion of Stevens, J.
courts have uniformly invalidated laws that do not join theterm "loitering" with a second specific element of the

crime.26The city's principal response to this concern about adequate notice is that loiterers are not subject to sanction untilafter they have failed to comply with an officer's order to
disperse. "[W]hatever problem is created by a law thatcriminalizes conduct people normally believe to be innocent
is solved when persons receive actual notice from a policeorder of what they are expected to do."

27 We find this response unpersuasive for at least two reasons.First, the purpose of the fair notice requirement is to enable the ordinary citizen to conform his or her conduct to thelaw. "No one may be required at peril of life, liberty or
property to speculate as to the meaning of penal statutes."
Lanzetta v. New Jersey, 306 U. S. 451, 453 (1939). Although
it is true that a loiterer is not subject to criminal sanctionsunless he or she disobeys a dispersal order, the loitering is

the conduct that the ordinance is designed to prohibit.28 Ifthe loitering is in fact harmless and innocent, the dispersal
order itself is an unjustified impairment of liberty. If thepolice are able to decide arbitrarily which members of the
public they will order to disperse, then the Chicago ordi-nance becomes indistinguishable from the law we held invalid in Shuttlesworth v. Birmingham, 382 U. S. 87, 90

26 See, e. g., State v. Richard, 108 Nev. 626, 627, n. 2, 836 P. 2d 622, 623,
n. 2 (1992) (striking down statute that made it unlawful "for any person to
loiter or prowl upon the property of another without lawful business with
the owner or occupant thereof").

28 In this way, the ordinance differs from the statute upheld in Colten v.

Kentucky, 407 U. S. 104, 110 (1972). There, we found that the illegality
of the underlying conduct was clear. "Any person who stands in a group
of persons along a highway where the police are investigating a traffic
violation and seeks to engage the attention of an officer issuing a summons
should understand that he could be convicted under . . . Kentucky's statute
if he fails to obey an order to move on." Ibid.

Opinion of Stevens, J.
(1965).29 Because an officer may issue an order only afterprohibited conduct has already occurred, it cannot provide

the kind of advance notice that will protect the putative loi-terer from being ordered to disperse. Such an order cannot
retroactively give adequate warning of the boundary be-tween the permissible and the impermissible applications of
the law.30Second, the terms of the dispersal order compound the inadequacy of the notice afforded by the ordinance. It pro-vides that the officer "shall order all such persons to disperse
and remove themselves from the area." App. to Pet. forCert. 61a. This vague phrasing raises a host of questions.
After such an order issues, how long must the loiterers re-main apart? How far must they move? If each loiterer
walks around the block and they meet again at the samelocation, are they subject to arrest or merely to being ordered to disperse again? As we do here, we have foundvagueness in a criminal statute exacerbated by the use of
the standards of "neighborhood" and "locality." Connally v.
General Constr. Co., 269 U. S. 385 (1926). We remarked in
Connally that "[b]oth terms are elastic and, dependent uponcircumstances, may be equally satisfied by areas measured

by rods or by miles." Id., at 395.

Lack of clarity in the description of the loiterer's duty toobey a dispersal order might not render the ordinance uncon29 "Literally read . . . this ordinance says that a person may stand on a
public sidewalk in Birmingham only at the whim of any police officer of
that city. The constitutional vice of so broad a provision needs no demonstration." 382 U. S., at 90.

30 As we have noted in a similar context: "If petitioners were held guilty

of violating the Georgia statute because they disobeyed the officers, this
case falls within the rule that a generally worded statute which is construed to punish conduct which cannot constitutionally be punished is unconstitutionally vague to the extent that it fails to give adequate warning
of the boundary between the constitutionally permissible and constitutionally impermissible applications of the statute." Wright v. Georgia, 373
U. S. 284, 292 (1963).

Opinion of the Court
stitutionally vague if the definition of the forbidden conductwere clear, but it does buttress our conclusion that the entire

ordinance fails to give the ordinary citizen adequate noticeof what is forbidden and what is permitted. The Constitution does not permit a legislature to "set a net large enoughto catch all possible offenders, and leave it to the courts to
step inside and say who could be rightfully detained, andwho should be set at large."

United States v. Reese, 92 U. S.214, 221 (1876). This ordinance is therefore vague "not in

the sense that it requires a person to conform his conductto an imprecise but comprehensible normative standard, but
rather in the sense that no standard of conduct is specifiedat all."

Coates v. Cincinnati, 402 U. S. 611, 614 (1971).

V
The broad sweep of the ordinance also violates " `the re-quirement that a legislature establish minimal guidelines to

govern law enforcement.' " Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U. S.,at 358. There are no such guidelines in the ordinance. In
any public place in the city of Chicago, persons who stand orsit in the company of a gang member may be ordered to
disperse unless their purpose is apparent. The mandatorylanguage in the enactment directs the police to issue an order
without first making any inquiry about their possible pur-poses. It matters not whether the reason that a gang member and his father, for example, might loiter near WrigleyField is to rob an unsuspecting fan or just to get a glimpse
of Sammy Sosa leaving the ballpark; in either event, if theirpurpose is not apparent to a nearby police officer, she may--
indeed, she "shall"--order them to disperse.Recognizing that the ordinance does reach a substantial
amount of innocent conduct, we turn, then, to its languageto determine if it "necessarily entrusts lawmaking to the
moment-to-moment judgment of the policeman on his beat."
Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U. S., at 360 (internal quotationmarks omitted). As we discussed in the context of fair no527US1 Unit: $U70 [05-09-01 12:56:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN

61Cite as: 527 U. S. 41 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
tice, see supra, at 56-60, the principal source of the vastdiscretion conferred on the police in this case is the definition

of loitering as "to remain in any one place with no apparentpurpose."

As the Illinois Supreme Court interprets that definition, it"provides absolute discretion to police officers to decide what
activities constitute loitering." 177 Ill. 2d, at 457, 687 N. E.2d, at 63. We have no authority to construe the language
of a state statute more narrowly than the construction givenby that State's highest court.

31 "The power to determine

the meaning of a statute carries with it the power to prescribe its extent and limitations as well as the method bywhich they shall be determined."

Smiley v. Kansas, 196
U. S. 447, 455 (1905).Nevertheless, the city disputes the Illinois Supreme

Court's interpretation, arguing that the text of the ordinance
limits the officer's discretion in three ways. First, it doesnot permit the officer to issue a dispersal order to anyone

who is moving along or who has an apparent purpose. Sec-ond, it does not permit an arrest if individuals obey a dispersal order. Third, no order can issue unless the officerreasonably believes that one of the loiterers is a member of
a criminal street gang.Even putting to one side our duty to defer to a state court's
construction of the scope of a local enactment, we find each
of these limitations insufficient. That the ordinance doesnot apply to people who are moving--that is, to activity that

would not constitute loitering under any possible definition ofthe term--does not even address the question of how much
discretion the police enjoy in deciding which stationary per31 This critical fact distinguishes this case from Boos v. Barry, 485 U. S.
312, 329-330 (1988). There, we noted that the text of the relevant statute,
read literally, may have been void for vagueness both on notice and on
discretionary enforcement grounds. We then found, however, that the
Court of Appeals had "provided a narrowing construction that alleviates
both of these difficulties." Ibid.

Opinion of the Court
sons to disperse under the ordinance.32 Similarly, that theordinance does not permit an arrest until after a dispersal

order has been disobeyed does not provide any guidance tothe officer deciding whether such an order should issue.
The "no apparent purpose" standard for making that deci-sion is inherently subjective because its application depends
on whether some purpose is "apparent" to the officer on thescene.

Presumably an officer would have discretion to treat somepurposes--perhaps a purpose to engage in idle conversation
or simply to enjoy a cool breeze on a warm evening--as toofrivolous to be apparent if he suspected a different ulterior
motive. Moreover, an officer conscious of the city council'sreasons for enacting the ordinance might well ignore its text
and issue a dispersal order, even though an illicit purpose isactually apparent.

It is true, as the city argues, that the requirement that theofficer reasonably believe that a group of loiterers contains a
gang member does place a limit on the authority to orderdispersal. That limitation would no doubt be sufficient if
the ordinance only applied to loitering that had an apparentlyharmful purpose or effect,

33 or possibly if it only applied to

loitering by persons reasonably believed to be criminal gangmembers. But this ordinance, for reasons that are not explained in the findings of the city council, requires no harmfulpurpose and applies to nongang members as well as suspected gang members.34 It applies to everyone in the city

32 It is possible to read the mandatory language of the ordinance and
conclude that it affords the police no discretion, since it speaks with the
mandatory "shall." However, not even the city makes this argument,
which flies in the face of common sense that all police officers must use
some discretion in deciding when and where to enforce city ordinances.

33 Justice Thomas' dissent overlooks the important distinction between

this ordinance and those that authorize the police "to order groups of individuals who threaten the public peace to disperse." See post, at 107.

34 Not all of the respondents in this case, for example, are gang members.

The city admits that it was unable to prove that Morales is a gang member
but justifies his arrest and conviction by the fact that Morales admitted

Opinion of the Court
who may remain in one place with one suspected gang member as long as their purpose is not apparent to an officer
observing them. Friends, relatives, teachers, counselors, or
even total strangers might unwittingly engage in forbidden
loitering if they happen to engage in idle conversation with
a gang member.

Ironically, the definition of loitering in the Chicago ordinance not only extends its scope to encompass harmless conduct, but also has the perverse consequence of excluding
from its coverage much of the intimidating conduct that motivated its enactment. As the city council's findings demonstrate, the most harmful gang loitering is motivated either
by an apparent purpose to publicize the gang 's dominance of
certain territory, thereby intimidating nonmembers, or by an
equally apparent purpose to conceal ongoing commerce in
illegal drugs. As the Illinois Supreme Court has not placed
any limiting construction on the language in the ordinance,
we must assume that the ordinance means what it says and
that it has no application to loiterers whose purpose is apparent. The relative importance of its application to harmless
loitering is magnified by its inapplicability to loitering that
has an obviously threatening or illicit purpose.

Finally, in its opinion striking down the ordinance, the Illinois Supreme Court refused to accept the general order issued by the police department as a sufficient limitation on
the "vast amount of discretion" granted to the police in its
enforcement. We agree. See Smith v. Goguen, 415 U. S.
566, 575 (1974). That the police have adopted internal rules
limiting their enforcement to certain designated areas in the
city would not provide a defense to a loiterer who might be
arrested elsewhere. Nor could a person who knowingly loitered with a well-known gang member anywhere in the city

"that he knew he was with criminal street gang members." Reply Brief

charged in a document that only accused them of being in the presence of
a gang member. Tr. of Oral Arg. 34, 58.

In our judgment, the Illinois Supreme Court correctly con-cluded that the ordinance does not provide sufficiently specific limits on the enforcement discretion of the police "tomeet constitutional standards for definiteness and clarity."

177 Ill. 2d, at 459, 687 N. E. 2d, at 64. We recognize theserious and difficult problems testified to by the citizens of

Chicago that led to the enactment of this ordinance. "Weare mindful that the preservation of liberty depends in part
on the maintenance of social order." Houston v. Hill, 482U. S. 451, 471-472 (1987). However, in this instance the city
has enacted an ordinance that affords too much discretion tothe police and too little notice to citizens who wish to use the
public streets.Accordingly, the judg ment of the Supreme Court of
Illinois is Affirmed.

Justice O'Connor, with whom Justice Breyer joins,concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.
I agree with the Court that Chicago's Gang CongregationOrdinance, Chicago Municipal Code $ 8-4-015 (1992) (gang
loitering ordinance or ordinance) is unconstitutionally vague.A penal law is void for vagueness if it fails to "define the
criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinarypeople can understand what conduct is prohibited" or fails to

35 This conclusion makes it unnecessary to reach the question whether
the Illinois Supreme Court correctly decided that the ordinance is invalid
as a deprivation of substantive due process. For this reason, Justice
Thomas, see post, at 102-106, and Justice Scalia, see post, at 85-86, are
mistaken when they assert that our decision must be analyzed under the
framework for substantive due process set out in Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U. S. 702 (1997).

establish guidelines to prevent "arbitrary and discriminatoryenforcement" of the law.

Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U. S. 352,
357 (1983). Of these, "the more important aspect of thevagueness doctrine `is . . . the requirement that a legislature

establish minimal guidelines to govern law enforcement.' "
Id., at 358 (quoting Smith v. Goguen, 415 U. S. 566, 574-575(1974)). I share

Justice Thomas' concern about the consequences of gang violence, and I agree that some degreeof police discretion is necessary to allow the police "to

perform their peacekeeping responsibilities satisfactorily."
Post, at 109 (dissenting opinion). A criminal law, however,
must not permit policemen, prosecutors, and juries to con-duct " `a standardless sweep . . . to pursue their personal

predilections.' " Kolender v. Lawson, supra, at 358 (quoting
Smith v. Goguen, supra, at 575).The ordinance at issue provides:

"Whenever a police officer observes a person whom he
reasonably believes to be a criminal street gang member
loitering in any public place with one or more other per-sons, he shall order all such persons to disperse and remove themselves from the area. Any person who doesnot promptly obey such an order is in violation of this
section." App. to Pet. for Cert. 61a.
To "[l]oiter," in turn, is defined in the ordinance as "to remain in any one place with no apparent purpose." Ibid.The Illinois Supreme Court declined to adopt a limiting construction of the ordinance and concluded that the ordinancevested "

absolute discretion to police officers." 177 Ill. 2d
440, 457, 687 N. E. 2d 53, 63 (1997) (emphasis added). This
Court is bound by the Illinois Supreme Court's construction
of the ordinance. See Terminiello v. Chicago, 337 U. S. 1,
4 (1949).

As it has been construed by the Illinois court, Chicago's
gang loitering ordinance is unconstitutionally vague because
it lacks sufficient minimal standards to guide law enforce527US1 Unit: $U70 [05-09-01 12:56:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN
66 CHICAGO v. MORALES

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
ment officers. In particular, it fails to provide police withany standard by which they can judge whether an individual

has an "apparent purpose." Indeed, because any personstanding on the street has a general "purpose"--even if it is
simply to stand--the ordinance permits police officers to
choose which purposes are permissible. Under this con-struction the police do not have to decide that an individual

is "threaten[ing] the public peace" to issue a dispersal order.See

post, at 107 (Thomas, J., dissenting). Any police officer
in Chicago is free, under the Illinois Supreme Court's con-struction of the ordinance, to order at his whim any person

standing in a public place with a suspected gang member to
disperse. Further, as construed by the Illinois court, the
ordinance applies to hundreds of thousands of persons who
are not gang members, standing on any sidewalk or in any
park, coffee shop, bar, or "other location open to the public,
whether publicly or privately owned." Chicago Municipal
Code $ 8-4-015(c)(5) (1992).

To be sure, there is no violation of the ordinance unless a
person fails to obey promptly the order to disperse. But, a
police officer cannot issue a dispersal order until he decides
that a person is remaining in one place "with no apparent
purpose," and the ordinance provides no guidance to the officer on how to make this antecedent decision. Moreover,
the requirement that police issue dispersal orders only when
they "reasonably believ[e]" that a group of loiterers includes
a gang member fails to cure the ordinance's vague aspects.
If the ordinance applied only to persons reasonably believed
to be gang members, this requirement might have cured the
ordinance's vagueness because it would have directed the
manner in which the order was issued by specifying to whom
the order could be issued. Cf. ante, at 62. But, the Illinois
Supreme Court did not construe the ordinance to be so limited. See 177 Ill. 2d, at 453-454, 687 N. E. 2d, at 62.

This vagueness consideration alone provides a sufficient
ground for affirming the Illinois court's decision, and I agree

with Part V of the Court's opinion, which discusses this con-sideration. See

ante, at 62 ("[T]hat the ordinance does not
permit an arrest until after a dispersal order has been dis-obeyed does not provide any guidance to the officer deciding

whether such an order should issue"); ibid. ("It is true . . .
that the requirement that the officer reasonably believe thata group of loiterers contains a gang member does place a

limit on the authority to order dispersal. That limitationwould no doubt be sufficient if the ordinance only applied to
loitering that had an apparently harmful purpose or effect, orpossibly if it only applied to loitering by persons reasonably
believed to be criminal gang members"). Accordingly, there
is no need to consider the other issues briefed by the parties
and addressed by the plurality. I express no opinion about
them.

It is important to courts and legislatures alike that we
characterize more clearly the narrow scope of today's holding. As the ordinance comes to this Court, it is unconstitutionally vague. Nevertheless, there remain open to Chicago
reasonable alternatives to combat the very real threat posed
by gang intimidation and violence. For example, the Court
properly and expressly distinguishes the ordinance from
laws that require loiterers to have a "harmful purpose," see
ibid., from laws that target only gang members, see ibid.,
and from laws that incorporate limits on the area and manner
in which the laws may be enforced, see ante, at 62-63. In
addition, the ordinance here is unlike a law that "directly
prohibit[s]" the " `presence of a large collection of obviously
brazen, insistent, and lawless gang members and hangers-on
on the public ways,' " that " `intimidates residents.' " Ante,
at 51, 52 (quoting Brief for Petitioner 14). Indeed, as the
plurality notes, the city of Chicago has several laws that do
exactly this. See ante, at 52, n. 17. Chicago has even
enacted a provision that "enables police officers to fulfill . . .
their traditional functions," including "preserving the public
peace." See post, at 106 (Thomas, J., dissenting). Specifi527US1 Unit: $U70 [05-09-01 12:56:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN

cally, Chicago's general disorderly conduct provision allows
the police to arrest those who knowingly "provoke, make or
aid in making a breach of peace." See Chicago Municipal
Code $ 8-4-010 (1992).

In my view, the gang loitering ordinance could have been
construed more narrowly. The term "loiter" might possibly
be construed in a more limited fashion to mean "to remain
in any one place with no apparent purpose other than to establish control over identifiable areas, to intimidate others
from entering those areas, or to conceal illegal activities."
Such a definition would be consistent with the Chicago City
Council's findings and would avoid the vagueness problems
of the ordinance as construed by the Illinois Supreme Court.
See App. to Pet. for Cert. 60a-61a. As noted above, so
would limitations that restricted the ordinance's criminal
penalties to gang members or that more carefully delineated
the circumstances in which those penalties would apply to
nongang members.

The Illinois Supreme Court did not choose to give a limiting construction to Chicago's ordinance. To the extent it
relied on our precedents, particularly Papachristou v. Jacksonville, 405 U. S. 156 (1972), as requiring it to hold the
ordinance vague in all of its applications because it was intentionally drafted in a vague manner, the Illinois court
misapplied our precedents. See 177 Ill. 2d, at 458-459, 687
N. E. 2d, at 64. This Court has never held that the intent
of the drafters determines whether a law is vague. Nevertheless, we cannot impose a limiting construction that a state
supreme court has declined to adopt. See Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U. S., at 355-356, n. 4 (noting that the Court has
held that " `[f]or the purpose of determining whether a
state statute is too vague and indefinite to constitute valid
legislation we must take the statute as though it read precisely as the highest court of the State has interpreted it' "

Justice Kennedy, concurring in part and concurring inthe judgment.

I join Parts I, II, and V of the Court's opinion and concurin the judgment.
I also share many of the concerns Justice Stevensexpresses in Part IV with respect to the sufficiency of notice under the ordinance. As interpreted by the IllinoisSupreme Court, the Chicago ordinance would reach a broad
range of innocent conduct. For this reason it is not necessarily saved by the requirement that the citizen must dis-obey a police order to disperse before there is a violation.

We have not often examined these types of orders. Cf.
Shuttlesworth v. Birmingham, 382 U. S. 87 (1965). It can be
assumed, however, that some police commands will subject acitizen to prosecution for disobeying whether or not the citizen knows why the order is given. Illustrative examplesinclude when the police tell a pedestrian not to enter a building and the reason is to avoid impeding a rescue team, or to
protect a crime scene, or to secure an area for the protectionof a public official. It does not follow, however, that any

unexplained police order must be obeyed without notice ofthe lawfulness of the order. The predicate of an order to
disperse is not, in my view, sufficient to eliminate doubtsregarding the adequacy of notice under this ordinance. A
citizen, while engaging in a wide array of innocent conduct,is not likely to know when he may be subject to a dispersal
order based on the officer's own knowledge of the identity
or affiliations of other persons with whom the citizen is con527US1 Unit: $U70 [05-09-01 12:56:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN

gregating; nor may the citizen be able to assess what an offi-cer might conceive to be the citizen's lack of an apparent

purpose.

Justice Breyer, concurring in part and concurring inthe judgment.

The ordinance before us creates more than a "minor limi-tation upon the free state of nature." Post, at 74 (

Scalia,J., dissenting) (emphasis added). The law authorizes a police

officer to order any person to remove himself from any "loca-tion open to the public, whether publicly or privately
owned," Chicago Municipal Code $ 8-4-015(c)(5) (1992), i. e.,any sidewalk, front stoop, public park, public square, lakeside
promenade, hotel, restaurant, bowling alley, bar, barbershop,sports arena, shopping mall, etc., but with two, and only two,
limitations: First, that person must be accompanied by (ormust himself be) someone police reasonably believe is a gang
member. Second, that person must have remained in thatpublic place "with no apparent purpose." $ 8-4-015(c)(1).

The first limitation cannot save the ordinance. Though itlimits the number of persons subject to the law, it leaves
many individuals, gang members and nongang membersalike, subject to its strictures. Nor does it limit in any way
the range of conduct that police may prohibit. The secondlimitation is, as the Court, ante, at 62, and

Justice O'Connor, ante, at 65-66 (opinion concurring in part and concur-ring in judgment), point out, not a limitation at all. Since

one always has some apparent purpose, the so-called limita-tion invites, in fact requires, the policeman to interpret the
words "no apparent purpose" as meaning "no apparent purpose except for . . . ." And it is in the ordinance's delegationto the policeman of open-ended discretion to fill in that blank

that the problem lies. To grant to a policeman virtuallystandardless discretion to close off major portions of the city
to an innocent person is, in my view, to create a major, nota "minor," "limitation upon the free state of nature."

Opinion of Breyer, J.
Nor does it violate "our rules governing facial challenges,"
post, at 74 (Scalia, J., dissenting), to forbid the city to apply
the unconstitutional ordinance in this case. The reason why
the ordinance is invalid explains how that is so. As I have
said, I believe the ordinance violates the Constitution because it delegates too much discretion to a police officer to
decide whom to order to move on, and in what circumstances.
And I see no way to distinguish in the ordinance's terms
between one application of that discretion and another. The
ordinance is unconstitutional, not because a policeman applied this discretion wisely or poorly in a particular case, but
rather because the policeman enjoys too much discretion in
every case. And if every application of the ordinance represents an exercise of unlimited discretion, then the ordinance
is invalid in all its applications. The city of Chicago may be
able validly to apply some other law to the defendants in
light of their conduct. But the city of Chicago may no more
apply this law to the defendants, no matter how they behaved, than it could apply an (imaginary) statute that said,
"It is a crime to do wrong," even to the worst of murderers.
See Lanzetta v. New Jersey, 306 U. S. 451, 453 (1939) ("If on
its face the challenged provision is repugnant to the due
process clause, specification of details of the offense intended
to be charged would not serve to validate it").

Justice Scalia's examples, post, at 81-83, reach a different conclusion because they assume a different basis for the
law's constitutional invalidity. A statute, for example, might
not provide fair warning to many, but an individual defendant might still have been aware that it prohibited the conduct in which he engaged. Cf., e. g., Parker v. Levy, 417
U. S. 733, 756 (1974) ("[O]ne who has received fair warning
of the criminality of his own conduct from the statute in
question is [not] entitled to attack it because the language
would not give similar fair warning with respect to other
conduct which might be within its broad and literal ambit.

72 CHICAGO v. MORALES

Opinion of Breyer, J.
One to whose conduct a statute clearly applies may not successfully challenge it for vagueness"). But I believe this
ordinance is unconstitutional, not because it provides insufficient notice, but because it does not provide "sufficient minimal standards to guide law enforcement officers." See ante,
at 65-66 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring
in judgment).

I concede that this case is unlike those First Amendment
"overbreadth" cases in which this Court has permitted a facial challenge. In an overbreadth case, a defendant whose
conduct clearly falls within the law and may be constitutionally prohibited can nonetheless have the law declared facially
invalid to protect the rights of others (whose protected
speech might otherwise be chilled). In the present case, the
right that the defendants assert, the right to be free from
the officer's exercise of unchecked discretion, is more clearly
their own.

This case resembles Coates v. Cincinnati, 402 U. S. 611
(1971), where this Court declared facially unconstitutional
on, among other grounds, the due process standard of vagueness an ordinance that prohibited persons assembled on a
sidewalk from "conduct[ing] themselves in a manner annoying to persons passing by." The Court explained:

"It is said that the ordinance is broad enough to encompass many types of conduct clearly within the city's
constitutional power to prohibit. And so, indeed, it is.
The city is free to prevent people from blocking sidewalks, obstructing traffic, littering streets, committing
assaults, or engaging in countless other forms of antisocial conduct. It can do so through the enactment and
enforcement of ordinances directed with reasonable
specificity toward the conduct to be prohibited. . . . It
cannot constitutionally do so through the enactment and
enforcement of an ordinance whose violation may entirely depend upon whether or not a policeman is annoyed." Id., at 614 (citation omitted).

The ordinance in Coates could not constitutionally be appliedwhether or not the conduct of the particular defendants was

indisputably "annoying" or of a sort that a different, morespecific ordinance could constitutionally prohibit. Similarly,
here the city might have enacted a different ordinance, orthe Illinois Supreme Court might have interpreted this ordinance differently. And the Constitution might well havepermitted the city to apply that different ordinance (or this
ordinance as interpreted differently) to circumstances likethose present here. See

ante, at 67-68 (O'Connor, J., con-curring in part and concurring in judgment). But this ordinance, as I have said, cannot be constitutionally applied toanyone.

Justice Scalia, dissenting.
The citizens of Chicago were once free to drive about thecity at whatever speed they wished. At some point Chicagoans (or perhaps Illinoisans) decided this would not do, andimposed prophylactic speed limits designed to assure safe
operation by the average (or perhaps even subaverage)driver with the average (or perhaps even subaverage) vehicle. This infringed upon the "freedom" of all citizens, butwas not unconstitutional.

Similarly, the citizens of Chicago were once free to standaround and gawk at the scene of an accident. At some point
Chicagoans discovered that this obstructed traffic and causedmore accidents. They did not make the practice unlawful,
but they did authorize police officers to order the crowd todisperse, and imposed penalties for refusal to obey such an
order. Again, this prophylactic measure infringed upon the
"freedom" of all citizens, but was not unconstitutional.Until the ordinance that is before us today was adopted,

the citizens of Chicago were free to stand about in publicplaces with no apparent purpose--to engage, that is, in conduct that appeared to be loitering. In recent years, how-ever, the city has been afflicted with criminal street gangs.
As reflected in the record before us, these gangs congregated

527US1 Unit: $U70 [05-09-01 12:56:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Scalia, J., dissenting
in public places to deal in drugs, and to terrorize the neigh-borhoods by demonstrating control over their "turf." Many

residents of the inner city felt that they were prisoners intheir own homes. Once again, Chicagoans decided that to
eliminate the problem it was worth restricting some of thefreedom that they once enjoyed. The means they took was
similar to the second, and more mild, example given aboverather than the first: Loitering was not made unlawful, but
when a group of people occupied a public place without anapparent purpose and in the company of a known gang member, police officers were authorized to order them to disperse,and the failure to obey such an order was made unlawful.
See Chicago Municipal Code $ 8-4-015 (1992). The minorlimitation upon the free state of nature that this prophylactic
arrangement imposed upon all Chicagoans seemed to them(and it seems to me) a small price to pay for liberation of
their streets.The majority today invalidates this perfectly reasonable
measure by ignoring our rules governing facial challenges,by elevating loitering to a constitutionally guaranteed right,
and by discerning vagueness where, according to our usualstandards, none exists.

I
Respondents' consolidated appeal presents a facial chal-lenge to the Chicago ordinance on vagueness grounds.

When a facial challenge is successful, the law in question isdeclared to be unenforceable in all its applications, and not
just in its particular application to the party in suit. To tellthe truth, it is highly questionable whether federal courts
have any business making such a declaration. The rationalefor our power to review federal legislation for constitutionality, expressed in Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137 (1803),was that we

had to do so in order to decide the case beforeus. But that rationale only extends so far as to require us

to determine that the statute is unconstitutional as appliedto this party, in the circumstances of this case.

Scalia, J., dissenting
That limitation was fully grasped by Tocqueville, in his
famous chapter on the power of the judiciary in American
society:

"The second characteristic of judicial power is, that it
pronounces on special cases, and not upon general principles. If a judge, in deciding a particular point, destroys a general principle by passing a judgment which
tends to reject all the inferences from that principle, and
consequently to annul it, he remains within the ordinary
limits of his functions. But if he directly attacks a general principle without having a particular case in view,
he leaves the circle in which all nations have agreed to
confine his authority; he assumes a more important, and
perhaps a more useful influence, than that of the magistrate; but he ceases to represent the judicial power.. . . . .

"Whenever a law which the judge holds to be unconstitutional is invoked in a tribunal of the United States,
he may refuse to admit it as a rule . . . . But as soon as
a judge has refused to apply any given law in a case,
that law immediately loses a portion of its moral force.
Those to whom it is prejudicial learn that means exist
of overcoming its authority; and similar suits are multiplied, until it becomes powerless. . . . The political power
which the Americans have intrusted to their courts of
justice is therefore immense; but the evils of this power
are considerably diminished by the impossibility of attacking the laws except through the courts of justice. . . .
[W]hen a judge contests a law in an obscure debate on
some particular case, the importance of his attack is concealed from public notice; his decision bears upon the
interest of an individual, and the law is slighted only
incidentally. Moreover, although it is censured, it is not
abolished; its moral force may be diminished, but its authority is not taken away; and its final destruction can

(R. Heffner ed. 1956).
As Justice Sutherland described our system in his opinionfor a unanimous Court in

Massachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U. S.447, 488 (1923):

"We have no power per se to review and annul acts ofCongress on the ground that they are unconstitutional.
That question may be considered only when the justifi-cation for some direct injury suffered or threatened, presenting a justiciable issue, is made to rest upon such anact. Then the power exercised is that of ascertaining
and declaring the law applicable to the controversy. Itamounts to little more than the negative power to disregard an unconstitutional enactment, which otherwisewould stand in the way of the enforcement of a legal
right. . . . If a case for preventive relief be presented thecourt enjoins, in effect, not the execution of the statute,
but the acts of the official, the statute notwithstanding."
And as Justice Brennan described our system in his opinionfor a unanimous Court in

United States v. Raines, 362 U. S.17, 20-22 (1960):

"The very foundation of the power of the federalcourts to declare Acts of Congress unconstitutional lies
in the power and duty of those courts to decide casesand controversies before them. . . . This Court, as is the
case with all federal courts, `has no jurisdiction to pro-nounce any statute, either of a State or of the United
States, void, because irreconcilable with the Constitu-tion, except as it is called upon to adjudge the legal
rights of litigants in actual controversies. In the exer-cise of that jurisdiction, it is bound by two rules, to
which it has rigidly adhered, one, never to anticipate aquestion of constitutional law in advance of the necessity
of deciding it; the other never to formulate a rule of

constitutional law broader than is required by the pre-cise facts to which it is to be applied.' . . . Kindred to

these rules is the rule that one to whom application of astatute is constitutional will not be heard to attack the
statute on the ground that impliedly it might also betaken as applying to other persons or other situations in
which its application might be unconstitutional. . . . Thedelicate power of pronouncing an Act of Congress unconstitutional is not to be exercised with reference to hypo-thetical cases thus imagined."

It seems to me fundamentally incompatible with this sys-tem for the Court not to be content to find that a statute is
unconstitutional as applied to the person before it, but to gofurther and pronounce that the statute is unconstitutional in
all applications. Its reasoning may well suggest as much,but to pronounce a

holding on that point seems to me nomore than an advisory opinion--which a federal court should

never issue at all, see Hayburn's Case, 2 Dall. 409 (1792), and
especially should not issue with regard to a constitutionalquestion, as to which we seek to avoid even nonadvisory

opinions, see, e. g., Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U. S. 288, 347(1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring). I think it quite improper,
in short, to ask the constitutional claimant before us: Do youjust want us to say that this statute cannot constitutionally
be applied to you in this case, or do you want to go for brokeand try to get the statute pronounced void in all its
applications?I must acknowledge, however, that for some of the present
century we have done just this. But until recently, at least,we have--except in free-speech cases subject to the doctrine
of overbreadth, see, e. g., New York v. Ferber, 458 U. S. 747,769-773 (1982)--required the facial challenge to be a go-forbroke proposition. That is to say, before declaring a statuteto be void in all its applications (something we should not be
doing in the first place), we have at least imposed upon thelitigant the eminently reasonable requirement that he estab527US1 Unit: $U70 [05-09-01 12:56:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN

lish that the statute was unconstitutional in all its applica-tions. (I say that is an eminently reasonable requirement,

not only because we should not be holding a statute voidin all its applications unless it is unconstitutional in all its
applications, but also because unless it is unconstitutional inall its applications we do not even know, without conducting
an as-applied analysis, whether it is void with regard to thevery litigant

Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U. S. 489, 495 (1982) ("A
plaintiff who engages in some conduct that is clearly proscribed cannot
complain of the vagueness of the law as applied to the conduct of others.
A court should therefore examine the complainant's conduct before analyzing other hypothetical applications of the law"); Parker v. Levy, 417 U. S.
733, 756 (1974) ("One to whose conduct a statute clearly applies may not
successfully challenge it for vagueness").

The plurality asserts that in United States v. Salerno, 481 U. S. 739
(1987), which I discuss in text immediately following this footnote, the
Court "entertained" a facial challenge even though "the defendants . . .
did not claim that the statute was unconstitutional as applied to them."
Ante, at 55, n. 22. That is not so. The Court made it absolutely clear
in Salerno that a facial challenge requires the assertion that "no set of
circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid," 481 U. S., at
745 (emphasis added). The footnoted statement upon which the plurality
relies ("Nor have respondents claimed that the Act is unconstitutional because of the way it was applied to the particular facts of their case," id.,
at 745, n. 3) was obviously meant to convey the fact that the defendants
were not making, in addition to their facial challenge, an alternative
as-applied challenge--i. e., asserting that even if the statute was not unconstitutional in all its applications it was at least unconstitutional in its
particular application to them.

stances exists under which the Act would be valid.The fact that [a legislative Act] might operate unconstitutionally under some conceivable set of circumstancesis insufficient to render it wholly invalid, since we have
not recognized an `overbreadth' doctrine outside thelimited context of the First Amendment." (Emphasis
added.) 2
This proposition did not originate with Salerno, but hadbeen expressed in a line of prior opinions. See,

e. g., Mem-bers of City Council of Los Angeles v. Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U. S. 789, 796 (1984) (opinion for the Court by Stevens, J.) (statute not implicating First Amendment rights isinvalid on its face if "it is unconstitutional in every conceivable application"); Schall v. Martin, 467 U. S. 253, 269, n. 18(1984); Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc.,
455 U. S. 489, 494-495, 497 (1982); United States v. NationalDairy Products Corp., 372 U. S. 29, 31-32 (1963); Raines,
362 U. S., at 21. And the proposition has been reaffirmedin many cases and opinions since. See,

e. g., Anderson v.Edwards, 514 U. S. 143, 155-156, n. 6 (1995) (unanimous

Court); Babbitt v. Sweet Home Chapter, Communities forGreat Ore., 515 U. S. 687, 699 (1995) (opinion for the Court

by Stevens, J.) (facial challenge asserts that a challengedstatute or regulation is invalid "in every circumstance");
Reno v. Flores, 507 U. S. 292, 301 (1993); Rust v. Sullivan,

2 Salerno, a criminal case, repudiated the Court's statement in Kolender
v. Lawson, 461 U. S. 352, 359, n. 8 (1983), to the effect that a facial challenge to a criminal statute could succeed "even when [the statute] could
conceivably have had some valid application." Kolender seems to have
confused the standard for First Amendment overbreadth challenges with
the standard governing facial challenges on all other grounds. See ibid.
(citing the Court's articulation of the standard for First Amendment overbreadth challenges from Hoffman Estates, supra, at 494). As Salerno
noted, supra, at 745, the overbreadth doctrine is a specialized exception
to the general rule for facial challenges, justified in light of the risk that
an overbroad statute will chill free expression. See, e. g., Broadrick v.
Oklahoma, 413 U. S. 601, 612 (1973).

3 The plurality asserts that the Salerno standard for facial challenge
"has never been the decisive factor in any decision of this Court." Ante,
at 55, n. 22. It means by that only this: in rejecting a facial challenge,
the Court has never contented itself with identifying only one situation
in which the challenged statute would be constitutional, but has mentioned
several. But that is not at all remarkable, and casts no doubt upon the
validity of the principle that Salerno and these many other cases enunciated. It is difficult to conceive of a statute that would be constitutional
in only a single application--and hard to resist mentioning more than one.

The plurality contends that it does not matter whether the Salerno
standard is federal law, since facial challenge is a species of third-party
standing, and federal limitations upon third-party standing do not apply
in an appeal from a state decision which takes a broader view, as the
Illinois Supreme Court's opinion did here. Ante, at 55-56, n. 22. This is

quite wrong. Disagreement over the Salerno rule is not a disagreement
over the "standing" question whether the person challenging the statute
can raise the rights of third parties: under both Salerno and the plurality's
rule he can. The disagreement relates to how many third-party rights
he must prove to be infringed by the statute before he can win: Salerno
says "all" (in addition to his own rights), the plurality says "many." That
is not a question of standing but of substantive law. The notion that, if
Salerno is the federal rule (a federal statute is not totally invalid unless
it is invalid in all its applications), it can be altered by a state court (a
federal statute is totally invalid if it is invalid in many of its applications),
and that that alteration must be accepted by the Supreme Court of the
United States is, to put it as gently as possible, remarkable.

I am aware, of course, that in some recent facial-challengecases the Court has, without any attempt at explanation, created entirely irrational exceptions to the "unconstitutional inevery conceivable application" rule, when the statutes at
issue concerned hot-button social issues on which "informedopinion" was zealously united. See

Romer v. Evans, 517U. S. 620, 643 (1996) (
Scalia, J., dissenting) (homosexualrights);
Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey,505 U. S. 833, 895 (1992) (abortion rights). But the present

case does not even lend itself to such a "political correctness"exception--which, though illogical, is at least predictable.
It is not a` la mode to favor gang members and associatedloiterers over the beleaguered law-abiding residents of the
inner city.When our normal criteria for facial challenges are applied,
it is clear that the Justices in the majority have transposedthe burden of proof. Instead of requiring respondents, who
are challenging the ordinance, to show that it is invalid in allits applications, they have required petitioner to show that
it is valid in all its applications. Both the plurality opinionand the concurrences display a lively imagination, creating
hypothetical situations in which the law's application would(in their view) be ambiguous. But that creative role has
been usurped from petitioner, who can defeat respondents'facial challenge by conjuring up a single valid application
of the law. My contribution would go something like this: 5Tony, a member of the Jets criminal street gang, is standing

alongside and chatting with fellow gang members while stak-ing out their turf at Promontory Point on the South Side of

Chicago; the group is flashing gang signs and displaying theirdistinctive tattoos to passersby. Officer Krupke, applying
the ordinance at issue here, orders the group to disperse.
After some speculative discussion (probably irrelevant here)over whether the Jets are depraved because they are deprived, Tony and the other gang members break off furtherconversation with the statement--not entirely coherent, but
evidently intended to be rude--"Gee, Officer Krupke, krupyou." A tense standoff ensues until Officer Krupke arrests
the group for failing to obey his dispersal order. Even assuming (as the Justices in the majority do, but I do not) that
a law requiring obedience to a dispersal order is impermissibly vague unless it is clear to the objects of the order, before
its issuance, that their conduct justifies it, I find it hard to
believe that the Jets would not have known they had it coming. That should settle the matter of respondents' facial
challenge to the ordinance's vagueness.

Of course respondents would still be able to claim that the
ordinance was vague as applied to them. But the ultimate
demonstration of the inappropriateness of the Court's holding of facial invalidity is the fact that it is doubtful whether
some of these respondents could even sustain an as-applied
challenge on the basis of the majority's own criteria. For
instance, respondent Jose Renteria--who admitted that he
was a member of the Satan Disciples gang--was observed
by the arresting officer loitering on a street corner with
other gang members. The officer issued a dispersal order,
but when she returned to the same corner 15 to 20 minutes
later, Renteria was still there with his friends, whereupon
he was arrested. In another example, respondent Daniel
Washington and several others--who admitted they were
members of the Vice Lords gang--were observed by the arresting officer loitering in the street, yelling at passing vehicles, stopping traffic, and preventing pedestrians from using

the sidewalks. The arresting officer issued a dispersalorder, issued another dispersal order later when the group

did not move, and finally arrested the group when they werefound loitering in the same place still later. Finally, respondent Gregorio Gutierrez--who had previously admittedto the arresting officer his membership in the Latin Kings
gang--was observed loitering with two other men. The of-ficer issued a dispersal order, drove around the block, and
arrested the men after finding them in the same place uponhis return. See Brief for Petitioner 7, n. 5; Brief for United
States as Amicus Curiae 16, n. 11. Even on the majority'sassumption that to avoid vagueness it must be clear to the
object of the dispersal order ex ante that his conduct is cov-ered by the ordinance, it seems most improbable that any of
these as-applied challenges would be sustained. Much lessis it possible to say that the ordinance is invalid in all its
applications. II

The plurality's explanation for its departure from the usualrule governing facial challenges is seemingly contained in
the following statement: "[This] is a criminal law that con-tains no mens rea requirement . . . and infringes on constitutionally protected rights . . . . When vagueness permeatesthe text of

such a law, it is subject to facial attack." Ante,at 55 (emphasis added). The proposition is set forth with

such assurance that one might suppose that it repeats somewell-accepted formula in our jurisprudence: (Criminal law
without mens rea requirement) ` (infringement of consti-tutionally protected right)

` (vagueness) 4 (entitlement tofacial invalidation). There is no such formula; the plurality

has made it up for this case, as the absence of any citationdemonstrates.

But no matter. None of the three factors that the plural-ity relies upon exists anyway. I turn first to the support for
the proposition that there is a constitutionally protectedright to loiter--or, as the plurality more favorably describes

527US1 Unit: $U70 [05-09-01 12:56:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN
84 CHICAGO v. MORALES

Scalia, J., dissenting
it, for a person to "remain in a public place of his choice."
Ante, at 54. The plurality thinks much of this Fundamental
Freedom to Loiter, which it contrasts with such lesser, con-stitutionally

unprotected, activities as doing (ugh!) business:
"This is not an ordinance that simply regulates business behavior and contains a scienter requirement. . . . It is a crimi-nal law that contains no

mens rea requirement . . . and infringes on constitutionally protected rights." Ante, at 55(internal quotation marks omitted). (Poor Alexander Hamilton, who has seen his "commercial republic" devolve, in theeyes of the plurality, at least, into an "indolent republic," see
The Federalist No. 6, p. 56; No. 11, pp. 84-91 (C. Rossiter
ed. 1961).)

Of course every activity, even scratching one's head, can
be called a "constitutional right" if one means by that term
nothing more than the fact that the activity is covered (as
all are) by the Equal Protection Clause, so that those who
engage in it cannot be singled out without "rational basis."
See FCC v. Beach Communications, Inc., 508 U. S. 307, 313
(1993). But using the term in that sense utterly impoverishes our constitutional discourse. We would then need
a new term for those activities--such as political speech
or religious worship--that cannot be forbidden even with
rational basis.

The plurality tosses around the term "constitutional right"
in this renegade sense, because there is not the slightest evidence for the existence of a genuine constitutional right to
loiter. Justice Thomas recounts the vast historical tradition of criminalizing the activity. Post, at 102-106 (dissenting opinion). It is simply not maintainable that the right to
loiter would have been regarded as an essential attribute of
liberty at the time of the framing or at the time of adoption
of the Fourteenth Amendment. For the plurality, however,
the historical practices of our people are nothing more than
a speed bump on the road to the "right" result. Its opinion
blithely proclaims: "Neither this history nor the scholarly

compendia in Justice Thomas' dissent, [ibid.,] persuades usthat the right to engage in loitering that is entirely harmless

in both purpose and effect is not a part of the liberty pro-tected by the Due Process Clause."

Ante, at 54, n. 20. The
entire practice of using the Due Process Clause to add judicially favored rights to the limitations upon democracy setforth in the Bill of Rights (usually under the rubric of socalled "substantive due process") is in my view judicial usur-pation. But we have, recently at least, sought to limit the
damage by tethering the courts' "right-making" power to anobjective criterion. In

Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U. S.
702, 720-721 (1997), we explained our "established method"of substantive due process analysis: carefully and narrowly

describing the asserted right, and then examining whether
that right is manifested in "[o]ur Nation's history, legal tradi-tions, and practices." See also

Collins v. Harker Heights,
503 U. S. 115, 125-126 (1992); Michael H. v. Gerald D., 491
U. S. 110, 122-123 (1989); Moore v. East Cleveland, 431 U. S.
494, 502-503 (1977). The plurality opinion not only ignores
this necessary limitation, but it leaps far beyond any
substantive-due-process atrocity we have ever committed, by
actually placing the burden of proof upon the defendant to
establish that loitering is not a "fundamental liberty." It
never does marshal any support for the proposition that loitering is a constitutional right, contenting itself with a
(transparently inadequate) explanation of why the historical
record of laws banning loitering does not positively contradict that proposition,6 and the (transparently erroneous) assertion that the city of Chicago appears to have conceded the

6 The plurality's explanation for ignoring these laws is that many of them
carried severe penalties and, during the Reconstruction era, they had
"harsh consequences on African-American women and children." Ante,
at 54, n. 20. Those severe penalties and those harsh consequences are
certainly regrettable, but they in no way lessen (indeed, the harshness of
penalty tends to increase) the capacity of these laws to prove that loitering
was never regarded as a fundamental liberty.

point.7 It is enough for the Members of the plurality that"history . . . [fails to] persuad[e] us that the right to engage

in loitering that is entirely harmless in both purpose andeffect is not a part of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause," ante, at 54, n. 20 (emphasis added); they appar-ently think it quite unnecessary for anything to persuade
them that it is.8It would be unfair, however, to criticize the plurality's

failed attempt to establish that loitering is a constitutionally

7 Ante, at 53, n. 19. The plurality bases its assertion of apparent concession upon a footnote in Part I of petitioner's brief which reads: "Of course,
laws regulating social gatherings affect a liberty interest, and thus are
subject to review under the rubric of substantive due process . . . . We
address that doctrine in Part II below." Brief for Petitioner 21-22, n. 13.
If a careless reader were inclined to confuse the term "social gatherings"
in this passage with "loitering," his confusion would be eliminated by pursuing the reference to Part II of the brief, which says, in its introductory
paragraph: "[A]s we explain below, substantive due process does not support the court's novel holding that the Constitution secures the right to
stand still on the public way even when one is not engaged in speech,
assembly, or other conduct that enjoys affirmative constitutional protection." Id., at 39.

8 The plurality says, ante, at 64, n. 35, that since it decides the case on

the basis of procedural due process rather than substantive due process,
I am mistaken in analyzing its opinion "under the framework for substantive due process set out in Washington v. Glucksberg." Ibid. But I am

not analyzing it under that framework. I am simply assuming that when
the plurality says (as an essential part of its reasoning) that "the right to
loiter for innocent purposes is . . . a part of the liberty protected by the
Due Process Clause" it does not believe that the same word ("liberty")
means one thing for purposes of substantive due process and something
else for purposes of procedural due process. There is no authority for
that startling proposition. See Board of Regents of State Colleges v.
Roth, 408 U. S. 564, 572-575 (1972) (rejecting procedural-due-process claim
for lack of "liberty" interest, and citing substantive-due-process cases).

The plurality's opinion seeks to have it both ways, invoking the Fourteenth Amendment's august protection of "liberty" in defining the standard of certainty that it sets, but then, in identifying the conduct protected
by that high standard, ignoring our extensive case law defining "liberty,"
and substituting, instead, all "harmless and innocent" conduct, ante, at 58.

protected right while saying nothing of the concurrences.The plurality at least makes an attempt. The concurrences,

on the other hand, make no pretense at attaching their broad"vagueness invalidates" rule to a liberty interest. As far as
appears from Justice O'Connor's and Justice Breyer's
opinions, no police officer may issue any order, affecting anyinsignificant sort of citizen conduct (except, perhaps, an order

addressed to the unprotected class of "gang members") un-less the standards for the issuance of that order are precise.
No modern urban society--and probably none since Londongot big enough to have sewers--could function under such a
rule. There are innumerable reasons why it may be important for a constable to tell a pedestrian to "move on"--and
even if it were possible to list in an ordinance all of the reasons that are known, many are simply unpredictable. Hence
the (entirely reasonable) Rule of the city of New York which
reads: "No person shall fail, neglect or refuse to comply with
the lawful direction or command of any Police Officer, Urban
Park Ranger, Parks Enforcement Patrol Officer or other
[Parks and Recreation] Department employee, indicated
verbally, by gesture or otherwise." 56 RCNY $ 1-03(c)(1)
(1996). It is one thing to uphold an "as-applied" challenge
when a pedestrian disobeys such an order that is unreasonable--or even when a pedestrian asserting some true "liberty" interest (holding a political rally, for instance) disobeys
such an order that is reasonable but unexplained. But to
say that such a general ordinance permitting "lawful orders"
is void in all its applications demands more than a safe and
orderly society can reasonably deliver.

Justice Kennedy apparently recognizes this, since he acknowledges that "some police commands will subject a citizen to prosecution for disobeying whether or not the citizen
knows why the order is given," including, for example, an
order "tell[ing] a pedestrian not to enter a building" when
the reason is "to avoid impeding a rescue team." Ante, at
69 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment).

Scalia, J., dissenting
But his only explanation of why the present interferencewith the "right to loiter" does not fall within that permitted

scope of action is as follows: "The predicate of an order todisperse is not, in my view, sufficient to eliminate doubts
regarding the adequacy of notice under this ordinance."
Ibid. I have not the slightest idea what this means. ButI do understand that the followup explanatory sentence,

showing how this principle invalidates the present ordinance,applies equally to the rescue-team example that

Justice
Kennedy thinks is constitutional--as is demonstrated bysubstituting for references to the facts of the present case

(shown in italics) references to his rescue-team hypothetical(shown in brackets): "A citizen, while engaging in a wide
array of innocent conduct, is not likely to know when he maybe subject to a

dispersal order [order not to enter a building]based on the officer's own knowledge of the identity or affiliations of other persons with whom the citizen is congregat-ing [what is going on in the building]; nor may the citizen be
able to assess what an officer might conceive to be the citizen's lack of an apparent purpose [the impeding of a rescueteam]." Ante, at 69-70.

III
I turn next to that element of the plurality's facial-challenge formula which consists of the proposition that this

criminal ordinance contains no mens rea requirement. Thefirst step in analyzing this proposition is to determine what
the actus reus, to which that mens rea is supposed to beattached, consists of. The majority believes that loitering
forms part of (indeed, the essence of) the offense, and mustbe proved if conviction is to be obtained. See

ante, at 47,50-51, 53-55, 57-59, 60-61, 62-63 (plurality and majority

opinions); ante, at 65, 66, 68 (O'Connor, J., concurring in partand concurring in judgment);

ante, at 69-70 (Kennedy, J.,concurring in part and concurring in judgment); ante, at

72-73 (Breyer, J., concurring in part and concurring injudgment). That is not what the ordinance provides. The

Scalia, J., dissenting
only part of the ordinance that refers to loitering is the por-tion that addresses, not the punishable conduct of the defendant, but what the police officer must observe before he canissue an order to disperse; and what he must observe is carefully defined in terms of what the defendant appears to bedoing, not in terms of what the defendant is

actually doing.The ordinance does not require that the defendant have been

loitering (i. e., have been remaining in one place with no pur-pose), but rather that the police officer have observed him
remaining in one place without any apparent purpose.Someone who in fact has a genuine purpose for remaining
where he is (waiting for a friend, for example, or waiting tohold up a bank)

can be ordered to move on (assuming theother conditions of the ordinance are met), so long as his

remaining has no apparent purpose. It is likely, to be sure,that the ordinance will come down most heavily upon those
who are actually loitering (those who really have no purposein remaining where they are); but that activity is not a condition for issuance of the dispersal order.The

only act of a defendant that is made punishable by theordinance--or, indeed, that is even mentioned by the ordinance--is his failure to "promptly obey" an order to disperse.The question, then, is whether that actus reus must be accompanied by any wrongful intent--and of course it must.As the Court itself describes the requirement, "a person
must disobey the officer's order." Ante, at 47 (emphasisadded). No one thinks a defendant could be successfully

prosecuted under the ordinance if he did not hear the orderto disperse, or if he suffered a paralysis that rendered his
compliance impossible. The willful failure to obey a policeorder is wrongful intent enough.

IV
Finally, I address the last of the three factors in the plural-ity's facial-challenge formula: the proposition that the ordinance is vague. It is not. Even under the ersatz over527US1 Unit: $U70 [05-09-01 12:56:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN
90 CHICAGO v. MORALES

Scalia, J., dissenting
breadth standard applied in Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U. S.352, 358, n. 8 (1983), which allows facial challenges if a law

reaches "a substantial amount of constitutionally protectedconduct," respondents' claim fails because the ordinance
would not be vague in most or even a substantial number ofapplications. A law is unconstitutionally vague if its lack
of definitive standards either (1) fails to apprise persons ofordinary intelligence of the prohibited conduct, or (2) encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. See, e. g.,
Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U. S. 104, 108 (1972).The plurality relies primarily upon the first of these aspects. Since, it reasons, "the loitering is the conduct thatthe ordinance is designed to prohibit," and "an officer may
issue an order only after prohibited conduct has already oc-curred,"

ante, at 58, 59, the order to disperse cannot itselfserve "to apprise persons of ordinary intelligence of the prohibited conduct." What counts for purposes of vaguenessanalysis, however, is not what the ordinance is "designed to
prohibit," but what it actually subjects to criminal penalty.As discussed earlier, that consists of nothing but the refusal
to obey a dispersal order, as to which there is no doubt ofadequate notice of the prohibited conduct. The plurality's
suggestion that even the dispersal order itself is unconstitu-tionally vague, because it does not specify

how far to dis-perse(!), see ante, at 59, scarcely requires a response.

it were true, it would render unconstitutional for vaguenessmany of the Presidential proclamations issued under that

provision of the United States Code which requires the Pres9 I call it a "suggestion" because the plurality says only that the terms
of the dispersal order "compound the inadequacy of the notice," and acknowledges that they "might not render the ordinance unconstitutionally
vague if the definition of the forbidden conduct were clear." Ante, at 59,
59-60. This notion that a prescription ("Disperse!") which is itself not
unconstitutionally vague can somehow contribute to the unconstitutional
vagueness of the entire scheme is full of mystery--suspending, as it does,
the metaphysical principle that nothing can confer what it does not possess
(nemo dat qui non habet).

See also Boos v. Barry, 485 U. S. 312, 331 (1988) (rejecting
overbreadth/vagueness challenge to a law allowing police officers to order congregations near foreign embassies to disperse); Cox v. Louisiana, 379 U. S. 536, 551 (1965) (rejecting
vagueness challenge to the dispersal-order prong of a
breach-of-the-peace statute and describing that prong as
"narrow and specific").

For its determination of unconstitutional vagueness, the
Court relies secondarily--and Justice O'Connor's and Justice Breyer's concurrences exclusively--upon the second
aspect of that doctrine, which requires sufficient specificity
to prevent arbitrary and discriminatory law enforcement.
See ante, at 60 (majority opinion); ante, at 65-66 (O'Connor,
J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); ante, at
72 (Breyer, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). In discussing whether Chicago's ordinance meets
that requirement, the Justices in the majority hide behind
an artificial construct of judicial restraint. They point to the
Supreme Court of Illinois' statement that the "apparent
purpose" standard "provides absolute discretion to police
officers to decide what activities constitute loitering," 177
Ill. 2d 440, 457, 687 N. E. 2d 53, 63 (1997), and protest that it
would be wrong to construe the language of the ordinance
more narrowly than did the State's highest court. Ante, at

Scalia, J., dissenting
61, 63 (majority opinion); ante, at 68 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). The "absolute
discretion" statement, however, is nothing more than the Illinois Supreme Court's characterization of what the language
achieved--after that court refused (as I do) to read in any
limitations that the words do not fairly contain. It is not a
construction of the language (to which we are bound) but a
legal conclusion (to which we most assuredly are not bound).

The criteria for issuance of a dispersal order under the
Chicago ordinance could hardly be clearer. First, the law
requires police officers to "reasonably believ[e]" that one of
the group to which the order is issued is a "criminal street
gang member." This resembles a probable-cause standard,
and the Chicago Police Department's General Order 92-4
(1992)--promulgated to govern enforcement of the ordinance--makes the probable-cause requirement explicit.10
Under the Order, officers must have probable cause to believe that an individual is a member of a criminal street gang,
to be substantiated by the officer's "experience and knowledge of the alleged offenders" and by "specific, documented
and reliable information" such as reliable witness testimony
or an individual's admission of gang membership or display
of distinctive colors, tattoos, signs, or other markings worn
by members of particular criminal street gangs. App. to
Pet. for Cert. 67a-69a, 71a-72a.

Second, the ordinance requires that the group be "remain[ing] in any one place with no apparent purpose." Justice
O'Connor's assertion that this applies to "any person stand10 "Administrative interpretation and implementation of a regulation
are . . . highly relevant to our [vagueness] analysis, for `[i]n evaluating a
facial challenge to a state law, a federal court must . . . consider any limiting construction that a state court or enforcement agency has proffered.' "
Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U. S. 781, 795-796 (1989) (emphasis
added) (quoting Hoffman Estates, 455 U. S., at 494, n. 5). See also id., at
504 (administrative regulations "will often suffice to clarify a standard
with an otherwise uncertain scope").

ing in a public place," ante, at 66, is a distortion. The ordi-nance does not apply to "standing," but to "remain[ing]"--

a term which in this context obviously means "[to] endureor persist," see American Heritage Dictionary 1525 (1992).
There may be some ambiguity at the margin, but "remain-[ing] in one place" requires more than a temporary stop, and
is clear in most of its applications, including all of those rep-resented by the facts surrounding respondents' arrests described supra, at 82-83.As for the phrase "with no apparent purpose":

JusticeO'C
onnor again distorts this adjectival phrase, by separat-ing it from the word that it modifies. "[A]ny person standing on the street," her concurrence says, "has a general `pur-pose'--even if it is simply to stand," and thus "the ordinance
permits police officers to choose which purposes are permissible." Ante, at 66. But Chicago police officers enforcing
the ordinance are not looking for people with no apparentpurpose (who are regrettably in oversupply); they are looking for people who "remain in any one place with no apparent purpose"--that is, who remain there without any ap-parent reason

for remaining there. That is not difficult to
perceive.11The Court's attempt to demonstrate the vagueness of the

ordinance produces the following peculiar statement: "The
`no apparent purpose' standard for making [the decision to

11 Justice Breyer asserts that "one always has some apparent purpose," so that the policeman must "interpret the words `no apparent purpose' as meaning `no apparent purpose except for . . . .' " Ante, at 70. It
is simply not true that "one always has some apparent purpose"--and
especially not true that one always has some apparent purpose in remaining at rest, for the simple reason that one often (indeed, perhaps usually)
has no actual purpose in remaining at rest. Remaining at rest will be a
person's normal state, unless he has a purpose which causes him to move.
That is why one frequently reads of a person's "wandering aimlessly"
(which is worthy of note) but not of a person's "sitting aimlessly" (which
is not remarkable at all). And that is why a synonym for "purpose" is
"motive": that which causes one to move.

Scalia, J., dissenting
issue an order to disperse] is inherently subjective becauseits application depends on whether some purpose is `apparent' to the officer on the scene." Ante, at 62. In theCourt's view, a person's lack of any purpose in staying in
one location is presumably an objective factor, and what theordinance requires as a condition of an order to disperse--
the absence of any apparent purpose--is a subjective factor.This side of the looking glass, just the opposite is true.

Elsewhere, of course, the Court acknowledges the clear,objective commands of the ordinance, and indeed relies upon
them to paint it as unfair:

"In any public place in the city of Chicago, persons whostand or sit in the company of a gang member may be

ordered to disperse unless their purpose is apparent.The mandatory language in the enactment directs the
police to issue an order without first making any inquiryabout their possible purposes. It matters not whether
the reason that a gang member and his father, for exam-ple, might loiter near Wrigley Field is to rob an unsuspecting fan or just to get a glimpse of Sammy Sosa leav-ing the ballpark; in either event, if their purpose is not
apparent to a nearby police officer, she may--indeed, she`shall'--order them to disperse." Ante, at 60.

Quite so. And the fact that this clear instruction to the of-ficers "reach[es] a substantial amount of innocent conduct,"
ibid., would be invalidating if that conduct were constitution-ally protected against abridgment, such as speech or the
practice of religion. Remaining in one place is not so pro-tected, and so (as already discussed) it is up to the citizens
of Chicago--not us--to decide whether the tradeoff isworth it.

12

12 The Court speculates that a police officer may exercise his discretion
to enforce the ordinance and direct dispersal when (in the Court's view)
the ordinance is inapplicable--viz., where there is an apparent purpose,
but it is an unlawful one. See ante, at 62. No one in his right mind

Justice Breyer's concurrence tries to perform the im-possible feat of affirming our unquestioned rule that a criminal statute that is so vague as to give constitutionally inade-quate notice to some violators may nonetheless be enforced
against those whose conduct is clearly covered, see ante, at71-72, citing

Parker v. Levy, 417 U. S. 733 (1974), while atthe same time asserting that a statute which "delegates too

much discretion to a police officer" is invalid in all its appli-cations, even where the officer uses his discretion "wisely,"
ante, at 71. But the vagueness that causes notice to be inad-equate is the very same vagueness that causes "too much
discretion" to be lodged in the enforcing officer. Put an-other way: A law that gives the policeman clear guidance in
all cases gives the public clear guidance in all cases as well.Thus, what

Justice Breyer gives with one hand, he takesaway with the other. In his view, vague statutes that nonetheless give adequate notice to some violators are not un-enforceable against those violators because of inadequate
notice, but are unenforceable against them "because thepoliceman enjoys too much discretion in

every case," ibid.This is simply contrary to our case law, including Parker v.

Levy, supra.13
would read the phrase "without any apparent purpose" to mean anything
other than "without any apparent lawful purpose." The implication that
acts referred to approvingly in statutory language are "lawful" acts is
routine. The Court asserts that the Illinois Supreme Court has forced it
into this interpretive inanity because, since it "has not placed any limiting
construction on the language in the ordinance, we must assume that the
ordinance means what it says . . . ." Ante, at 63. But the Illinois Supreme Court did not mention this particular interpretive issue, which has
nothing to do with giving the ordinance a "limiting" interpretation, and
everything to do with giving it its ordinary legal meaning.

13 The opinion that Justice Breyer relies on, Coates v. Cincinnati, 402

U. S. 611 (1971), discussed ante, at 72-73, did not say that the ordinance
there at issue gave adequate notice but did not provide adequate standards for the police. It invalidated that ordinance on both inadequatenotice and inadequate-enforcement-standard grounds, because First
Amendment rights were implicated. It is common ground, however, that

The plurality points out that Chicago already has several
laws that reach the intimidating and unlawful gang-related
conduct the ordinance was directed at. See ante, at 52,
n. 17. The problem, of course, well recognized by Chicago's
city council, is that the gang members cease their intimidating and unlawful behavior under the watchful eye of police
officers, but return to it as soon as the police drive away.
The only solution, the council concluded, was to clear the
streets of congregations of gangs, their drug customers, and
their associates.

Justice O'Connor's concurrence proffers the same empty
solace of existing laws useless for the purpose at hand, see
ante, at 67, 67-68, but seeks to be helpful by suggesting some
measures similar to this ordinance that would be constitutional. It says that Chicago could, for example, enact a law
that "directly prohibit[s] the presence of a large collection of
obviously brazen, insistent, and lawless gang members and
hangers-on on the public ways, that intimidates residents."
Ante, at 67 (internal quotation marks omitted). (If the majority considers the present ordinance too vague, it would be
fun to see what it makes of "a large collection of obviously
brazen, insistent, and lawless gang members.") This prescription of the concurrence is largely a quotation from the
plurality--which itself answers the concurrence's suggestion
that such a law would be helpful by pointing out that the city
already "has several laws that serve this purpose." Ante,
at 52, n. 17 (plurality opinion) (citing extant laws against "intimidation," "streetgang criminal drug conspiracy," and
"mob action"). The problem, again, is that the intimidation
and lawlessness do not occur when the police are in sight.

the present case does not implicate the First Amendment, see ante, at
52-53 (plurality opinion); ante, at 72 (Breyer, J., concurring in part and
concurring in judgment).

Justice O'Connor's concurrence also proffers anothercure: "If the ordinance applied only to persons reasonably

believed to be gang members, this requirement might havecured the ordinance's vagueness because it would have directed the manner in which the order was issued by specify-ing to whom the order could be issued."

Ante, at 66 (theCourt agrees that this might be a cure, see ante, at 62). But

the ordinance already specifies to whom the order can beissued: persons remaining in one place with no apparent purpose in the company of a gang member. And if "remain[ing]in one place with no apparent purpose" is so vague as to give
the police unbridled discretion in controlling the conduct ofnongang members, it surpasses understanding how it ceases
to be so vague when applied to gang members alone.Surely gang members cannot be decreed to be outlaws, subject to the merest whim of the police as the rest of us are not.

* * *
The fact is that the present ordinance is entirely clear inits application, cannot be violated except with full knowledge

and intent, and vests no more discretion in the police thaninnumerable other measures authorizing police orders to preserve the public peace and safety. As suggested by theirtortured analyses, and by their suggested solutions that bear
no relation to the identified constitutional problem, the ma-jority's real quarrel with the Chicago ordinance is simply
that it permits (or indeed requires) too much harmless con-duct by innocent citizens to be proscribed. As

JusticeO'C
onnor's concurrence says with disapprobation, "the ordi-nance applies to hundreds of thousands of persons who are

not gang members, standing on any sidewalk or in any park,coffee shop, bar, or other location open to the public." Ante,
at 66 (internal quotation marks omitted).But in our democratic system, how much harmless conduct
to proscribe is not a judgment to be made by the courts. Solong as constitutionally guaranteed rights are not affected,

and so long as the proscription has a rational basis, all sortsof perfectly harmless activity by millions of perfectly innocent people can be forbidden--riding a motorcycle without asafety helmet, for example, starting a campfire in a national
forest, or selling a safe and effective drug not yet approvedby the Food and Drug Administration. All of these acts are
entirely innocent and harmless in themselves, but because ofthe

risk of harm that they entail, the freedom to engage inthem has been abridged. The citizens of Chicago have decided that depriving themselves of the freedom to "hang out"with a gang member is necessary to eliminate pervasive
gang crime and intimidation--and that the elimination of theone is worth the deprivation of the other. This Court has
no business second-guessing either the degree of necessityor the fairness of the trade.

I dissent from the judgment of the Court.
Justice Thomas, with whom The Chief Justice and
Justice Scalia join, dissenting.

The duly elected members of the Chicago City Councilenacted the ordinance at issue as part of a larger effort to

prevent gangs from establishing dominion over the publicstreets. By invalidating Chicago's ordinance, I fear that the
Court has unnecessarily sentenced law-abiding citizens tolives of terror and misery. The ordinance is not vague.

and lifestyle changes among law-abiding residents." U. S.Dept. of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, Bureau of Justice
Assistance, Monograph: Urban Street Gang Enforcement 3(1997). Gangs fill the daily lives of many of our poorest and
most vulnerable citizens with a terror that the Court doesnot give sufficient consideration, often relegating them to the
status of prisoners in their own homes. See U. S. Dept. ofJustice, Attorney General's Report to the President, Coordinated Approach to the Challenge of Gang Violence: A Prog-ress Report 1 (Apr. 1996) ("From the small business owner
who is literally crippled because he refuses to pay `protec-tion' money to the neighborhood gang, to the families who
are hostages within their homes, living in neighborhoodsruled by predatory drug trafficking gangs, the harmful impact of gang violence . . . is both physically and psychologi-cally debilitating").

The city of Chicago has suffered the devastation wroughtby this national tragedy. Last year, in an effort to curb
plummeting attendance, the Chicago Public Schools hireddozens of adults to escort children to school. The youngsters had become too terrified of gang violence to leave theirhomes alone. Martinez, Parents Paid to Walk Line Between
Gangs and School, Chicago Tribune, Jan. 21, 1998, p. 1. Thechildren's fears were not unfounded. In 1996, the Chicago
Police Department estimated that there were 132 criminalstreet gangs in the city. Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority, Research Bulletin: Street Gangs and Crime4 (Sept. 1996). Between 1987 and 1994, these gangs were
involved in 63,141 criminal incidents, including 21,689 non-lethal violent crimes and 894 homicides. Id., at 4-5.

held extensive hearings on the problems of gang loitering.Concerned citizens appeared to testify poignantly as to how
gangs disrupt their daily lives. Ordinary citizens like Ms.D'Ivory Gordon explained that she struggled just to walk
to work:

"When I walk out my door, these guys are out there . . . .. . . . .

"They watch you. . . . They know where you live.
They know what time you leave, what time you comehome. I am afraid of them. I have even come to the

point now that I carry a meat cleaver to work with

Chicago, Committee on Police and Fire 66-67 (May 15,1992) (hereinafter Transcript).

Eighty-eight-year-old Susan Mary Jackson echoed her senti-ments, testifying: "We used to have a nice neighborhood.
We don't have it anymore . . . . I am scared to go out in thedaytime. . . . [Y]ou can't pass because they are standing. I
am afraid to go to the store. I don't go to the store becauseI am afraid. At my age if they look at me real hard, I be
ready to holler." Id., at 93-95. Another long-time resi-dent testified:

"I have never had the terror that I feel everyday whenI walk down the streets of Chicago. . . .

. . . . .
"I have had my windows broken out. I have hadguns pulled on me. I have been threatened. I get intimidated on a daily basis, and it's come to the pointwhere I say, well, do I go out today. Do I put my ax in
my briefcase. Do I walk around dressed like a bum soI am not looking rich or got any money or anything like
that." Id., at 124-125.
Following these hearings, the council found that "criminalstreet gangs establish control over identifiable areas . . . by

loitering in those areas and intimidating others from enter-ing those areas." App. to Pet. for Cert. 60a. It further
found that the mere presence of gang members "intimidate[s]many law abiding citizens" and "creates a justifiable fear for
the safety of persons and property in the area." Ibid. Itis the product of this democratic process--the council's attempt to address these social ills--that we are asked to passjudgment upon today.

II
As part of its ongoing effort to curb the deleterious effectsof criminal street gangs, the citizens of Chicago sensibly decided to return to basics. The ordinance does nothing morethan confirm the well-established principle that the police

Thomas, J., dissenting
have the duty and the power to maintain the public peace,and, when necessary, to disperse groups of individuals who

threaten it. The plurality, however, concludes that the city'scommonsense effort to combat gang loitering fails constitutional scrutiny for two separate reasons--because it in-fringes upon gang members' constitutional right to "loiter
for innocent purposes," ante, at 53, and because it is vagueon its face,

ante, at 55. A majority of the Court endorsesthe latter conclusion. I respectfully disagree.

A
We recently reconfirmed that "[o]ur Nation's history, legaltraditions, and practices . . . provide the crucial `guideposts

for responsible decisionmaking' . . . that direct and restrainour exposition of the Due Process Clause." Glucksberg,
521 U. S., at 721 (quoting Moore v. East Cleveland, 431 U. S.494, 503 (1977) (plurality opinion)). Only laws that infringe
"those fundamental rights and liberties which are, objec-tively, `deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition' " offend the Due Process Clause. Glucksberg, supra,at 720-721.

The plurality asserts that "the freedom to loiter for inno-cent purposes is part of the `liberty' protected by the Due
Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment." Ante, at53. Yet it acknowledges--as it must--that "antiloitering ordinances have long existed in this country." Ante, at 53,n. 20; see also 177 Ill. 2d 440, 450, 687 N. E. 2d 53, 60 (1997)
(case below) ("Loitering and vagrancy statutes have beenutilized throughout American history in an attempt to prevent crime by removing `undesirable persons' from publicbefore they have the opportunity to engage in criminal activity"). In derogation of the framework we articulated onlytwo Terms ago in

Glucksberg, the plurality asserts that thishistory fails to "persuad[e] us that the right to engage in

loitering that is entirely harmless . . . is not a part of theliberty protected by the Due Process Clause." Ante, at 54,

Thomas, J., dissenting
n. 20. Apparently, the plurality believes it sufficient to reston the proposition that antiloitering laws represent an anachronistic throwback to an earlier, less sophisticated, era. Forexample, it expresses concern that some antivagrancy laws
carried the penalty of slavery. Ibid. But this fact is irrele-vant to our analysis of whether there is a constitutional right
to loiter for innocent purposes. This case does not involvean antiloitering law carrying the penalty of slavery. The
law at issue in this case criminalizes the failure to obey apolice officer's order to disperse and imposes modest penalties, such as a fine of up to $500 and a prison sentence of upto six months.

The plurality's sweeping conclusion that this ordinance in-fringes upon a liberty interest protected by the Fourteenth
Amendment's Due Process Clause withers when exposed tothe relevant history: Laws prohibiting loitering and vagrancy have been a fixture of Anglo-American law at leastsince the time of the Norman Conquest. See generally
C. Ribton-Turner, A History of Vagrants and Vagrancy andBeggars and Begging (reprint 1972) (discussing history of
English vagrancy laws); see also Papachristou v. Jacksonville, 405 U. S. 156, 161-162 (1972) (recounting history of va-grancy laws). The American colonists enacted laws modeled

upon the English vagrancy laws, and at the time of thefounding, state and local governments customarily criminalized loitering and other forms of vagrancy.2 Vagrancy laws

Tellingly, the plurality cites only three cases in support of
the asserted right to "loiter for innocent purposes." See
ante, at 53-54. Of those, only one--decided more than 100
years after the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment--
actually addressed the validity of a vagrancy ordinance.
That case, Papachristou, supra, contains some dicta that can
be read to support the fundamental right that the plurality
asserts.5 However, the Court in Papachristou did not undertake the now-accepted analysis applied in substantive due
process cases--it did not look to tradition to define the rights
protected by the Due Process Clause. In any event, a careful reading of the opinion reveals that the Court never said
anything about a constitutional right. The Court's holding
was that the antiquarian language employed in the vagrancy
ordinance at issue was unconstitutionally vague. See id., at
162-163. Even assuming, then, that Papachristou was correctly decided as an original matter--a doubtful proposidon 1945); Kan. Gen. Stat. Ann. $ 21-2409 (1949); N. Y. Crim. Code $ 887

5 The other cases upon which the plurality relies concern the entirely

distinct right to interstate and international travel. See Williams v.
Fears, 179 U. S. 270, 274-275 (1900); Kent v. Dulles, 357 U. S. 116 (1958).
The plurality claims that dicta in those cases articulating a right of free
movement, see Williams, supra, at 274; Kent, supra, at 125, also supports
an individual's right to "remain in a public place of his choice." Ironically,
Williams rejected the argument that a tax on persons engaged in the
business of importing out-of-state labor impeded the freedom of transit,
so the precise holding in that case does not support, but undermines, the
plurality's view. Similarly, the precise holding in Kent did not bear on a
constitutional right to travel; instead, the Court held only that Congress
had not authorized the Secretary of State to deny certain passports. Furthermore, the plurality's approach distorts the principle articulated in
those cases, stretching it to a level of generality that permits the Court to
disregard the relevant historical evidence that should guide the analysis.

tion--it does not compel the conclusion that the Constitution
protects the right to loiter for innocent purposes. The plurality's contrary assertion calls to mind the warning that
"[t]he Judiciary, including this Court, is the most vulnerable and comes nearest to illegitimacy when it deals with
judge-made constitutional law having little or no cognizable roots in the language or even the design of the
Constitution. . . . [We] should be extremely reluctant to
breathe still further substantive content into the Due Process Clause so as to strike down legislation adopted by a State
or city to promote its welfare." Moore, 431 U. S., at 544
(White, J., dissenting). When "the Judiciary does so, it unavoidably pre-empts for itself another part of the governance
of the country without express constitutional authority."

The Court concludes that the ordinance is also unconstitutionally vague because it fails to provide adequate standards
to guide police discretion and because, in the plurality's view,
it does not give residents adequate notice of how to conform
their conduct to the confines of the law. I disagree on both
counts.

At the outset, it is important to note that the ordinance
does not criminalize loitering per se. Rather, it penalizes
loiterers' failure to obey a police officer's order to move
along. A majority of the Court believes that this scheme
vests too much discretion in police officers. Nothing could
be further from the truth. Far from according officers too
much discretion, the ordinance merely enables police officers
to fulfill one of their traditional functions. Police officers are
not, and have never been, simply enforcers of the criminal
law. They wear other hats--importantly, they have long
been vested with the responsibility for preserving the public
peace. See, e. g., O. Allen, Duties and Liabilities of Sheriffs

In order to perform their peacekeeping responsibilitiessatisfactorily, the police inevitably must exercise discretion.

Indeed, by empowering them to act as peace officers, the lawassumes that the police will exercise that discretion responsibly and with sound judgment. That is not to say that thelaw should not provide objective guidelines for the police,
but simply that it cannot rigidly constrain their every action.
By directing a police officer not to issue a dispersal order
unless he "observes a person whom he reasonably believes
to be a criminal street gang member loitering in any public place," App. to Pet. for Cert. 61a, Chicago's ordinance
strikes an appropriate balance between those two extremes.

about amorphous legal standards such as "probable cause"

and "reasonable suspicion," so we must trust them to deter-mine whether a group of loiterers contains individuals (in

this case members of criminal street gangs) whom the cityhas determined threaten the public peace. See

Ornelas v.
United States, 517 U. S. 690, 695, 700 (1996) ("Articulating
precisely what `reasonable suspicion' and `probable cause'mean is not possible. They are commonsense, nontechnical

conceptions that deal with the factual and practical consider-ations of everyday life on which reasonable and prudent men,
not legal technicians, act. . . . [O]ur cases have recognizedthat a police officer may draw inferences based on his own
experience in deciding whether probable cause exists" (citations and internal quotation marks omitted)). In sum, the
Court's conclusion that the ordinance is impermissibly vague
because it " `necessarily entrusts lawmaking to the momentto-moment judgment of the policeman on his beat,' " ante,
at 60, cannot be reconciled with common sense, longstanding police practice, or this Court's Fourth Amendment
jurisprudence.

The illogic of the Court's position becomes apparent when
it opines that the ordinance's dispersal provision "would no
doubt be sufficient if the ordinance only applied to loitering
that had an apparently harmful purpose or effect, or possibly
if it only applied to loitering by persons reasonably believed
to be criminal gang members." Ante, at 62 (footnote omitted). See also ante, at 67 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part
and concurring in judgment) (endorsing Court's proposal).
With respect, if the Court believes that the ordinance is
vague as written, this suggestion would not cure the vagueness problem. First, although the Court has suggested that
a scienter requirement may mitigate a vagueness problem
"with respect to the adequacy of notice to the complainant
that his conduct is proscribed," Hoffman Estates v. Flipside,
Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U. S. 489, 499 (1982) (footnote
omitted), the alternative proposal does not incorporate a scienter requirement. If the ordinance's prohibition were lim527US1 Unit: $U70 [05-09-01 12:56:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Thomas, J., dissenting
ited to loitering with "an apparently harmful purpose," the
criminality of the conduct would continue to depend on its
external appearance, rather than the loiterer's state of mind.
See Black's Law Dictionary 1345 (6th ed. 1990) (scienter "is
frequently used to signify the defendant's guilty knowledge"). For this reason, the proposed alternative would neither satisfy the standard suggested in Hoffman Estates nor
serve to channel police discretion. Indeed, an ordinance
that required officers to ascertain whether a group of loiterers have "an apparently harmful purpose" would require
them to exercise more discretion, not less. Furthermore,
the ordinance in its current form--requiring the dispersal of
groups that contain at least one gang member--actually
vests less discretion in the police than would a law requiring
that the police disperse groups that contain only gang members. Currently, an officer must reasonably suspect that one
individual is a member of a gang. Under the plurality's proposed law, an officer would be required to make such a determination multiple times.

In concluding that the ordinance adequately channels police discretion, I do not suggest that a police officer enforcing
the Gang Congregation Ordinance will never make a mistake. Nor do I overlook the possibility that a police officer,
acting in bad faith, might enforce the ordinance in an arbitrary or discriminatory way. But our decisions should not
turn on the proposition that such an event will be anything
but rare. Instances of arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement of the ordinance, like any other law, are best addressed
when (and if) they arise, rather than prophylactically
through the disfavored mechanism of a facial challenge on
vagueness grounds. See United States v. Salerno, 481 U. S.
739, 745 (1987) ("A facial challenge to a legislative Act is, of
course, the most difficult challenge to mount successfully,
since the challenger must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid").

The plurality's conclusion that the ordinance "fails to give
the ordinary citizen adequate notice of what is forbidden and
what is permitted," ante, at 60, is similarly untenable.
There is nothing "vague" about an order to disperse.9
While "we can never expect mathematical certainty from our
language," Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U. S. 104, 110
(1972), it is safe to assume that the vast majority of people
who are ordered by the police to "disperse and remove themselves from the area" will have little difficulty understanding
how to comply. App. to Pet. for Cert. 61a.

Assuming that we are also obligated to consider whether
the ordinance places individuals on notice of what conduct
might subject them to such an order, respondents in this facial challenge bear the weighty burden of establishing that
the statute is vague in all its applications, "in the sense that
no standard of conduct is specified at all." Coates v. Cincinnati, 402 U. S. 611, 614 (1971). I subscribe to the view of
retired Justice White--"If any fool would know that a particular category of conduct would be within the reach of the
statute, if there is an unmistakable core that a reasonable
person would know is forbidden by the law, the enactment
is not unconstitutional on its face." Kolender, 461 U. S., at
370-371 (dissenting opinion). This is certainly such a case.

nature, vague. The plurality purports to distinguish its sweeping condemnation of dispersal orders from Colten v. Kentucky, 407 U. S. 104
(1972), but I see no principled ground for doing so. The logical implication
of the plurality's assertion is that the police can never issue dispersal orders. For example, in the plurality's view, it is apparently unconstitutional for a police officer to ask a group of gawkers to move along in order
to secure a crime scene.

meaning of the word `loiter.' " 177 Ill. 2d, at 451, 687
N. E. 2d, at 61.

Justice Stevens' contrary conclusion is predicated primarily on the erroneous assumption that the ordinance proscribes large amounts of constitutionally protected and/or

innocent conduct. See ante, at 55, 56-57, 60. As already
explained, supra, at 102-106, the ordinance does not proscribe constitutionally protected conduct--there is no fundamental right to loiter. It is also anomalous to characterize
loitering as "innocent" conduct when it has been disfavored
throughout American history. When a category of conduct
has been consistently criminalized, it can hardly be considered "innocent." Similarly, when a term has long been used
to describe criminal conduct, the need to subject it to the
"more stringent vagueness test" suggested in Hoffman Estates, 455 U. S., at 499, dissipates, for there is no risk of a
trap for the unwary. The term "loiter" is no different from
terms such as "fraud," "bribery," and "perjury." We expect
people of ordinary intelligence to grasp the meaning of such

legal terms despite the fact that they are arguably imprecise.10

The plurality also concludes that the definition of the term
loiter--"to remain in any one place with no apparent pur10 For example, a 1764 Georgia law declared that "all able bodied
persons . . . who shall be found loitering . . . , all other idle vagrants, or
disorderly persons wandering abroad without betaking themselves to
some lawful employment or honest labor, shall be deemed and adjudged
vagabonds," and required the apprehension of "any such vagabond . . .
found within any county in this State, wandering, strolling, loitering
about" (reprinted in First Laws of the State of Georgia, Part 1, 376-377
(J. Cushing comp. 1981)). See also, e. g., Digest of Laws of Pennsylvania

provide adequate notice.11 "It is difficult to imagine," the
plurality posits, "how any citizen of the city of Chicago
standing in a public place . . . would know if he or she had
an `apparent purpose.' " Ante, at 56-57. The plurality underestimates the intellectual capacity of the citizens of Chicago. Persons of ordinary intelligence are perfectly capable
of evaluating how outsiders perceive their conduct, and here
"[i]t is self-evident that there is a whole range of conduct
that anyone with at least a semblance of common sense
would know is [loitering] and that would be covered by the
statute." See Smith v. Goguen, 415 U. S. 566, 584 (1974)
(White, J., concurring in judgment). Members of a group
standing on the corner staring blankly into space, for example, are likely well aware that passersby would conclude that
they have "no apparent purpose." In any event, because
this is a facial challenge, the plurality's ability to hypothesize
that some individuals, in some circumstances, may be unable
to ascertain how their actions appear to outsiders is irrelevant to our analysis. Here, we are asked to determine
whether the ordinance is "vague in all of its applications."

LILLY v. VIRGINIA
certiorari to the supreme court of virginia
No. 98-5881. Argued March 29, 1999--Decided June 10, 1999
Petitioner, his brother Mark, and Gary Barker were arrested at the end

of a 2-day crime spree, during which they, inter alia, stole liquor and
guns and abducted Alex DeFilippis, who was later shot and killed.
Under police questioning, Mark admitted stealing alcoholic beverages,
but claimed that petitioner and Barker stole the guns and that petitioner
shot DeFilippis. When Virginia called Mark as a witness at petitioner's
subsequent criminal trial, Mark invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege
against self-incrimination. The trial court then admitted his statements to the police as declarations of an unavailable witness against
penal interest, overruling petitioner's objections that the statements
were not against Mark's penal interest because they shifted responsibility for the crimes to Barker and petitioner, and that their admission
would violate the Sixth Amendment's Confrontation Clause. Petitioner
was convicted of the DeFilippis murder and other crimes. In affirming,
the Virginia Supreme Court found that the Confrontation Clause was
satisfied because Mark's statements fell within a firmly rooted exception
to the hearsay rule. The court also held that the statements were reliable because Mark knew that he was implicating himself as a participant
in numerous crimes and because the statements were independently
corroborated by other evidence at trial.

Held: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.
255 Va. 558, 499 S. E. 2d 522, reversed and remanded.

Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to
Parts I, II, and VI, concluding:

1. This Court has jurisdiction over petitioner's Confrontation Clause
claim. He expressly argued the claim in his opening brief to the Virginia Supreme Court; and his arguments based on Williamson v. United
States, 512 U. S. 594, and the Confrontation Clause opinion of Lee v.
Illinois, 476 U. S. 530, in responding to the Commonwealth's position,
sufficed to raise the issue in that court. P. 123.

2. The admission of Mark's untested confession violated petitioner's
Confrontation Clause rights. Adhering to this Court's general custom
of allowing state courts initially to assess the effect of erroneously admitted evidence in light of substantive state criminal law, the Virginia
courts are to consider in the first instance whether this Sixth Amend527US1 Unit: $U71 [05-07-01 15:50:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ment violation was "harmless beyond a reasonable doubt." Chapman
v. California, 386 U. S. 18, 24. Pp. 139-140.

Justice Stevens, joined by Justice Souter, Justice Ginsburg,
and Justice Breyer, concluded in Parts III, IV, and V that Mark's
hearsay statements do not meet the requirements for admission set
forth in Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U. S. 56, 66. Pp. 123-139.

(a) The Confrontation Clause ensures the reliability of evidence
against a defendant by subjecting it to rigorous testing in an adversary proceeding, Maryland v. Craig, 497 U. S. 836, 845, as by crossexamination of a declarant, see California v. Green, 399 U. S. 149, 158.
Hearsay statements are sufficiently dependable to allow their untested
admission against an accused only when (1) the statements fall "within
a firmly rooted hearsay exception" or (2) they contain "particularized
guarantees of trustworthiness" such that adversarial testing would be
expected to add little, if anything, to their reliability. Roberts, 448
U. S., at 66. Pp. 123-125.

(b) Statements are admissible under a "firmly rooted" hearsay exception when they fall within a hearsay category whose conditions have
proved over time "to remove all temptation to falsehood, and to enforce
as strict an adherence to the truth as would the obligation of an oath"
and cross-examination at a trial. Mattox v. United States, 156 U. S.
237, 244. The simple categorization of a statement as "against penal
interest" defines too large a class for meaningful Confrontation Clause
review. Such statements are offered into evidence (1) as voluntary admissions against the declarant; (2) as exculpatory evidence offered by a
defendant who claims that the declarant committed, or was involved in,
the offense; and (3) as evidence offered by the prosecution to establish
the guilt of an alleged accomplice of the declarant. The third category,
which includes statements such as Mark's, encompasses statements that
are presumptively unreliable, Lee, 476 U. S., at 541, even when the accomplice incriminates himself together with the defendant. Accomplice
statements that shift or spread blame to a criminal defendant, therefore,
fall outside the realm of those "hearsay exception[s] [that are] so trustworthy that adversarial testing can be expected to add little to [the
statements'] reliability." White v. Illinois, 502 U. S. 346, 357. Such
statements are not within a firmly rooted exception to the hearsay
rule. Pp. 125-134.

(c) The Commonwealth contends that this Court should defer to the
Virginia Supreme Court's additional determination that Mark's statements were reliable and that the indicia of reliability the court found,
coupled with the actions of police during Mark's interrogation, demonstrate that the circumstances surrounding his statements bore "particularized guarantees of trustworthiness," Roberts, 448 U. S., at 66, suffi527US1 Unit: $U71 [05-07-01 15:50:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN

cient to satisfy the Confrontation Clause's residual admissibility test.
Nothing in this Court's prior opinions, however, suggests that appellate
courts should defer to lower court determinations regarding mixed
questions of constitutional law such as whether a hearsay statement has
sufficient guarantees of trustworthiness. See Ornelas v. United States,
517 U. S. 690, 697. Thus, courts should independently review whether
the government's proffered guarantees of trustworthiness satisfy the
Clause. Here, the Commonwealth's asserted trustworthiness guarantees are unconvincing. Mark was in custody for his involvement in, and
knowledge of, serious crimes. He made his statements under governmental authorities' supervision, and was primarily responding to the
officers' leading questions. He also had a natural motive to attempt
to exculpate himself and was under the influence of alcohol during the
interrogation. Each of these factors militates against finding that his
statements were so inherently reliable that cross-examination would
have been superfluous. Pp. 135-139.

Justice Scalia concluded that introducing Mark Lilly's taperecorded statements to police at trial without making him available for
cross-examination is a paradigmatic Confrontation Clause violation.
Since the violation is clear, the case need be remanded only for a
harmless-error determination. P. 143.

Justice Thomas, while adhering to his view that the Confrontation
Clause extends to any witness who actually testifies at trial and is implicated by extrajudicial statements only insofar as they are contained in
formalized testimonial material, such as affidavits, depositions, prior testimony, or confessions, White v. Illinois, 502 U. S. 346, 365, agrees with
The Chief Justice that the Clause does not impose a blanket ban on
the use of accomplice statements that incriminate a defendant and that,
since the lower courts did not analyze the confession under the second
prong of the Roberts inquiry, the plurality should not address that issue
here. Pp. 143-144.

The Chief Justice, joined by Justice O'Connor and Justice
Kennedy, concluded:

1. Mark Lilly's confession incriminating petitioner does not satisfy a
firmly rooted hearsay exception because the statements in his 50-page
confession which are against his penal interest are quite separate from
the statements exculpating him and inculpating petitioner, which are
not in the least against his penal interest. This case, therefore, does
not raise the question whether the Confrontation Clause permits the
admission of a genuinely self-inculpatory statement that also inculpates
a codefendant. Not only were the confession's incriminating portions
not a declaration against penal interest, but these statements were part
of a custodial confession of the sort that this Court has viewed with

special suspicion given a codefendant's strong motivation to implicate
the defendant and exonerate himself. Lee v. Illinois, 476 U. S. 530, 541.
A blanket ban on the government's use of accomplice statements that
incriminate a defendant sweeps beyond this case's facts and this Court's
precedents. Pp. 144-148.

2. The Virginia Supreme Court did not analyze the confession under
the second prong of the Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U. S. 56, inquiry, so the
case should be remanded for the Commonwealth to demonstrate that
the confession bears "particularized guarantees of trustworthiness" and,
if any error is found, to determine whether that error is harmless.

120 LILLY v. VIRGINIA

Opinion of the Court
Justice Stevens announced the judgment of the Courtand delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts

I, II, and VI, and an opinion with respect to Parts III, IV,and V, in which

Justice Souter, Justice Ginsburg, and
Justice Breyer join.

The question presented in this case is whether the ac-cused's Sixth Amendment right "to be confronted with the

witnesses against him" was violated by admitting into evi-dence at his trial a nontestifying accomplice's entire confession that contained some statements against the accomplice'spenal interest and others that inculpated the accused.

I
On December 4, 1995, three men--Benjamin Lee Lilly(petitioner), his brother Mark, and Mark's roommate, Gary

Wayne Barker--broke into a home and stole nine bottles ofliquor, three loaded guns, and a safe. The next day, the men
drank the stolen liquor, robbed a small country store, andshot at geese with their stolen weapons. After their car
broke down, they abducted Alex DeFilippis and used his vehicle to drive to a deserted location. One of them shot andkilled DeFilippis. The three men then committed two more

robberies before they were apprehended by the police latein the evening of December 5.

After taking them into custody, the police questioned eachof the three men separately. Petitioner did not mention the
murder to the police and stated that the other two men hadforced him to participate in the robberies. Petitioner's
brother Mark and Barker told the police somewhat different
accounts of the crimes, but both maintained that petitioner

Opinion of the Court
masterminded the robberies and was the one who hadkilled DeFilippis.

A tape recording of Mark's initial oral statement indicatesthat he was questioned from 1:35 a.m. until 2:12 a.m. on December 6. The police interrogated him again from 2:30 a.m.
until 2:53 a.m. During both interviews, Mark continuallyemphasized how drunk he had been during the entire spree.

When asked about his participation in the string of crimes,Mark admitted that he stole liquor during the initial burglary
and that he stole a 12-pack of beer during the robbery of theliquor store. Mark also conceded that he had handled a gun
earlier that day and that he was present during the more
serious thefts and the homicide.

The police told Mark that he would be charged with armed
robbery and that, unless he broke "family ties," petitioner
"may be dragging you right in to a life sentence," App. 257.
Mark acknowledged that he would be sent away to the penitentiary. He claimed, however, that while he had primarily
been drinking, petitioner and Barker had "got some guns or
something" during the initial burglary. Id., at 250. Mark
said that Barker had pulled a gun in one of the robberies.
He further insisted that petitioner had instigated the carjacking and that he (Mark) "didn't have nothing to do with
the shooting" of DeFilippis. Id., at 256. In a brief portion
of one of his statements, Mark stated that petitioner was the
one who shot DeFilippis.

The Commonwealth of Virginia charged petitioner with
several offenses, including the murder of DeFilippis, and
tried him separately. At trial, the Commonwealth called
Mark as a witness, but he invoked his Fifth Amendment
privilege against self-incrimination. The Commonwealth
therefore offered to introduce into evidence the statements
Mark made to the police after his arrest, arguing that they
were admissible as declarations of an unavailable witness
against penal interest. Petitioner objected on the ground
that the statements were not actually against Mark's penal

122 LILLY v. VIRGINIA

Opinion of the Court
interest because they shifted responsibility for the crimes
to Barker and to petitioner, and that their admission would
violate the Sixth Amendment's Confrontation Clause. The
trial judge overruled the objection and admitted the tape
recordings and written transcripts of the statements in their
entirety. The jury found petitioner guilty of robbery, abduction, carjacking, possession of a firearm by a felon, and four
charges of illegal use of a firearm, for which offenses he
received consecutive prison sentences of two life terms plus
27 years. The jury also convicted petitioner of capital murder and recommended a sentence of death, which the court
imposed.

The Supreme Court of Virginia affirmed petitioner's convictions and sentences. As is relevant here, the court first
concluded that Mark's statements were declarations of an unavailable witness against penal interest; that the statements'
reliability was established by other evidence; and, therefore,
that they fell within an exception to the Virginia hearsay
rule. The court then turned to petitioner's Confrontation
Clause challenge. It began by relying on our opinion in
White v. Illinois, 502 U. S. 346 (1992), for the proposition
that " `[w]here proffered hearsay has sufficient guarantees of
reliability to come within a firmly rooted exception to the
hearsay rule, the Confrontation Clause is satisfied.' " 255
Va. 558, 574, 499 S. E. 2d 522, 534 (1998) (quoting White, 502
U. S., at 356). The Virginia court also remarked:

"[A]dmissiblity into evidence of the statement against
penal interest of an unavailable witness is a `firmly
rooted' exception to the hearsay rule in Virginia. Thus,
we hold that the trial court did not err in admitting
Mark Lilly's statements into evidence." 255 Va., at 575,
499 S. E. 2d, at 534.

"That Mark Lilly's statements were self-serving, in that
they tended to shift principal responsibility to others or
to offer claims of mitigating circumstances, goes to the

Opinion of Stevens, J.
weight the jury could assign to them and not to theiradmissibility." Id., at 574, 499 S. E. 2d, at 534.

Our concern that this decision represented a significantdeparture from our Confrontation Clause jurisprudence
prompted us to grant certiorari. 525 U. S. 981 (1998).

II
As an initial matter, the Commonwealth asserts that weshould decline to exercise jurisdiction over petitioner's claim

because he did not fairly present his Confrontation Clausechallenge to the Supreme Court of Virginia. We disagree.
Although petitioner focused on state hearsay law in his chal-lenge to the admission of Mark's statements, petitioner expressly argued in his opening brief to that court that theadmission of the statements violated his Sixth Amendment
right to confrontation. He expanded his Sixth Amendmentargument in his reply brief and cited Lee v. Illinois, 476 U. S.
530 (1986), and Williamson v. United States, 512 U. S. 594(1994), in response to the Commonwealth's contention that
the admission of the statements was constitutional. Thesearguments, particularly the reliance on our Confrontation
Clause opinion in Lee, sufficed to raise in the Supreme Courtof Virginia the constitutionality of admitting Mark's statements. See Taylor v. Illinois, 484 U. S. 400, 406, n. 9 (1988).Indeed, the court addressed petitioner's Confrontation
Clause claim without mentioning any waiver problems.

III
In all criminal prosecutions, state as well as federal, theaccused has a right, guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth

Amendments to the United States Constitution, "to beconfronted with the witnesses against him." U. S. Const.,
Amdt. 6; Pointer v. Texas, 380 U. S. 400 (1965) (applyingSixth Amendment to the States). "The central concern of
the Confrontation Clause is to ensure the reliability of theevidence against a criminal defendant by subjecting it to rig527US1 Unit: $U71 [05-07-01 15:50:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN

orous testing in the context of an adversary proceeding be-fore the trier of fact." Maryland v. Craig, 497 U. S. 836, 845

(1990). When the government seeks to offer a declarant'sout-of-court statements against the accused, and, as in this
case, the declarant is unavailable,1 courts must decidewhether the Clause permits the government to deny the accused his usual right to force the declarant "to submit tocross-examination, the `greatest legal engine ever invented
for the discovery of truth.' " California v. Green, 399 U. S.149, 158 (1970) (footnote and citation omitted).

In our most recent case interpreting the Confrontation
Clause, White v. Illinois, 502 U. S. 346 (1992), we rejectedthe suggestion that the Clause should be narrowly construed

to apply only to practices comparable to "a particular abuse
common in 16th- and 17th-century England: prosecuting adefendant through the presentation of

ex parte affidavits,
without the affiants ever being produced at trial." Id.,at 352. This abuse included using out-of-court depositions

and " `confessions of accomplices.' " Green, 399 U. S., at 157.Accord,

White, 502 U. S., at 361, 363 (Thomas, J., concurring
in part and concurring in judgment) (noting that this ruleapplies even if the confession is "found to be reliable"). Because that restrictive reading of the Clause's term "witnesses" would have virtually eliminated the Clause's role inrestricting the admission of hearsay testimony, we considered it foreclosed by our prior cases. Instead, we adheredto our general framework, summarized in

Ohio v. Roberts,
448 U. S. 56 (1980), that the veracity of hearsay statementsis sufficiently dependable to allow the untested admission of

such statements against an accused when (1) "the evidence

1 Petitioner suggests in his merits brief that Mark was not truly "unavailable" because the Commonwealth could have tried and sentenced him
before petitioner's trial, thereby extinguishing Mark's Fifth Amendment
privilege. We assume, however, as petitioner did in framing his petition
for certiorari, that to the extent it is relevant, Mark was an unavailable
witness for Confrontation Clause purposes.

Opinion of Stevens, J.
falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception" or (2) it con-tains "particularized guarantees of trustworthiness" such

that adversarial testing would be expected to add little, ifanything, to the statements' reliability. Id., at 66.

Before turning to the dual Roberts inquiries, however, wenote that the statements taken from petitioner's brother in
the early morning of December 6 were obviously obtainedfor the purpose of creating evidence that would be useful at
a future trial. The analogy to the presentation of ex parteaffidavits in the early English proceedings thus brings the
Confrontation Clause into play no matter how narrowly itsgateway might be read.

IV
The Supreme Court of Virginia held that the admission ofMark Lilly's confession was constitutional primarily because,

in its view, it was against Mark's penal interest and because"the statement against penal interest of an unavailable
witness is a `firmly rooted' exception to the hearsay rule inVirginia." 255 Va., at 575, 449 S. E. 2d, at 534. We assume,
as we must, that Mark's statements were against his penalinterest as a matter of state law, but the question whether
the statements fall within a firmly rooted hearsay exceptionfor Confrontation Clause purposes is a question of federal
law. Accordingly, it is appropriate to begin our analysis byexamining the "firmly rooted" doctrine and the roots of the
"against penal interest" exception.We have allowed the admission of statements falling
within a firmly rooted hearsay exception since the Court'srecognition in Mattox v. United States, 156 U. S. 237 (1895),
that the Framers of the Sixth Amendment "obviously in-tended to . . . respec[t]" certain unquestionable rules of evidence in drafting the Confrontation Clause. Id., at 243.Justice Brown, writing for the Court in that case, did not
question the wisdom of excluding deposition testimony, ex
parte affidavits and their equivalents. But he reasoned thatan unduly strict and "technical" reading of the Clause would

527US1 Unit: $U71 [05-07-01 15:50:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN
126 LILLY v. VIRGINIA

Opinion of Stevens, J.
have the effect of excluding other hearsay evidence, such asdying declarations, whose admissibility neither the Framers

nor anyone else 100 years later "would have [had] thehardihood . . . to question."

Ibid.
We now describe a hearsay exception as "firmly rooted" if,
in light of "longstanding judicial and legislative experience,"
Idaho v. Wright, 497 U. S. 805, 817 (1990), it "rest[s] [on] such
[a] solid foundatio[n] that admission of virtually any evidencewithin [it] comports with the `substance of the constitutional

protection.' " Roberts, 448 U. S., at 66 (quoting Mattox, 156U. S., at 244). This standard is designed to allow the introduction of statements falling within a category of hearsay
whose conditions have proved over time "to remove all
temptation to falsehood, and to enforce as strict an adherence to the truth as would the obligation of an oath" and
cross-examination at a trial. Ibid. In White, for instance,
we held that the hearsay exception for spontaneous declarations is firmly rooted because it "is at least two centuries
old," currently "widely accepted among the States," and carries "substantial guarantees of . . . trustworthiness . . . [that]
cannot be recaptured even by later in-court testimony." 502
U. S., at 355-356, and n. 8. Established practice, in short,
must confirm that statements falling within a category of
hearsay inherently "carr[y] special guarantees of credibility"
essentially equivalent to, or greater than, those produced by
the Constitution's preference for cross-examined trial testimony. Id., at 356.

The "against penal interest" exception to the hearsay
rule--unlike other previously recognized firmly rooted exceptions--is not generally based on the maxim that statements made without a motive to reflect on the legal consequences of one's statement, and in situations that are
exceptionally conducive to veracity, lack the dangers of inaccuracy that typically accompany hearsay. The exception,
rather, is founded on the broad assumption "that a person is
unlikely to fabricate a statement against his own interest at

Opinion of Stevens, J.
the time it is made." Chambers v. Mississippi, 410 U. S.284, 299 (1973).

We have previously noted that, due to the sweeping scopeof the label, the simple categorization of a statement as a
" `declaration against penal interest' . . . defines too large a
class for meaningful Confrontation Clause analysis." Lee v.
Illinois, 476 U. S., at 544, n. 5. In criminal trials, statements against penal interest are offered into evidence inthree principal situations: (1) as voluntary admissions

against the declarant; (2) as exculpatory evidence offered bya defendant who claims that the declarant committed, or was
involved in, the offense; and (3) as evidence offered by the
prosecution to establish the guilt of an alleged accomplice of
the declarant. It is useful to consider the three categories
and their roots separately.

Statements in the first category--voluntary admissions of
the declarant--are routinely offered into evidence against
the maker of the statement and carry a distinguished heritage confirming their admissibility when so used. See
G. Gilbert, Evidence 139-140 (1756); Lambe's Case, 2 Leach
552, 168 Eng. Rep. 379 (1791); State v. Kirby, 1 Strob. 155,
156 (1846); State v. Cowan, 29 N. C. 239, 246 (1847). Thus,
assuming that Mark Lilly's statements were taken in conformance with constitutional prerequisites, they would unquestionably be admissible against him if he were on trial
for stealing alcoholic beverages.

If Mark were a codefendant in a joint trial, however, even
the use of his confession to prove his guilt might have an
adverse impact on the rights of his accomplices. When dealing with admissions against penal interest, we have taken
great care to separate using admissions against the declarant
(the first category above) from using them against other
criminal defendants (the third category).

In Bruton v. United States, 391 U. S. 123 (1968), two codefendants, Evans and Bruton, were tried jointly and convicted of armed postal robbery. A postal inspector testified

527US1 Unit: $U71 [05-07-01 15:50:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN
128 LILLY v. VIRGINIA

Opinion of Stevens, J.
that Evans had orally confessed that he and Bruton had com-mitted the crime. The jury was instructed that Evans' confession was admissible against him, but could not be consid-ered in assessing Bruton's guilt. Despite that instruction,
this Court concluded that the introduction of Evans' confession posed such a serious threat to Bruton's right to confrontand cross-examine the witnesses against him that he was

entitled to a new trial. The case is relevant to the issuebefore us today, not because of its principal holding concerning the ability or inability of the jury to follow the judge'sinstruction, but rather because it was common ground among
all of the Justices that the fact that the confession was a
statement against the penal interest of Evans did not justify
its use against Bruton. As Justice White noted at the outset of his dissent, "nothing in that confession which was relevant and material to Bruton's case was admissible against
Bruton." Id., at 138.

In the years since Bruton was decided, we have reviewed
a number of cases in which one defendant's confession has
been introduced into evidence in a joint trial pursuant to
instructions that it could be used against him but not against
his codefendant. Despite frequent disagreement over matters such as the adequacy of the trial judge's instructions, or
the sufficiency of the redaction of ambiguous references to
the declarant's accomplice, we have consistently either stated
or assumed that the mere fact that one accomplice's confession qualified as a statement against his penal interest did
not justify its use as evidence against another person. See
Gray v. Maryland, 523 U. S. 185, 194-195 (1998) (stating that
because the use of an accomplice's confession "creates a special, and vital, need for cross-examination," a prosecutor desiring to offer such evidence must comply with Bruton, hold
separate trials, use separate juries, or abandon the use of the
confession); 523 U. S., at 200 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (stating
that codefendant's confessions "may not be considered for the
purpose of determining [the defendant's] guilt"); Richardson

v. Marsh, 481 U. S. 200, 206 (1987) ("[W]here two defendantsare tried jointly, the pretrial confession of one cannot be admitted against the other unless the confessing defendanttakes the stand"); Cruz v. New York, 481 U. S. 186, 189-190,
193 (1987) (same).The second category of statements against penal interest
encompasses those offered as exculpatory evidence by a de-fendant who claims that it was the maker of the statement,
rather than he, who committed (or was involved in) the crimein question. In this context, our Court, over the dissent of
Justice Holmes, originally followed the 19th-century Englishrule that categorically refused to recognize any "against
penal interest" exception to the hearsay rule, holding insteadthat under federal law only hearsay statements against pecuniary (and perhaps proprietary) interest were sufficiently re-liable to warrant their admission at the trial of someone
other than the declarant. See Donnelly v. United States,228 U. S. 243, 272-277 (1913). Indeed, most States adhered
to this approach well into the latter half of the 20th century.See

Chambers, 410 U. S., at 299 (collecting citations).As time passed, however, the precise Donnelly rule, which

barred the admission of other persons' confessions that ex-culpated the accused, became the subject of increasing criticism. Professor Wigmore, for example, remarked yearsafter Donnelly:

"The only practical consequences of this unreasoninglimitation are shocking to the sense of justice; for, in its
commonest application, it requires, in a criminal trial,the rejection of a confession, however well authenticated, of a person deceased or insane or fled from thejurisdiction (and therefore quite unavailable) who has
avowed himself to be the true culprit. . . . It is thereforenot too late to retrace our steps, and to discard this barbarous doctrine, which would refuse to let an innocentaccused vindicate himself even by producing to the tribunal a perfectly authenticated written confession, made

Wright, Uniform Rules and Hearsay, 26 U. Cin. L. Rev. 575(1957).

Finally, in 1973, this Court endorsed the more enlightenedview in

Chambers, holding that the Due Process Clauseaffords criminal defendants the right to introduce into

evidence third parties' declarations against penal interest--their confessions--when the circumstances surrounding the
statements "provid[e] considerable assurance of their relia-bility." 410 U. S., at 300. Not surprisingly, most States
have now amended their hearsay rules to allow the admis-sion of such statements under against-penal-interest exceptions. See 5 J. Wigmore, Evidence $ 1476, p. 352, and n. 9(J. Chadbourn rev. 1974);

id., $ 1477, at 360, and n. 7;J. Wigmore, Evidence $$ 1476 and 1477, pp. 618-626 (A. Best

ed. Supp. 1998). But because hearsay statements of thissort are, by definition, offered by the accused, the admission
of such statements does not implicate Confrontation Clauseconcerns. Thus, there is no need to decide whether the reliability of such statements is so inherently dependable thatthey would constitute a firmly rooted hearsay exception.

The third category includes cases, like the one before ustoday, in which the government seeks to introduce "a confession by an accomplice which incriminates a criminal defend-ant." Lee, 476 U. S., at 544, n. 5. The practice of admitting
statements in this category under an exception to the hear-say rule--to the extent that such a practice exists in certain
jurisdictions--is, unlike the first category or even the sec-ond, of quite recent vintage. This category also typically

527US1 Unit: $U71 [05-07-01 15:50:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN

131Cite as: 527 U. S. 116 (1999)
Opinion of Stevens, J.
includes statements that, when offered in the absence of

the declarant, function similarly to those used in the ancient
ex parte affidavit system.

Most important, this third category of hearsay encompasses statements that are inherently unreliable. Typical of
the ground swell of scholarly and judicial criticism that culminated in the Chambers decision, Wigmore's treatise still
expressly distinguishes accomplices' confessions that inculpate themselves and the accused as beyond a proper understanding of the against-penal-interest exception because
an accomplice often has a considerable interest in "confessing and betraying his cocriminals." 5 Wigmore, Evidence

$ 1477, at 358, n. 1 (J. Chadbourn rev. 1974). Consistent with
this scholarship and the assumption that underlies the analysis in our Bruton line of cases, we have over the years "spoken with one voice in declaring presumptively unreliable accomplices' confessions that incriminate defendants." Lee,
476 U. S., at 541. See also Cruz, 481 U. S., at 195 (White, J.,
dissenting) (such statements "have traditionally been viewed
with special suspicion"); Bruton, 391 U. S., at 136 (such statements are "inevitably suspect").

In Crawford v. United States, 212 U. S. 183 (1909), this
Court stated that even when an alleged accomplice testifies,
his confession that "incriminate[s] himself together with
defendant . . . ought to be received with suspicion, and with
the very greatest care and caution, and ought not to be
passed upon by the jury under the same rules governing
other and apparently credible witnesses." Id., at 204.
Over 30 years ago, we applied this principle to the Sixth
Amendment. We held in Douglas v. Alabama, 380 U. S.
415 (1965), that the admission of a nontestifying accomplice's
confession, which shifted responsibility and implicated the
defendant as the triggerman, "plainly denied [the defendant]
the right of cross-examination secured by the Confrontation
Clause." Id., at 419.

527US1 Unit: $U71 [05-07-01 15:50:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN
132 LILLY v. VIRGINIA

Opinion of Stevens, J.
In Lee, we reaffirmed Douglas and explained that its hold-ing "was premised on the basic understanding that when one

person accuses another of a crime under circumstances inwhich the declarant stands to gain by inculpating another,
the accusation is presumptively suspect and must be sub-jected to the scrutiny of cross-examination." 476 U. S., at
541. This is so because

"th[e] truthfinding function of the Confrontation Clauseis uniquely threatened when an accomplice's confession

is sought to be introduced against a criminal defendantwithout the benefit of cross-examination. . . . `Due to

his strong motivation to implicate the defendant and toexonerate himself, a codefendant's statements about
what the defendant said or did are less credible thanordinary hearsay evidence.' "

Ibid. (quoting Bruton,391 U. S., at 141 (White, J., dissenting)).

Indeed, even the dissenting Justices in Lee agreed that "ac-complice confessions ordinarily are untrustworthy precisely
because they are not unambiguously adverse to the penalinterest of the declarant," but instead are likely to be attempts to minimize the declarant's culpability. 476 U. S., at552-553 (Blackmun, J., dissenting).

2

We have adhered to this approach in construing the Fed-eral Rules of Evidence. Thus, in

Williamson v. United

2 The only arguable exception to this unbroken line of cases arose in our
plurality opinion in Dutton v. Evans, 400 U. S. 74 (1970), in which we held
that the admission of an accomplice's spontaneous comment that indirectly
inculpated the defendant did not violate the Confrontation Clause. While
Justice Stewart's plurality opinion observed that the declarant's statement
was "against his penal interest," id., at 89, the Court's judgment did not
rest on that point, and in no way purported to hold that statements with
such an attribute were presumptively admissible. Rather, the five Justices in the majority emphasized the unique aspects of the case and emphasized that the co-conspirator spontaneously made the statement and "had
no apparent reason to lie." Id., at 86-89. See also id., at 98 (Harlan, J.,
concurring in result).

States, 512 U. S. 594 (1994), without reaching the Confronta-tion Clause issue, we held that an accomplice's statement

against his own penal interest was not admissible against thedefendant.

3 We once again noted the presumptive unreliability of the "non-self-inculpatory" portions of the statement:"One of the most effective ways to lie is to mix falsehood

with truth, especially truth that seems particularly persua-sive because of its self-inculpatory nature."

Id., at 599-601.It is clear that our cases consistently have viewed an accomplice's statements that shift or spread the blame to acriminal defendant as falling outside the realm of those
"hearsay exception[s] [that are] so trustworthy that adver-sarial testing can be expected to add little to [the statements'] reliability." White, 502 U. S., at 357. This view isalso reflected in several States' hearsay law.

4 Indeed, prior

3 Federal Rule of Evidence 804(b)(3) provides an exception to the hearsay rule for the admission of "[a] statement which was at the time of its
making so far contrary to the declarant's pecuniary or proprietary interest, or so far tended to subject the declarant to civil or criminal liability . . .
that a reasonable person in the declarant's position would not have made
the statement unless believing it to be true."

4 Several States provide statutorily that their against-penal-interest

hearsay exceptions do not allow the admission of "[a] statement or confession offered against the accused in a criminal case, made by a codefendant
or other person implicating both himself and the accused." Ark. Rule

to 1995, it appears that even Virginia rarely allowed state-ments against the penal interest of the declarant to be used

at criminal trials. See, e. g., Ellison v. Commonwealth, 219Va. 404, 247 S. E. 2d 685 (1978). That Virginia relaxed that
portion of its hearsay law when it decided Chandler v. Commonwealth, 249 Va. 270, 455 S. E. 2d 219 (1995), and that itlater apparently concluded that all statements against penal

interest fall within "a `firmly rooted' exception to the hearsayrule in Virginia," 255 Va., at 575, 499 S. E. 2d, at 534, is of
no consequence. The decisive fact, which we make explicittoday, is that accomplices' confessions that inculpate a criminal defendant are not within a firmly rooted exception to thehearsay rule as that concept has been defined in our Confrontation Clause jurisprudence.5
918 S. W. 2d 511, 515 (Tex. Crim. App. 1996); In re Anthony Ray, Mc., 200
W. Va. 312, 321, 489 S. E. 2d 289, 298 (1997). Still other States have
virtually no against-penal-interest exception at all. See Ala. Rule Evid.
804(b)(3) (1998) (no such exception); Ga. Code Ann. $ 24-3-8 (1995) (exception only if declarant is deceased and statement was not made with view
toward litigation); State v. Skillicorn, 944 S. W. 2d 877, 884-885 (Mo.) (no
exception), cert. denied, 522 U. S. 999 (1997).

5 Our holdings in Bruton v. United States, 391 U. S. 123 (1968), Cruz v.

New York, 481 U. S. 186 (1987), Gray v. Maryland, 523 U. S. 185 (1998),
and Lee v. Illinois, 476 U. S. 530 (1986), were all premised, explicitly or
implicitly, on the principle that accomplice confessions that inculpate a
criminal defendant are not per se admissible (and thus necessarily fall
outside a firmly rooted hearsay exception), no matter how much those
statements also incriminate the accomplice. If "genuinely" or "equally"
inculpatory confessions of accomplices were--as The Chief Justice's
concurrence suggests is possible, post, at 146--per se admissible against
criminal defendants, then the confessions in each of those cases would
have been admissible, for each confession inculpated the accomplice
equally in the crimes at issue. But the Court in Lee rejected the dissent's
position that a nontestifying accomplice's confessions that are "unambiguously" against the accomplice's penal interest are per se admissible, see
476 U. S., at 552 (Blackmun, J., dissenting) and we ruled in Bruton, Cruz,
and Gray that such equally self-inculpatory statements are inadmissible
against criminal defendants. Today we merely reaffirm these holdings

Aside from its conclusion that Mark's statements were ad-missible under a firmly rooted hearsay exception, the Supreme Court of Virginia also affirmed the trial court's hold-ing that the statements were "reliabl[e] . . . in the context of
the facts and circumstances under which [they were] given"because (i) "Mark Lilly was cognizant of the import of his
statements and that he was implicating himself as a partici-pant in numerous crimes" and (ii) "[e]lements of [his] statements were independently corroborated" by other evidenceoffered at trial. Id., at 574, 499 S. E. 2d, at 534. See also
App. 18 (trial court's decision). The Commonwealth con-tends that we should defer to this "fact-intensive" determination. It further argues that these two indicia of reli-ability, coupled with the facts that the police read Mark
his Miranda rights and did not promise him leniency inexchange for his statements, demonstrate that the circumstances surrounding his statements bore "particularizedguarantees of trustworthiness,"

Roberts, 448 U. S., at 66,sufficient to satisfy the Confrontation Clause's residual admissibility test.6
and make explicit what was heretofore implicit: A statement (like Mark's)
that falls into the category summarized in Lee--"a confession by an accomplice which incriminates a criminal defendant," 476 U. S., at 544, n. 5--
does not come within a firmly rooted hearsay exception.

This, of course, does not mean, as The Chief Justice, post, at 147-148
(opinion concurring in judgment), and Justice Thomas, post, at 143 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment), erroneously suggest,
that the Confrontation Clause imposes a "blanket ban on the government's
use of [nontestifying] accomplice statements that incriminate a defendant." Rather, it simply means that the government must satisfy the second prong of the Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U. S. 56 (1980), test in order to
introduce such statements. See Part V, infra.

6 Although The Chief Justice contends that we should remand this

issue to the Supreme Court of Virginia, see post, at 148-149, it would be
inappropriate to do so because we granted certiorari on this issue, see Pet.
for Cert. i, and the parties have fully briefed and argued the issue. The

136 LILLY v. VIRGINIA

Opinion of Stevens, J.
The residual "trustworthiness" test credits the axiom that
a rigid application of the Clause's standard for admissibility
might in an exceptional case exclude a statement of an unavailable witness that is incontestably probative, competent,
and reliable, yet nonetheless outside of any firmly rooted
hearsay exception. Cf. id., at 63; Mattox, 156 U. S., at 243-
244. When a court can be confident--as in the context of
hearsay falling within a firmly rooted exception--that "the
declarant's truthfulness is so clear from the surrounding circumstances that the test of cross-examination would be of
marginal utility," the Sixth Amendment's residual "trustworthiness" test allows the admission of the declarant's
statements. Wright, 497 U. S., at 820.

Nothing in our prior opinions, however, suggests that
appellate courts should defer to lower courts' determinations
regarding whether a hearsay statement has particularized
guarantees of trustworthiness. To the contrary, those
opinions indicate that we have assumed, as with other

fact-intensive, mixed questions of constitutional law, that
"[i]ndependent review is . . . necessary . . . to maintain control of, and to clarify, the legal principles" governing the factual circumstances necessary to satisfy the protections of the
Bill of Rights. Ornelas v. United States, 517 U. S. 690, 697
(1996) (holding that appellate courts should review reasonable suspicion and probable-cause determinations de novo).
We, of course, accept the Virginia courts' determination that
Mark's statements were reliable for purposes of state hearsay law, and, as should any appellate court, we review the

"facts and circumstances" formula, recited above, that the Virginia courts
already employed in reaching their reliability holdings is virtually identical to the Roberts "particularized guarantees" test, which turns as well on
the "surrounding circumstances" of the statements. Idaho v. Wright, 497
U. S. 805, 820 (1990). Furthermore, as will become clear, the Commonwealth fails to point to any fact regarding this issue that the Supreme
Court of Virginia did not explicitly consider and that requires serious
analysis.

Opinion of Stevens, J.
presence or absence of historical facts for clear error. Butthe surrounding circumstances relevant to a Sixth Amendment admissibility determination do not include the declar-ant's in-court demeanor (otherwise the declarant would
be testifying) or any other factor uniquely suited to the
province of trial courts. For these reasons, when decidingwhether the admission of a declarant's out-of-court statements violates the Confrontation Clause, courts should inde-pendently review whether the government's proffered guarantees of trustworthiness satisfy the demands of the Clause.The Commonwealth correctly notes that "the presumption
of unreliability that attaches to codefendants' confessions
. . . may be rebutted." Lee, 476 U. S., at 543. We have
held, in fact, that any inherent unreliability that accompanies
co-conspirator statements made during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy is per se rebutted by the circumstances giving rise to the long history of admitting such
statements. See Bourjaily v. United States, 483 U. S. 171,
182-184 (1987). Nonetheless, the historical underpinnings
of the Confrontation Clause and the sweep of our prior
confrontation cases offer one cogent reminder: It is highly
unlikely that the presumptive unreliability that attaches to
accomplices' confessions that shift or spread blame can be
effectively rebutted when the statements are given under
conditions that implicate the core concerns of the old ex parte
affidavit practice--that is, when the government is involved
in the statements' production, and when the statements describe past events and have not been subjected to adversarial testing.

Applying these principles, the Commonwealth's asserted
guarantees of trustworthiness fail to convince us that Mark's
confession was sufficiently reliable as to be admissible without allowing petitioner to cross-examine him. That other
evidence at trial corroborated portions of Mark's statements
is irrelevant. We have squarely rejected the notion that
"evidence corroborating the truth of a hearsay statement

527US1 Unit: $U71 [05-07-01 15:50:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN
138 LILLY v. VIRGINIA

Opinion of Stevens, J.
may properly support a finding that the statement bears`particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.' "

Wright,
497 U. S., at 822. In Wright, we concluded that the admis-sion of hearsay statements by a child declarant violated the

Confrontation Clause even though the statements were admissible under an exception to the hearsay rule recognizedin Idaho, and even though they were corroborated by other

evidence. We recognized that it was theoretically possiblefor such statements to possess " `particularized guarantees
of trustworthiness' " that would justify their admissibility,but we refused to allow the State to "bootstrap on" the trustworthiness of other evidence. "To be admissible under the
Confrontation Clause," we held, "hearsay evidence used to
convict a defendant must possess indicia of reliability by virtue of its inherent trustworthiness, not by reference to other
evidence at trial." Ibid.

Nor did the police's informing Mark of his Miranda rights
render the circumstances surrounding his statements significantly more trustworthy. We noted in rejecting a similar argument in Lee that a finding that a confession was "voluntary for Fifth Amendment purposes . . . does not bear on
the question of whether the confession was also free from
any desire, motive, or impulse [the declarant] may have had
either to mitigate the appearance of his own culpability by
spreading the blame or to overstate [the defendant's] involvement" in the crimes at issue. 476 U. S., at 544. By the
same token, we believe that a suspect's consciousness of his
Miranda rights has little, if any, bearing on the likelihood of
truthfulness of his statements. When a suspect is in custody for his obvious involvement in serious crimes, his
knowledge that anything he says may be used against him
militates against depending on his veracity.

The Commonwealth's next proffered basis for reliability--
that Mark knew he was exposing himself to criminal liability--merely restates the fact that portions of his statements
were technically against penal interest. And as we have ex527US1 Unit: $U71 [05-07-01 15:50:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN

139Cite as: 527 U. S. 116 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
plained, such statements are suspect insofar as they incul-pate other persons. "[T]hat a person is making a broadly

self-inculpatory confession does not make more credible theconfession's non-self-inculpatory parts." Williamson, 512
U. S., at 599. Accord, Lee, 476 U. S., at 545. Similarly, theabsence of an express promise of leniency to Mark does not
enhance his statements' reliability to the level necessary fortheir untested admission. The police need not tell a person
who is in custody that his statements may gain him leniencyin order for the suspect to surmise that speaking up, and
particularly placing blame on his cohorts, may inure to hisadvantage.

It is abundantly clear that neither the words that Markspoke nor the setting in which he was questioned provides
any basis for concluding that his comments regarding peti-tioner's guilt were so reliable that there was no need to subject them to adversarial testing in a trial setting. Mark wasin custody for his involvement in, and knowledge of, serious
crimes and made his statements under the supervision ofgovernmental authorities. He was primarily responding

to the officers' leading questions, which were asked withoutany contemporaneous cross-examination by adverse parties.
Thus, Mark had a natural motive to attempt to exculpatehimself as much as possible. See

id., at 544-545; Dutton v.Evans, 400 U. S. 74, 98 (1970) (Harlan, J., concurring in result). Mark also was obviously still under the influence ofalcohol. Each of these factors militates against finding that
his statements were so inherently reliable that cross-examination would have been superfluous.

The admission of the untested confession of Mark Lilly vio-lated petitioner's Confrontation Clause rights. Adhering to

our general custom of allowing state courts initially to assessthe effect of erroneously admitted evidence in light of substantive state criminal law, we leave it to the Virginia courts

As currently interpreted, the Confrontation Clause gener-ally forbids the introduction of hearsay into a trial unless the

evidence "falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception" orotherwise possesses "particularized guarantees of trustworthiness." Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U. S. 56, 66 (1980). Amici in
this case, citing opinions of Justices of this Court and thework of scholars, have argued that we should reexamine the

way in which our cases have connected the ConfrontationClause and the hearsay rule. See Brief for American Civil
Liberties Union et al. as Amici Curiae 2-3; see also, e. g.,
White v. Illinois, 502 U. S. 346, 358 (1992) (Thomas, J., joined

Prosecutorial Restraint Model, 76 Minn. L. Rev. 557 (1992).The Court's effort to tie the Clause so directly to the hearsay rule is of fairly recent vintage, compare Roberts, supra,with

California v. Green, 399 U. S. 149, 155-156 (1970), while
the Confrontation Clause itself has ancient origins that pre-date the hearsay rule, see

Salinger v. United States, 272
U. S. 542, 548 (1926) ("The right of confrontation did not originate with the provision in the Sixth Amendment, but wasa common-law right having recognized exceptions"). The

of the Common Law of England 163-164 (C. Gray ed. 1971);3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *373. As traditionally understood, the right was designed to prevent, for example, the
kind of abuse that permitted the Crown to convict Sir Walter
Raleigh of treason on the basis of the out-of-court confession
of Lord Cobham, a co-conspirator. See 30 Wright & Graham, supra, $ 6342, at 258-269.

Viewed in light of its traditional purposes, the current,
hearsay-based Confrontation Clause test, amici argue, is
both too narrow and too broad. The test is arguably too
narrow insofar as it authorizes the admission of out-of-court
statements prepared as testimony for a trial when such
statements happen to fall within some well-recognized hearsay rule exception. For example, a deposition or videotaped
confession sometimes could fall within the exception for
vicarious admissions or, in The Chief Justice's view, the
exception for statements against penal interest. See post, at
145-146. See generally White, supra, at 364-365 (Thomas,
J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); Friedman,
supra, at 1025; Amar, supra, at 129; Berger, supra, at 596-

602; Brief for American Civil Liberties Union et al. as Amici
Curiae 16-20. But why should a modern Lord Cobham's
out-of-court confession become admissible simply because of
a fortuity, such as the conspiracy having continued through
the time of police questioning, thereby bringing the confession within the "well-established" exception for the vicarious
admissions of a co-conspirator? Cf. Dutton v. Evans, 400

Breyer, J., concurring
U. S. 74, 83 (1970) (plurality opinion). Or why should we,
like Walter Raleigh's prosecutor, deny a plea to "let my Accuser come face to face," with words (now related to the
penal interest exception) such as, "The law presumes, a man
will not accuse himself to accuse another"? Trial of Sir
Walter Raleigh, 2 How. St. Tr. 19 (1816).

At the same time, the current hearsay-based Confrontation Clause test is arguably too broad. It would make a
constitutional issue out of the admission of any relevant
hearsay statement, even if that hearsay statement is only
tangentially related to the elements in dispute, or was made
long before the crime occurred and without relation to the
prospect of a future trial. It is not obvious that admission
of a business record, which is hearsay because the business
was not "regularly conducted," or admission of a scrawled
note, "Mary called," dated many months before the crime,
violates the defendant's basic constitutional right "to be
confronted with the witnesses against him." Yet one cannot
easily fit such evidence within a traditional hearsay exception. Nor can one fit it within this Court's special exception
for hearsay with " `particularized guarantees of trustworthiness' "; and, in any event, it is debatable whether the Sixth
Amendment principally protects "trustworthiness," rather
than "confrontation." See White, supra, at 363 (Thomas, J.,
concurring in part and concurring in judgment); cf. Maryland v. Craig, 497 U. S. 836, 862 (1990) (Scalia, J., dissenting) ("[T]he Confrontation Clause does not guarantee
reliable evidence; it guarantees specific trial procedures that
were thought to assure reliable evidence, undeniably among
which was `face-to-face' confrontation").

We need not reexamine the current connection between
the Confrontation Clause and the hearsay rule in this case,
however, because the statements at issue violate the Clause
regardless. See ante, at 139. I write separately to point
out that the fact that we do not reevaluate the link in this

case does not end the matter. It may leave the question
open for another day.

Justice Scalia, concurring in part and concurring in the
judgment.

During a custodial interrogation, Mark Lilly told police
officers that petitioner committed the charged murder. The
prosecution introduced a tape recording of these statements at trial without making Mark available for crossexamination. In my view, that is a paradigmatic Confrontation Clause violation. See White v. Illinois, 502 U. S. 346,
364-365 (1992) (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) ("The federal constitutional right of confrontation extends to any witness who actually testifies at
trial" and "extrajudicial statements only insofar as they are
contained in formalized testimonial materials, such as affidavits, depositions, prior testimony, or confessions"). Since
the violation is clear, the case need be remanded only for a
harmless-error determination. I therefore join Parts I, II,
and VI of the Court's opinion and concur in the judgment.

Justice Thomas, concurring in part and concurring in
the judgment.

I join Parts I and VI of the Court's opinion and concur in
the judgment. Though I continue to adhere to my view that
the Confrontation Clause "extends to any witness who actually testifies at trial" and "is implicated by extrajudicial
statements only insofar as they are contained in formalized
testimonial material, such as affidavits, depositions, prior
testimony, or confessions," White v. Illinois, 502 U. S. 346,
365 (1992) (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment), I agree with The Chief Justice that the Clause does
not impose a "blanket ban on the government's use of accomplice statements that incriminate a defendant," post, at 147.

144 LILLY v. VIRGINIA

Rehnquist, C. J., concurring in judgment
Such an approach not only departs from an original understanding of the Confrontation Clause but also freezes our
jurisprudence by making trial court decisions excluding such
statements virtually unreviewable. I also agree with The
Chief Justice that the lower courts did not "analyz[e] the
confession under the second prong of the Roberts inquiry,"
post, at 148, and therefore see no reason for the plurality to
address an issue upon which those courts did not pass.

Chief Justice Rehnquist, with whom Justice O'Connor and Justice Kennedy join, concurring in the

judgment.

The plurality today concludes that all accomplice confessions that inculpate a criminal defendant are not within a
firmly rooted exception to the hearsay rule under Ohio v.
Roberts, 448 U. S. 56 (1980). See ante, at 134. It also concludes that appellate courts should independently review the
government's proffered guarantees of trustworthiness under
the second half of the Roberts inquiry. See ante, at 137. I
disagree with both of these conclusions, but concur in the
judgment reversing the decision of the Supreme Court of
Virginia.

I

The plurality correctly states the issue in this case in the
opening sentence of its opinion: Whether petitioner's Confrontation Clause rights were violated by admission of an
accomplice's confession "that contained some statements
against the accomplice's penal interest and others that inculpated the accused." Ante, at 120. The confession of the accomplice, Mark Lilly, covers 50 pages in the Joint Appendix,
and the interviews themselves lasted about an hour. The
statements of Mark Lilly which are against his penal interest--and would probably show him as an aider and abettor--
are quite separate in time and place from other statements

Rehnquist, C. J., concurring in judgment
exculpating Mark and incriminating his brother, petitionerBenjamin Lilly, in the murder of Alexander DeFilippis.

1

Thus one is at a loss to know why so much of the plurality'sopinion is devoted to whether a declaration against penal interest is a "firmly rooted exception" to the hearsay ruleunder

Ohio v. Roberts, supra. Certainly, we must acceptthe Virginia court's determination that Mark's statements as

a whole were declarations against penal interest for purposesof the Commonwealth's hearsay rule. See ante, at 125.
Simply labeling a confession a "declaration against penal in-terest," however, is insufficient for purposes of Roberts, as
this exception "defines too large a class for meaningful Con-frontation Clause analysis."

Lee v. Illinois, 476 U. S. 530,544, n. 5 (1986). The plurality tries its hand at systematizing this class, see ante, at 127, but most of its housecleaningis unwarranted and results in a complete ban on the government's use of accomplice confessions that inculpate a co-defendant. Such a categorical holding has no place in this
case because the relevant portions of Mark Lilly's confessionwere simply not "declarations against penal interest" as that
term is understood in the law of evidence. There may beclose cases where the declaration against penal interest portion is closely tied in with the portion incriminating the de1 Mark identifies Ben as the one who murdered Alexander DeFilippis in
the following colloquy:
"M. L. I don't know, you know, dude shoots him.
"G. P. When you say `dude shoots him' which one are you calling a dude
here?

"M. L. Well, Ben shoots him.
"G. P. Talking about your brother, what did he shoot him with?
"M. L. Pistol.
"G. P. How many times did he shoot him?
"M. L. I heard a couple of shots go off, I don't know how many times he
hit him." App. 258.

A similar colloquy occurred in the second interview. See id., at 312-313.

fendant, see 2 J. Strong, McCormick on Evidence $ 319 (4thed. 1992), but this is not one of them. Mark Lilly's statements inculpating his brother in the murder of DeFilippisare not in the least against Mark's penal interest.

This case therefore does not raise the question whether
the Confrontation Clause permits the admission of a genu-inely self-inculpatory statement that also inculpates a codefendant, and our precedent does not compel the broadholding suggested by the plurality today. Cf.

Williamson
v. United States, 512 U. S. 594, 618-619 (1994) (Kennedy, J.,concurring) (explaining and providing examples of selfserving and more neutral declarations against penal inter-est). Indeed, several Courts of Appeals have admitted custodial confessions that equally inculpate both the declarant
and the defendant,2 and I see no reason for us to precludeconsideration of these or similar statements as satisfying a

firmly rooted hearsay exception under Roberts.

Not only were the incriminating portions of Mark Lilly's
confession not a declaration against penal interest, but these
statements were part of a custodial confession of the sort
that this Court has viewed with "special suspicion" given a
codefendant's " `strong motivation to implicate the defendant
and to exonerate himself.' " Lee, supra, at 541 (citations
omitted). Each of the cases cited by the plurality to support
its broad conclusion involved accusatory statements taken by
law enforcement personnel with a view to prosecution. See
Douglas v. Alabama, 380 U. S. 415, 416-417 (1965); Lee,
supra, at 532-536; cf. Bruton v. United States, 391 U. S. 123,
124-125 (1968); Williamson, supra, at 596-597. These cases

2 See, e. g., United States v. Keltner, 147 F. 3d 662, 670 (CA8 1998) (statement "clearly subjected" declarant to criminal liability for "activity in
which [he] participated and was planning to participate with . . . both
defendants"); Earnest v. Dorsey, 87 F. 3d 1123, 1134 (CA10 1996) ("entire
statement inculpated both [defendant] and [declarant] equally" and "neither [attempted] to shift blame to his co-conspirators nor to curry favor
from the police or prosecutor").

Rehnquist, C. J., concurring in judgment
did not turn solely on the fact that the challenged statementinculpated the defendant, but were instead grounded in the

Court's suspicion of untested custodial confessions. See,
e. g., Lee, supra, at 544-545. The plurality describes Dutton
v. Evans, 400 U. S. 74 (1970), as an "exception" to this line of
cases, ante, at 132, n. 2, but that case involved an accomplice'sstatement to a fellow prisoner, see 400 U. S., at 77-78, not a

custodial confession.The Court in

Dutton held that the admission of an accomplice's statement to a fellow inmate did not violate theConfrontation Clause under the facts of that case, see

id., at
86-89, and I see no reason to foreclose the possibility thatsuch statements, even those that inculpate a codefendant,

may fall under a firmly rooted hearsay exception. The
Court in Dutton recognized that statements to fellow prison-ers, like confessions to family members or friends, bear sufficient indicia of reliability to be placed before a jury without
confrontation of the declarant. Id., at 89. Several federal
courts have similarly concluded that such statements fall
under a firmly rooted hearsay exception.3 Dutton is thus

no "exception," but a case wholly outside the "unbroken line"
of cases, see ante, at 132, n. 2, in which custodial confessions
laying blame on a codefendant have been found to violate the
Confrontation Clause. The custodial confession in this case
falls under the coverage of this latter set of cases, and I
would not extend the holding here any further.

The plurality's blanket ban on the government's use of
accomplice statements that incriminate a defendant thus
sweeps beyond the facts of this case and our precedent,

3 See, e. g., United States v. York, 933 F. 2d 1343, 1362-1364 (CA7 1991)
(finding federal declaration against penal interest exception firmly rooted
in case involving accomplice's statements made to two associates); United
States v. Seeley, 892 F. 2d 1, 2 (CA1 1989) (exception firmly rooted in case
involving statements made to declarant's girlfriend and stepfather);
United States v. Katsougrakis, 715 F. 2d 769, 776 (CA2 1983) (no violation
in admitting accomplice's statements to friend).

Rehnquist, C. J., concurring in judgment
ignoring both the exculpatory nature of Mark's confessionand the circumstances in which it was given. Unlike the

plurality, I would limit our holding here to the case at hand,and decide only that Mark Lilly's custodial confession laying sole responsibility on petitioner cannot satisfy a firmlyrooted hearsay exception.

II
Nor do I see any reason to do more than reverse the deci-sion of the Supreme Court of Virginia and remand the case

for the Commonwealth to demonstrate that Mark's confes-sion bears "particularized guarantees of trustworthiness"
under Roberts, 448 U. S., at 66. The Supreme Court of Vir-ginia held only that Mark Lilly's confession was admissible
under a state-law exception to its hearsay rules and thenheld that this exception was firmly rooted for Confrontation
Clause purposes. See 255 Va. 558, 573-574, 499 S. E. 2d522, 533-534 (1998). Neither that court nor the trial court
analyzed the confession under the second prong of the Roberts inquiry, and the discussion of reliability cited by theCourt, see ante, at 122-123, 135, pertained only to whether

the confession should be admitted under state hearsay rules,not under the Confrontation Clause. Following our normal
course, I see no reason for this Court to reach an issue uponwhich the lower courts did not pass. See

National CollegeAthletic Assn. v. Smith, 525 U. S. 459, 470 (1999) ("[W]e do

not decide in the first instance issues not decided below").Thus, both this issue and the harmless-error question should
be sent back to the Virginia courts. See ante, at 139-140.The lack of any reviewable decision in this case makes especially troubling the plurality's conclusion that appellatecourts must independently review a lower court's determination that a hearsay statement bears particularized guar-antees of trustworthiness. Deciding whether a particular
statement bears the proper indicia of reliability under ourConfrontation Clause precedent "may be a mixed question of
fact and law," but the mix weighs heavily on the "fact" side.

Rehnquist, C. J., concurring in judgment
We have said that "deferential review of mixed questions oflaw and fact is warranted when it appears that the district

court is `better positioned' than the appellate court to decidethe issue in question or that probing appellate scrutiny will
not contribute to the clarity of legal doctrine." Salve Regina College v. Russell, 499 U. S. 225, 233 (1991) (citationomitted).

These factors counsel in favor of deference to trial judgeswho undertake the second prong of the Roberts inquiry.
They are better able to evaluate whether a particular state-ment given in a particular setting is sufficiently reliable that
cross-examination would add little to its trustworthiness.Admittedly, this inquiry does not require credibility determinations, but we have already held that deference to districtcourts does not depend on the need for credibility determinations. See Anderson v. Bessemer City, 470 U. S. 564, 574(1985).

Accordingly, I believe that in the setting here, as in Anderson, "[d]uplication of the trial judge's efforts in the court ofappeals would very likely contribute only negligibly to the

accuracy of fact determination at a huge cost in diversion ofjudicial resources." See

id., at 574-575. It is difficult toapply any standard in this case because none of the courts

below conducted the second part of the Roberts inquiry. Iwould therefore remand this case to the Supreme Court of
Virginia to carry out the inquiry, and, if any error is found,to determine whether that error is harmless.

DICKINSON, ACTING COMMISSIONER OF PATENTSAND TRADEMARKS

v. ZURKO et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe federal circuit

No. 98-377. Argued March 24, 1999--Decided June 10, 1999
In reviewing a Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) decision to deny respondents' patent application, the Federal Circuit analyzed the PTO's
factual finding using a "clearly erroneous" standard of review, which
generally governs appellate review of district court findings of fact
(court/court review), rather than the less stringent standards set forth
in the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), which permit a court to set
aside agency findings of fact found to be arbitrary, capricious, an abuse
of discretion, or unsupported by substantial evidence (court/agency review), 5 U. S. C. $ 706. The court found the PTO's factual finding to be
clearly erroneous.

Held: The Federal Circuit must use the framework set forth in $ 706 when

reviewing PTO findings of fact. Pp. 154-165.

(a) Absent an exception, a reviewing court must apply the APA's
court/agency review standards to agency factual findings. The Federal
Circuit bases such an exception on 5 U. S. C. $ 559, which provides that
the APA does "not limit or repeal additional requirements . . . recognized by law." In its view, at the time the APA was adopted in 1946,
the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals (CCPA), a Federal Circuit
predecessor, applied a court/court standard that was stricter than ordinary court/agency review standards, and this special tradition of strict
review amounted to an "additional requirement" that trumps $ 706's requirements. However, a close examination of the CCPA's cases reviewing PTO decisions do not reflect a well-established court/court standard.
The presence of the phrases "clear case of error," "clearly wrong," and
"manifest error" in those cases does not conclusively signal such review.
The relevant linguistic conventions were less firmly established before
the APA's adoption than they are today, with courts sometimes using
words such as "clearly erroneous" to describe less strict court/agency
review and words such as "substantial evidence" to describe stricter
court/court review. The absence of the words "substantial evidence" in
the CCPA's cases is not especially significant, since standardization of
that term began to take hold only after Congress started using it in
various federal statutes. Further, not one of the CCPA's opinions actually uses the words "clear error" or "clearly erroneous," which are terms

527US1 Unit: $U72 [05-01-01 21:27:17] PAGES PGT: OPIN

151Cite as: 527 U. S. 150 (1999)
Syllabus
of art signaling court/court review. Most of them use "manifest error,"
which is not now such a term of art. At the same time, this Court's
precedent undermines the claim that "clearly wrong" or "manifest
error" signal court/court review. Although the Court in Morgan v.
Daniels, 153 U. S. 120, used language that could be read as setting forth
a court/court standard, the Court's reasoning makes clear that it meant
its words to stand for a court/agency standard. The CCPA's cases reveal a similar pattern, using words such as "clearly wrong" and "manifest error" with explanations indicating that they had court/agency, not
court/court, review in mind. Pp. 154-161.

(b) Several policy reasons that the Federal Circuit believes militate
against using APA review standards--that a change will be disruptive
to the bench and bar; that the change will create an anomaly in which a
disappointed patent applicant who seeks review directly in the Federal
Circuit will be subject to court/agency review, while one who first seeks
review in a district court will have any further appeal reviewed under
a court/court standard; and that stricter review produces better agency
factfinding--are unconvincing. Pp. 161-165.

152 DICKINSON v. ZURKO

Opinion of the Court
Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court.
The Administrative Procedure Act (APA) sets forth standards governing judicial review of findings of fact made by
federal administrative agencies. 5 U. S. C. $ 706. We must
decide whether $ 706 applies when the Federal Circuit reviews findings of fact made by the Patent and Trademark
Office (PTO). We conclude that it does apply, and the Federal Circuit must use the framework set forth in that section.

I
Section 706, originally enacted in 1946, sets forth standards that govern the "Scope" of court "review" of, e. g.,
agency factfinding (what we shall call court/agency review).
It says that a

"reviewing court shall--. . . . .

"(2) hold unlawful and set aside agency . . . findings
. . . found to be--

"(A) arbitrary, capricious, [or] an abuse of discretion,
or . . .. . . . .

Opinion of the Court
"In making the foregoing determinations, the court shallreview the whole record or those parts of it cited by

a party . . . ."
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a) sets forth standardsthat govern appellate court review of findings of fact made

by a district court judge (what we shall call court/courtreview). It says that the appellate court shall set aside
those findings only if they are "clearly erroneous." Tra-ditionally, this court/court standard of review has been considered somewhat stricter (i. e., allowing somewhat closerjudicial review) than the APA's court/agency standards. 2
K. Davis & R. Pierce, Administrative Law Treatise $ 11.2,p. 174 (3d ed. 1994) (hereinafter Davis & Pierce).

The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit believes thatit should apply the "clearly erroneous" standard when it
reviews findings of fact made by the PTO. In re Zurko, 142F. 3d 1447, 1459 (1998) (case below). The Commissioner
of Patents, the PTO's head, believes to the contrary thatordinary APA court/agency standards apply. See,

e. g., Inre Kemps, 97 F. 3d 1427, 1430-1431 (CA Fed. 1996); In re

Napier, 55 F. 3d 610, 614 (CA Fed. 1995); In re Brana, 51F. 3d 1560, 1568-1569 (CA Fed. 1995).

The case before us tests these two competing legal views.Respondents applied for a patent upon a method for increasing computer security. The PTO patent examiner concludedthat respondents' method was obvious in light of prior art,
and so it denied the application. See 35 U. S. C. $ 103 (1994ed., Supp. III). The PTO's review board (the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences) upheld the examiner's deci-sion. Respondents sought review in the Federal Circuit,
where a panel treated the question of what the prior artteaches as one of fact, and agreed with respondents that the
PTO's factual finding was "clearly erroneous." In re Zurko,111 F. 3d 887, 889, and n. 2 (1997).

The Federal Circuit, hoping definitively to resolve thereview-standard controversy, then heard the matter en banc.

154 DICKINSON v. ZURKO

Opinion of the Court
After examining relevant precedents, the en banc court con-cluded that its use of the stricter court/court standard was

legally proper. The Solicitor General, representing theCommissioner of Patents, sought certiorari. We granted
the writ in order to decide whether the Federal Circuit'sreview of PTO factfinding must take place within the framework set forth in the APA.

II
The parties agree that the PTO is an "agency" subjectto the APA's constraints, that the PTO's finding at issue in

this case is one of fact, and that the finding constitutes"agency action." See 5 U. S. C. $ 701 (defining "agency" as
an "authority of the Government of the United States");$ 706 (applying APA "Scope of review" provisions to "agency
action"). Hence a reviewing court must apply the APA'scourt/agency review standards in the absence of an
exception.The Federal Circuit rests its claim for an exception upon

$ 559. That section says that the APA does "not limit orrepeal additional requirements . . . recognized by law." In
the Circuit's view: (1) at the time of the APA's adoption, in1946, the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals (CCPA), a
Federal Circuit predecessor, applied a court/court "clearlyerroneous" standard; (2) that standard was stricter than ordinary court/agency review standards; and (3) that specialtradition of strict review consequently amounted to an "additional requirement" that under $ 559 trumps the require-ments imposed by $ 706.

Recognizing the importance of maintaining a uniform ap-proach to judicial review of administrative action, see,

e. g.,Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, 340 U. S. 474, 489 (1951);

92 Cong. Rec. 5654 (1946) (statement of Rep. Walter),we have closely examined the Federal Circuit's claim for an
exception to that uniformity. In doing so, we believe thatrespondents must show more than a possibility of a height527US1 Unit: $U72 [05-01-01 21:27:17] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
ened standard, and indeed more than even a bare preponder-ance of evidence in their favor. Existence of the additional

requirement must be clear. This is suggested both by thephrase "recognized by law" and by the congressional specification in the APA that "[n]o subsequent legislation shall be
held to supersede or modify the provisions of this Act exceptto the extent that such legislation shall do so expressly."

$ 12, 60 Stat. 244, 5 U. S. C. $ 559. A statutory intent thatlegislative departure from the norm must be clear suggests
a need for similar clarity in respect to grandfatheredcommon-law variations. The APA was meant to bring uniformity to a field full of variation and diversity. It would
frustrate that purpose to permit divergence on the basis of
a requirement "recognized" only as ambiguous. In any
event, we have examined the 89 cases which, according to
respondents and supporting amici, embody the pre-APA
standard of review. See App. to Brief for New York Intellectual Property Law Association as Amicus Curiae 1a-6a
(collecting cases), and we conclude that those cases do not
reflect a well-established stricter court/court standard of judicial review for PTO factfinding, which circumstance fatally
undermines the Federal Circuit's conclusion.

The 89 pre-APA cases all involve CCPA review of a PTO
administrative decision, which either denied a patent or
awarded priority to one of several competing applicants.
See 35 U. S. C. $ 59a (1934 ed.) (granting CCPA review authority over PTO decisions); 35 U. S. C. $ 141 (current grant
of review authority to the Federal Circuit). The major consideration that favors the Federal Circuit's view consists of
the fact that 23 of the cases use words such as "clear case
of error" or "clearly wrong" to describe the CCPA's review
standard, while the remainder use words such as "manifest
error," which might be thought to mean the same thing.
See App. to Brief for New York Intellectual Property Law
Association as Amicus Curiae 1a-6a. When the CCPA decided many of these cases during the 1930's and early 1940's,

Opinion of the Court
legal authorities had begun with increasing regularity to usethe term "clearly erroneous" to signal court/court review,

Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 52(a) (adopted in 1937), and the term"substantial evidence" to signal less strict court/agency
review. Stern, Review of Findings of Administrators,
Judges and Juries: A Comparative Analysis, 58 Harv. L. Rev.70, 88 (1944) (describing congressional debates in which

members argued for and against applying the "clearly er-roneous" standard to agency review "precisely because
it would give administrative findings less finality than theyenjoyed under the `substantial evidence' rule").

Yet the presence of these phrases is not conclusive. The
relevant linguistic conventions were less firmly established
before adoption of the APA than they are today. At that
time courts sometimes used words such as "clearly erroneous" to describe less strict court/agency review standards.
See, e. g., Polish National Alliance v. NLRB, 136 F. 2d 175,
181 (CA7 1943); New York Trust Co. v. SEC, 131 F. 2d 274,
275 (CA2 1942), cert. denied, 318 U. S. 786 (1943); Hall v.
Commissioner, 128 F. 2d 180, 182 (CA7 1942); First National
Bank of Memphis v. Commissioner, 125 F. 2d 157 (CA6 1942)
(per curiam); NLRB v. Algoma Plywood & Veneer Co., 121
F. 2d 602, 606 (CA7 1941). Other times they used words
such as "substantial evidence" to describe stricter court/
court review (including appeals in patent infringement cases
challenging district court factfinding). See, e. g., Cornell v.
Chase Brass & Copper Co., 142 F. 2d 157, 160 (CA2 1944);
Dow Chemical Co. v. Halliburton Oil Well Cementing Co.,
139 F. 2d 473, 475 (CA6 1943), aff 'd, 324 U. S. 320 (1945);
Gordon Form Lathe Co. v. Ford Motor Co., 133 F. 2d 487,
496-497 (CA6), aff 'd, 320 U. S. 714 (1943); Electro Mfg. Co. v.
Yellin, 132 F. 2d 979, 981 (CA7 1943); Ajax Hand Brake Co.
v. Superior Hand Brake Co., 132 F. 2d 606, 609 (CA7 1943);
Galion Iron Works & Mfg. Co. v. Beckwith Machinery Co.,
105 F. 2d 941, 942 (CA3 1939). Indeed, this Court itself on
at least one occasion used the words "substantial evidence"

Opinion of the Court
to explain why it would not disturb a trial court's factualfindings.

Borden's Farm Products Co. v. Ten Eyck, 297
U. S. 251, 261 (1936); see also Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea
Co. v. Grosjean, 301 U. S. 412, 420 (1937) (accepting trial
court's findings of fact because they have "substantial support in the record").Nor is the absence of the words "substantial evidence"

in the CCPA's cases especially significant. Before theAPA, the use of that term to describe court/agency review
proceeded by fits and starts, with the standardization ofthe term beginning to take hold only after Congress began
using it (or the like) in various federal statutes. For example, this Court first used the phrase "substantial evidence"
in the agency context to describe its approach to the Interstate Commerce Commission's (ICC's) factual findings, ICC
v. Union Pacific R. Co., 222 U. S. 541, 548 (1912), even though
the underlying statute simply authorized a court of competent jurisdiction to suspend or set aside orders of the Commission, $ 12, 36 Stat. 551. The Court did not immediately
grant the Federal Trade Commission the same leeway it
granted the ICC, see FTC v. Curtis Publishing Co., 260 U. S.
568, 580 (1923), even though the underlying Act used language to which the phrase "substantial evidence" might have
applied, see $ 5, 38 Stat. 720 (the "findings of the commission
as to the facts, if supported by testimony, shall be conclusive"). As the words "substantial evidence" began to appear more often in statutes, the Court began to use those
same words in describing review standards, sometimes supplying the modifier "substantial" when Congress had left it
out. See, e. g., Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB, 305 U. S.
197, 229 (1938); see Stason, "Substantial Evidence" in Administrative Law, 89 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1026, 1026-1028 (1941) (collecting statutes); see also Dobson v. Commissioner, 320 U. S.
489, 499 (1943) (speaking generally of the "theoretical and
practical reason[s] for . . . [crediting] administrative decisions"). The patent statutes, however, did not and do not

use the term "substantial evidence" or any other term todescribe the standard of court review. 35 U. S. C. $$ 61, 62

(1934 ed.). Indeed, it apparently remains disputed to thisday (a dispute we need not settle today) precisely which APA
standard--"substantial evidence" or "arbitrary, capricious,
abuse of discretion"--would apply to court review of PTOfactfinding. See 5 U. S. C. $ 706(2)(E) (applying the term

"substantial evidence" where agency factfinding takes place"on the record"); see also

Association of Data Processing
Service Orgs., Inc. v. Board of Governors of Federal Reserve
System, 745 F. 2d 677, 683-684 (CADC 1984) (Scalia, J.)
(finding no difference between the APA's "arbitrary, capricious" standard and its "substantial evidence" standard as
applied to court review of agency factfinding.)

Further, not one of the 89 opinions actually uses the precise words "clear error" or "clearly erroneous," which are
terms of art signaling court/court review. Most of the 89
opinions use words like "manifest error," which is not now
such a term of art.

At the same time, precedent from this Court undermines
the Federal Circuit's claim that the phrases "clearly wrong "
or "manifest error" signal court/court review. The Federal
Circuit traced its standard of review back to Morgan v. Daniels, 153 U. S. 120 (1894), which it characterized as the foundation upon which the CCPA later built its review standards.
142 F. 3d, at 1453-1454. We shall describe that case in
some detail.

Morgan arose out of a Patent Office interference proceeding--a proceeding to determine which of two claimants was
the first inventor. The Patent Office decided the factual
question of "priority" in favor of one claimant; the Circuit
Court, deciding the case "without any additional testimony,"
153 U. S., at 122, reversed the Patent Office's factual finding
and awarded the patent to the other claimant. This Court
in turn reversed the Circuit Court, thereby restoring the
Patent Office decision.

Opinion of the Court
"What," asked Justice Brewer for the Court, "is the rule
which should control the [reviewing] court in the determination of this case?" Ibid. Is it that the Patent Office decision "should stand unless the testimony shows beyond any
reasonable doubt that the plaintiff was the first inventor"?
Id., at 123. The Court then cited two cases standing for
such a "reasonable doubt" standard. Ibid. (citing Cantrell
v. Wallick, 117 U. S. 689, 695 (1886), and Coffin v. Ogden, 18
Wall. 120, 124 (1874)). The Court found the two cases
"closely in point." 153 U. S., at 123. Justice Brewer wrote
that a person "challenging the priority awarded by the Patent Office . . . should . . . be held to as strict proof. " Ibid.
(emphasis added). The Court, pointing out that the Circuit
Court had used language "not quite so strong" (namely, "a
clear and undoubted preponderance of proof "), thought that
the Circuit Court's standard sounded more like the rule used
by "an appellate court in reviewing findings of fact made by
the trial court." Ibid. The Court then wrote:

"But this is something more than a mere appeal. It
is an application to the court to set aside the action of
one of the executive departments of the government.
. . . A new proceeding is instituted in the courts . . . to
set aside the conclusions reached by the administrative
department . . . . It is . . . not to be sustained by a
mere preponderance of evidence. . . . It is a controversy
between two individuals over a question of fact which
has once been settled by a special tribunal, entrusted
with full power in the premises. As such it might be
well argued, were it not for the terms of this statute,
that the decision of the patent office was a finality upon
every matter of fact." Id., at 124 (emphasis added).

The Court, in other words, reasoned strongly that a court/
court review standard is not proper; that standard is too
strict; a somewhat weaker standard of review is appropriate.

160 DICKINSON v. ZURKO

Opinion of the Court
We concede that the Court also used language that couldbe read as setting forth a court/court standard of review. It

said, for example, that the

"Patent Office [decision] must be accepted as controlling
upon that question of fact . . . unless the contrary isestablished by testimony which . . .

carries thorough
conviction. . . . [I]f doubtful, the decision of the PatentOffice must control."

Id., at 125 (emphasis added).

It added that the testimony was "not . . . sufficient to produce
a clear conviction that the Patent Office made a mistake."
Id., at 129 (emphasis added). But the Court did not use theemphasized words today; it used those words more than 100

years ago. And its reasoning makes clear that it meantthose words to stand for a court/agency review standard, a
standard weaker than the standard used by "an appellate
court in reviewing findings of fact made by the trial court."
Id., at 123.

The opinions in the 89 CCPA cases, cataloged in the Ap-pendix to this opinion, reveal the same pattern. They use

words such as "manifest error" or "clearly wrong." Butthey use those words to explain why they give so much, not
so little, deference to agency factfinding. And, their furtherexplanations, when given, indicate that they had court/
agency, not court/court, review in mind.

In nearly half of the cases, the CCPA explains why it usesits "manifest error" standard by pointing out that the PTO

is an expert body, or that the PTO can better deal with thetechnically complex subject matter, and that the PTO consequently deserves deference. In more than three-fourths
of the cases the CCPA says that it should defer to PTO factfinding because two (and sometimes more) PTO tribunals had
reviewed the matter and agreed about the factual finding.
These reasons are reasons that courts and commentators
have long invoked to justify deference to agency factfinding.
See Universal Camera, 340 U. S., at 496-497 (intraagency

U. S. 125, 145-146 (1939) (expertise); ICC v. Louisville &Nashville R. Co., 227 U. S. 88, 98 (1913) (expertise); Stern,
58 Harv. L. Rev., at 81-82 (expertise); 2 Davis & Pierce $ 11.2,at 178-181 (intraagency agreement). They are not the reasons courts typically have given for deferring to factfindingmade by a lower court judge. See,

e. g., Concrete Pipe &Products of Cal., Inc. v. Construction Laborers Pension

Trust for Southern Cal., 508 U. S. 602, 623 (1993); Stern,supra, at 82-83 (trial court advantages lie in, e. g., evaluation
of witness, not comparative expertise). And we think it alsoworth noting, in light of the pre-APA movement toward
standardization discussed above, supra, at 157, that theCCPA began to refer more frequently to technical complexity and agency expertise as time marched closer to 1946.Out of the 45 cases in our sample decided between 1929 and
1936, 40% (18 of 45) specifically referred to technical com-plexity. That percentage increased to 57% (25 of 44) for the
years 1937 to 1946.Given the CCPA's explanations, the review standard's
origins, and the nondeterminative nature of the phrases, wecannot agree with the Federal Circuit that in 1946, when
Congress enacted the APA, the CCPA "recognized" the useof a stricter court/court, rather than a less strict court/
agency, review standard for PTO decisions. Hence the Fed-eral Circuit's review of PTO findings of fact cannot amount
to an "additional requiremen[t] . . . recognized by law." 5U. S. C. $ 559.

III
The Federal Circuit also advanced several policy rea-sons which in its view militate against use of APA standards

of review. First, it says that both bench and bar have nowbecome used to the Circuit's application of a "clearly erroneous" standard that implies somewhat stricter court/courtreview. It says that change may prove needlessly disrup527US1 Unit: $U72 [05-01-01 21:27:17] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
tive. 142 F. 3d, at 1457-1458. Supporting amici add thatit is better that the matter remain " `settled than that it be

settled right.' " Brief for Patent, Trademark & CopyrightSection of the Bar Association of the District of Columbia as
Amicus Curiae 23 (quoting Square D Co. v. Niagara Frontier Tariff Bureau, Inc., 476 U. S. 409, 424 (1986)).This Court, however, has not previously settled the matter. The Federal Circuit's standard would require us to cre-ate $ 559 precedent that itself could prove disruptive by too
readily permitting other agencies to depart from uniformAPA requirements. And in any event we believe the Circuit
overstates the difference that a change of standard will mean
in practice.

This Court has described the APA court/agency "substantial evidence" standard as requiring a court to ask whether
a "reasonable mind might accept" a particular evidentiary
record as "adequate to support a conclusion." Consolidated
Edison, 305 U. S., at 229. It has described the court/court
"clearly erroneous" standard in terms of whether a reviewing judge has a "definite and firm conviction" that an
error has been committed. United States v. United States
Gypsum Co., 333 U. S. 364, 395 (1948). And it has suggested
that the former is somewhat less strict than the latter. Universal Camera, 340 U. S., at 477, 488 (analogizing "substantial evidence" test to review of jury findings and stating that appellate courts must respect agency expertise).
At the same time the Court has stressed the importance of
not simply rubber-stamping agency factfinding. Id., at 490.
The APA requires meaningful review; and its enactment
meant stricter judicial review of agency factfinding than
Congress believed some courts had previously conducted.
Ibid.

The upshot in terms of judicial review is some practical
difference in outcome depending upon which standard is
used. The court/agency standard, as we have said, is somewhat less strict than the court/court standard. But the dif527US1 Unit: $U72 [05-01-01 21:27:17] PAGES PGT: OPIN

163Cite as: 527 U. S. 150 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
ference is a subtle one--so fine that (apart from the present
case) we have failed to uncover a single instance in which
a reviewing court conceded that use of one standard rather
than the other would in fact have produced a different outcome. Cf. International Brotherhood of Electrical
Workers v. NLRB, 448 F. 2d 1127, 1142 (CADC 1971) (Leventhal, J., dissenting) (wrongly believing--and correcting himself--that he had found the "case dreamed of by law school
professors" where the agency's findings, though "clearly
erroneous," were "nevertheless" supported by "substantial
evidence").

The difficulty of finding such a case may in part reflect the
basic similarity of the reviewing task, which requires judges
to apply logic and experience to an evidentiary record,
whether that record was made in a court or by an agency.
It may in part reflect the difficulty of attempting to capture
in a form of words intangible factors such as judicial confidence in the fairness of the factfinding process. Universal
Camera, supra, at 489; Jaffe, Judicial Review: "Substantial
Evidence on the Whole Record," 64 Harv. L. Rev. 1233, 1245
(1951). It may in part reflect the comparatively greater importance of case-specific factors, such as a finding's dependence upon agency expertise or the presence of internal
agency review, which factors will often prove more influential in respect to outcome than will the applicable standard
of review.

These features of review underline the importance of the
fact that, when a Federal Circuit judge reviews PTO factfinding, he or she often will examine that finding through the
lens of patent-related experience--and properly so, for the
Federal Circuit is a specialized court. That comparative expertise, by enabling the Circuit better to understand the
basis for the PTO's finding of fact, may play a more important role in assuring proper review than would a theoretically somewhat stricter standard.

164 DICKINSON v. ZURKO

Opinion of the Court
Moreover, if the Circuit means to suggest that a changeof standard could somehow immunize the PTO's fact-related

"reasoning" from review, 142 F. 3d, at 1449-1450, we dis-agree. A reviewing court reviews an agency's reasoning

to determine whether it is "arbitrary" or "capricious," or,
if bound up with a record-based factual conclusion, to deter-mine whether it is supported by "substantial evidence."

E. g., SEC v. Chenery Corp., 318 U. S. 80, 89-93 (1943).Second, the Circuit and its supporting

amici believe that
a change to APA review standards will create an anomaly.An applicant denied a patent can seek review either directly

in the Federal Circuit, see 35 U. S. C. $ 141, or indirectly by
first obtaining direct review in federal district court, see

$ 145. The first path will now bring about Federal Circuit
court/agency review; the second path might well lead to Federal Circuit court/court review, for the Circuit now reviews
federal district court factfinding using a "clearly erroneous"
standard. Gould v. Quigg, 822 F. 2d 1074, 1077 (1987). The
result, the Circuit claims, is that the outcome may turn upon
which path a disappointed applicant takes; and it fears that
those applicants will often take the more complicated, timeconsuming indirect path in order to obtain stricter judicial
review of the PTO's determination.

We are not convinced, however, that the presence of the
two paths creates a significant anomaly. The second path
permits the disappointed applicant to present to the court
evidence that the applicant did not present to the PTO.
Ibid. The presence of such new or different evidence makes
a factfinder of the district judge. And nonexpert judicial
factfinding calls for the court/court standard of review. We
concede that an anomaly might exist insofar as the district
judge does no more than review PTO factfinding, but nothing
in this opinion prevents the Federal Circuit from adjusting
related review standards where necessary. Cf. Fregeau v.
Mossinghoff, 776 F. 2d 1034, 1038 (CA Fed. 1985) (harmonizing review standards).

165Cite as: 527 U. S. 150 (1999)
Appendix to opinion of the Court
Finally, the Circuit reasons that its stricter court/court re-view will produce better agency factfinding. It says that

the standard encourages the creation of "administrative rec-ords that more fully describe the metes and bounds of the
patent grant" and "help avoid situations where board fact
finding on matters such as anticipation or the factual inquir-ies underlying obviousness become virtually unreviewable."

142 F. 3d, at 1458. Neither the Circuit nor its supporting
amici, however, have explained convincingly why direct review of the PTO's patent denials demands a stricter fact-related review standard than is applicable to other agencies.

Congress has set forth the appropriate standard in the APA.For the reasons stated, we have not found circumstances that
justify an exception.

For these reasons, the judgment of the Federal Circuitis reversed. We remand the case for further proceedings

consistent with this opinion.

So ordered.

Chief Justice Rehnquist, with whom Justice Kennedy and Justice Ginsburg join, dissenting.

The issue in this case is whether, at the time of the enact-ment of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA or Act) over

50 years ago, judicial review of factfinding by the Patent andTrademark Office (PTO) under the "clearly erroneous" standard was an "additional requiremen[t] . . . recognized by law."5 U. S. C. $ 559. It is undisputed that, until today's decision,

527US1 Unit: $U72 [05-01-01 21:27:17] PAGES PGT: OPIN

171Cite as: 527 U. S. 150 (1999)
Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
both the patent bench and the patent bar had concluded thatthe stricter "clearly erroneous" standard was indeed such a

requirement placed upon the PTO.* Agency factfinding wasthus reviewed under this stricter standard; in my view, properly so, since the APA by its plain text was intended to bringsome uniformity to judicial review of agencies by

raising theminimum standards of review and not by lowering those

standards which existed at the time. Section 12 of the APA,which was ultimately codified as $ 559, provided that "[n]othing in this Act shall be held to diminish the constitutionalrights of any person or to limit or repeal additional requirements imposed by statute or otherwise recognized by law."Pub. L. 404, 79th Cong., 60 Stat. 244. As a result, we must
decide whether the "clearly erroneous" standard was indeedotherwise recognized by law in 1946.

This case therefore turns on whether the 89 or so casesidentified by the Court can be read as establishing a requirement placed upon agencies that was more demanding thanthe uniform minimum standards created by the APA. In
making this determination, I would defer, not to agencies ingeneral as the Court does today, but to the Court of Appeals
for the Federal Circuit, the specialized Article III courtcharged with review of patent appeals. In this case the
unanimous en banc Federal Circuit and the patent bar bothagree that these cases recognized the "clearly erroneous"
standard as an "additional requirement" placed on the PTObeyond the APA's minimum procedures. I see no reason to
reject their sensible and plausible resolution of the issue.Nor do I agree with the Court,

ante, at 154-155, thateither the plain language of $ 559 or the original $ 12 impose

any sort of "clear statement rule" on the common law. Sec*It appears that even the PTO acquiesced in this interpretation for almost 50 years after the enactment of the APA. See Brief for Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America as Amicus Curiae 7, and
n. 13 (the PTO first argued for the applicability of the APA's standards of
review to its patentability factfinding before the Federal Circuit in 1995).

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
tion 12 of the APA expressly stated that requirements whichpredated the APA and were "otherwise recognized by law"

were unaffected by the Act. If Congress had meant "other-wise recognized by law" to mean "clearly recognized by law,"
it certainly could have said so, but did not. I also reject thenotion that $ 559's separate

textual requirement that subse-quent statutes superseding or modifying the APA must do

so "expressly," 5 U. S. C. $ 559, should be read to impose anontextual clear statement rule for the antecedent commonlaw requirements that the APA supplemented. There is notension whatsoever between the goals of preserving more
rigorous common-law requirements at the time of enactmentand ensuring that future statutes would not repeal by implication the APA's uniform supplementary procedures.I therefore dissent for the reasons given by the Court of
Appeals.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fifth circuit

No. 98-387. Argued April 27, 1999--Decided June 14, 1999
Title 18 U. S. C. $ 1304 and an implementing Federal Communications

Commission (FCC) regulation prohibit, inter alia, radio and television
broadcasters from carrying advertising about privately operated commercial casino gambling, regardless of the station's or casino's location.
In United States v. Edge Broadcasting Co., 509 U. S. 418, this Court
upheld the constitutionality of $ 1304 as applied to advertising of Virginia's lottery by a broadcaster in North Carolina, where no such lottery
was authorized. Petitioners--representing New Orleans area broadcasters--wish to run advertisements for private commercial casinos
that are lawful and regulated in Louisiana and Mississippi, and they
filed this suit for a declaration that $ 1304 and the FCC's regulation
violate the First Amendment as applied to them. The District Court
utilized the test for assessing commercial speech restrictions set out
in Central Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y.,
447 U. S. 557, 566, and granted the Government's cross-motion for summary judgment. The Court of Appeals affirmed.

Held: Section 1304 may not be applied to advertisements of lawful private casino gambling that are broadcast by petitioners' radio or television stations located in Louisiana, where such gambling is legal.
Pp. 183-196.

(a) Central Hudson's four-part test asks (1) whether the speech at
issue concerns lawful activity and is not misleading and (2) whether the
asserted governmental interest is substantial; and, if so, (3) whether
the regulation directly advances the governmental interest asserted
and (4) whether it is not more extensive than is necessary to serve that
interest. The four parts of the Central Hudson test are not entirely
discrete; all are important and, to a certain extent, interrelated. While
some advocate a more straightforward and stringent test, Central Hudson, as applied in the Court's more recent commercial speech cases,
provides an adequate basis for decision in this case. Pp. 183-184.

(b) All parties agree that petitioners' proposed broadcasts constitute
commercial speech, and that they would satisfy the first part of the
Central Hudson test: Their content is not misleading and concerns lawful activities, i. e., private casino gambling in Louisiana and Mississippi.

v. UNITED STATES

Syllabus

In addition, the interests asserted by the Government are "substantial":
(1) reducing the social costs associated with casino and other forms of
gambling and (2) assisting States that restrict or prohibit casino and
other forms of gambling. However, that conclusion is by no means selfevident, since, in the judgment of both Congress and many state legislatures, the social costs that support the suppression of gambling are
offset, and sometimes outweighed, by countervailing policy considerations. The Court cannot ignore Congress' unwillingness to adopt a
single national policy that consistently endorses either interest asserted
by the Government. See, e. g., Edenfield v. Fane, 507 U. S. 761, 768.
Considering both the quality of the asserted interests and the information sought to be suppressed, the crosscurrents in the scope and
application of $ 1304 become more difficult to defend. Pp. 184-187.

(c) As applied to petitioners' case, $ 1304 cannot satisfy the third and
fourth parts of the Central Hudson test. With regard to the Government's first asserted interest--alleviating casino gambling's social costs
by limiting demand--the operation of $ 1304 and its regulatory regime
is so pierced by exemptions and inconsistencies that the Government
cannot hope to exonerate it. See Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co., 514 U. S.
476, 488. For example, federal law prohibits a broadcaster from carrying advertising about privately operated commercial casino gambling
regardless of the station's or casino's location, but exempts advertising about state-run casinos, certain occasional commercial casino gambling, and tribal casino gambling even if the broadcaster is located in, or
broadcasts to, a jurisdiction with the strictest of antigambling policies.
Coupled with the FCC's interpretation and enforcement of the statute, it appears that the Government is committed to prohibiting certain accurate product information, not commercial enticements of all
kinds, and then only for certain brands of casino gambling. The most
significant difference identified by the Government between tribal and
other classes of casino gambling is that the former are heavily regulated; but Congress' failure to institute such direct regulation of private casino gambling undermines the asserted justifications for the
speech restriction before the Court. There may be valid reasons for
imposing commercial regulations on non-Indian businesses that differ
from those imposed on tribal enterprises, but it does not follow that
those differences justify abridging non-Indians' freedom of speech more
severely than the freedom of their tribal competitors. For the power
to prohibit or to regulate particular conduct does not necessarily include
the power to prohibit or regulate speech about that conduct. To the
extent that federal law distinguishes among information about tribal,
governmental, and private casinos based on the identity of their owners or operators, the Government presents no sound reason why such

Syllabus
lines bear any meaningful relationship to the Government's asserted
interest. Pp. 188-194.

(d) Considering the manner in which $ 1304 and its exceptions operate
and the scope of the speech proscribed, the Government's second asserted interest--"assisting" States with policies that disfavor private
casinos--provides no more convincing basis for upholding the regulation
than the first. Even assuming that the state policies on which the Federal Government seeks to embellish are more coherent and pressing
than their federal counterpart, $ 1304 sacrifices an intolerable amount
of truthful speech about lawful conduct when compared to the diverse
policies at stake and the social ills that one could reasonably hope such
a ban to eliminate. Pp. 194-195.

v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court

Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court.
Federal law prohibits some, but by no means all, broadcastadvertising of lotteries and casino gambling. In

UnitedStates v. Edge Broadcasting Co., 509 U. S. 418 (1993), we

upheld the constitutionality of 18 U. S. C. $ 1304 as appliedto broadcast advertising of Virginia's lottery by a radio
station located in North Carolina, where no such lotterywas authorized. Today we hold that $ 1304 may not be applied to advertisements of private casino gambling that arebroadcast by radio or television stations located in Louisiana,
where such gambling is legal.

I
Through most of the 19th and the first half of the 20thcenturies, Congress adhered to a policy that not only discouraged the operation of lotteries and similar schemes, butforbade the dissemination of information concerning such
enterprises by use of the mails, even when the lottery inquestion was chartered by a state legislature.

1 Consistent

with this Court's earlier view that commercial advertisingwas unprotected by the First Amendment, see

Valentinev. Chrestensen, 316 U. S. 52, 54 (1942), we found that the

notion that "lotteries . . . are supposed to have a demor-alizing influence upon the people" provided sufficient justification for excluding circulars concerning such enterprisesfrom the federal postal system, Ex parte Jackson, 96 U. S.

1 See, e. g., Act of Mar. 2, 1895, 28 Stat. 963 (prohibiting the transportation in interstate or foreign commerce, and the mailing of, tickets and
advertisements for lotteries and similar enterprises); Act of Mar. 2, 1827,

$ 6, 4 Stat. 238 (restricting the participation of postmasters and assistant
postmasters in the lottery business); Act of July 27, 1868, $ 13, 15 Stat. 196
(prohibiting the mailing of any letters or circulars concerning lotteries or
similar enterprises); Act of July 12, 1876, $ 2, 19 Stat. 90 (repealing an
1872 limitation of the mails prohibition to letters and circulars concerning
"illegal" lotteries); Anti-Lottery Act of 1890, $ 1, 26 Stat. 465 (extending
the mails prohibition to newspapers containing advertisements or prize
lists for lotteries or gift enterprises).

Opinion of the Court
727, 736-737 (1878). We likewise deferred to congressional
judgment in upholding the similar exclusion for newspapers
that contained either lottery advertisements or prize lists.
In re Rapier, 143 U. S. 110, 134-135 (1892); see generally
Edge, 509 U. S., at 421-422; Lottery Case, 188 U. S. 321
(1903). The current versions of these early antilottery statutes are now codified at 18 U. S. C. $$ 1301-1303.

Congress extended its restrictions on lottery-related information to broadcasting as communications technology made
that practice both possible and profitable. It enacted the
statute at issue in this case as $ 316 of the Communications
Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 1088. Now codified at 18 U. S. C. $ 1304
("Broadcasting lottery information"), the statute prohibits
radio and television broadcasting, by any station for which a
license is required, of

"any advertisement of or information concerning any
lottery, gift enterprise, or similar scheme, offering
prizes dependent in whole or in part upon lot or chance,
or any list of the prizes drawn or awarded by means of
any such lottery, gift enterprise, or scheme, whether
said list contains any part or all of such prizes."

The statute provides that each day's prohibited broadcasting
constitutes a separate offense punishable by a fine, imprisonment for not more than one year, or both. Ibid. Although

$ 1304 is a criminal statute, the Solicitor General informs us
that, in practice, the provision traditionally has been enforced by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC),
which imposes administrative sanctions on radio and television licensees for violations of the agency's implementing regulation. See 47 CFR $ 73.1211 (1998); Brief for Respondents 3. Petitioners now concede that the broadcast
ban in $ 1304 and the FCC's regulation encompasses advertising for privately owned casinos--a concession supported
by the broad language of the statute, our precedent, and the

Opinion of the Court

FCC's sound interpretation. See FCC v. American Broadcasting Co., 347 U. S. 284, 290-291, and n. 8 (1954).

During the second half of this century, Congress dra-matically narrowed the scope of the broadcast prohibition

in $ 1304. The first inroad was minor: In 1950, certain notfor-profit fishing contests were exempted as "innocent pas-times . . . far removed from the reprehensible type of gambling activity which it was paramount in the congressionalmind to forbid." S. Rep. No. 2243, 81st Cong., 2d Sess., 2
(1950); see Act of Aug. 16, 1950, ch. 722, 64 Stat. 451, 18U. S. C. $ 1305.

Subsequent exemptions were more substantial. Responding to the growing popularity of state-run lotteries, in 1975
Congress enacted the provision that gave rise to our decision in Edge. 509 U. S., at 422-423; Act of Jan. 2, 1975, 88
Stat. 1916, 18 U. S. C. $ 1307; see also $ 1953(b)(4). With
subsequent modifications, that amendment now exempts advertisements of state-conducted lotteries from the nationwide postal restrictions in $$ 1301 and 1302, and from the
broadcast restriction in $ 1304, when "broadcast by a radio
or television station licensed to a location in . . . a State
which conducts such a lottery." $ 1307(a)(1)(B); see also

$$ 1307(a)(1)(A), (b)(1). The $ 1304 broadcast restriction remained in place, however, for stations licensed in States that
do not conduct lotteries. In Edge, we held that this remaining restriction on broadcasts from nonlottery States, such
as North Carolina, supported the "laws against gambling" in
those jurisdictions and properly advanced the "congressional
policy of balancing the interests of lottery and nonlottery
States." 509 U. S., at 428.

In 1988, Congress enacted two additional statutes that
significantly curtailed the coverage of $ 1304. First, the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA), 102 Stat. 2467, 25
U. S. C. $ 2701 et seq., authorized Native American tribes to
conduct various forms of gambling--including casino gambling--pursuant to tribal-state compacts if the State permits

179Cite as: 527 U. S. 173 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
such gambling "for any purpose by any person, organization,or entity." $ 2710(d)(1)(B). The IGRA also exempted "any

gaming conducted by an Indian tribe pursuant to" the Actfrom both the postal and transportation restrictions in 18
U. S. C. $$ 1301-1302, and the broadcast restriction in $ 1304.
25 U. S. C. $ 2720. Second, the Charity Games AdvertisingClarification Act of 1988, 18 U. S. C. $ 1307(a)(2), extended the

exemption from $$ 1301-1304 for state-run lotteries to in-clude any other lottery, gift enterprise, or similar scheme--
not prohibited by the law of the State in which it oper-ates--when conducted by: (i) any governmental organization;
(ii) any not-for-profit organization; or (iii) a commercial
organization as a promotional activity "clearly occasional
and ancillary to the primary business of that organization."
There is no dispute that the exemption in $ 1307(a)(2) applies
to casinos conducted by state and local governments. And,
unlike the 1975 broadcast exemption for advertisements of
and information concerning state-conducted lotteries, the
exemptions in both of these 1988 statutes are not geographically limited; they shield messages from $ 1304's reach
in States that do not authorize such gambling as well as
those that do.

A separate statute, the 1992 Professional and Amateur
Sports Protection Act, 28 U. S. C. $ 3701 et seq., proscribes
most sports betting and advertising thereof. Section 3702
makes it unlawful for a State or tribe "to sponsor, operate, advertise, promote, license, or authorize by law or
compact"--or for a person "to sponsor, operate, advertise,
or promote, pursuant to the law or compact" of a State or
tribe--any lottery or gambling scheme based directly or indirectly on competitive games in which amateur or professional athletes participate. However, the Act also includes
a variety of exemptions, some with obscured congressional
purposes: (i) gambling schemes conducted by States or other
governmental entities at any time between January 1, 1976,
and August 31, 1990; (ii) gambling schemes authorized by

statutes in effect on October 2, 1991; (iii) gambling "con-ducted exclusively in casinos" located in certain municipalities if the schemes were authorized within 1 year of the ef-fective date of the Act and, for "commercial casino gaming
scheme[s]," that had been in operation for the preceding 10
years pursuant to a state constitutional provision and com-prehensive state regulation applicable to that municipality;

and (iv) gambling on parimutuel animal racing or jai-alaigames. $ 3704(a); see also 18 U. S. C. $$ 1953(b)(1)-(3) (regarding interstate transportation of wagering parapher-nalia). These exemptions make the scope of $ 3702's advertising prohibition somewhat unclear, but the prohibitionis not limited to broadcast media and does not depend on
the location of a broadcast station or other disseminator of
promotional materials.

Thus, unlike the uniform federal antigambling policy that
prevailed in 1934 when 18 U. S. C. $ 1304 was enacted, federal statutes now accommodate both progambling and antigambling segments of the national polity.

in neighboring states including Texas and Arkansas," 3 Rec-ord 628, where private casino gambling is unlawful.

Petitioners brought this action against the United Statesand the FCC in the District Court for the Eastern District
of Louisiana, praying for a declaration that $ 1304 and theFCC's regulation violate the First Amendment as applied to
them, and for an injunction preventing enforcement of thestatute and the rule against them. After noting that all parties agreed that the case should be decided on their cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court ruled in
favor of the Government. 866 F. Supp. 975, 976 (1994). Thecourt applied the standard for assessing commercial speech
restrictions set out in Central Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp.v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U. S. 557, 566 (1980),
and concluded that the restrictions at issue adequately ad-vanced the Government's "substantial interest (1) in protecting the interest of nonlottery states and (2) in reduc-ing participation in gambling and thereby minimizing the
social costs associated therewith." 866 F. Supp., at 979.The court pointed out that federal law does not prohibit the
broadcast of all information about casinos, such as adver-tising that promotes a casino's amenities rather than its
"gaming aspects," and observed that advertising for state-authorized casinos in Louisiana and Mississippi was actually
"abundant." Id., at 980.A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth
Circuit agreed with the District Court's application of Cen-tral Hudson, and affirmed the grant of summary judgment
to the Government. 69 F. 3d 1296, 1298 (1995). The panelmajority's description of the asserted governmental interests, although more specific, was essentially the same as theDistrict Court's:

"First, section 1304 serves the interest of assistingstates that restrict gambling by regulating interstate
activities such as broadcasting that are beyond thepowers of the individual states to regulate. The sec527US1 Unit: $U73 [05-01-01 23:33:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court

ond asserted governmental interest lies in discourag-ing public participation in commercial gambling, thereby

minimizing the wide variety of social ills that have his-torically been associated with such activities." Id., at
1299.
The majority relied heavily on our decision in Posadas de
Puerto Rico Associates v. Tourism Co. of P. R., 478 U. S.328 (1986), see 69 F. 3d, at 1300-1302, and endorsed the

theory that, because gambling is in a category of "vice ac-tivity" that can be banned altogether, "advertising of gambling can lay no greater claim on constitutional protectionthan the underlying activity,"

id., at 1302. In dissent, ChiefJudge Politz contended that the many exceptions to the

original prohibition in $ 1304--and that section's conflict withthe policies of States that had legalized gambling--precluded
justification of the restriction by either an interest in sup-porting anticasino state policies or "an independent federal
interest in discouraging public participation in commercialgambling."

Id., at 1303-1304.While the broadcasters' petition for certiorari was pending in this Court, we decided 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. RhodeIsland, 517 U. S. 484 (1996). Because the opinions in that
case concluded that our precedent both preceding and fol-lowing

Posadas had applied the Central Hudson test morestrictly, 517 U. S., at 509-510 (opinion of S

tevens, J.); id., at531-532 (O'C
onnor, J., concurring in judgment)--and be-cause we had rejected the argument that the power to restrict speech about certain socially harmful activities was asbroad as the power to prohibit such conduct, see id., at 513-
514 (opinion of Stevens, J.); see also Rubin v. Coors Brewing
Co., 514 U. S. 476, 482-483, n. 2 (1995)--we granted thebroadcasters' petition, vacated the judgment of the Court of

Appeals, and remanded the case for further consideration.519 U. S. 801 (1996).

On remand, the Fifth Circuit majority adhered to its priorconclusion. 149 F. 3d 334 (1998). The majority recognized

Opinion of the Court
that at least part of the Central Hudson inquiry had "becomea tougher standard for the state to satisfy," 149 F. 3d, at

338, but held that $ 1304's restriction on speech sufficientlyadvanced the asserted governmental interests and was not
"broader than necessary to control participation in casinogambling,"

id., at 340. Because the Court of Appeals forthe Ninth Circuit reached a contrary conclusion in Valley

Broadcasting Co. v. United States, 107 F. 3d 1328, cert. de-nied, 522 U. S. 1115 (1998), as did a Federal District Court in
Players Int'l, Inc. v. United States, 988 F. Supp. 497 (NJ1997), we again granted the broadcasters' petition for certiorari. 525 U. S. 1097 (1999). We now reverse.

III
In a number of cases involving restrictions on speech thatis "commercial" in nature, we have employed

Central Hudson's four-part test to resolve First Amendment challenges:

"At the outset, we must determine whether the expres-sion is protected by the First Amendment. For commercial speech to come within that provision, it at leastmust concern lawful activity and not be misleading.
Next, we ask whether the asserted governmental in-terest is substantial. If both inquiries yield positive
answers, we must determine whether the regulationdirectly advances the governmental interest asserted,
and whether it is not more extensive than is necessaryto serve that interest." 447 U. S., at 566.

In this analysis, the Government bears the burden of iden-tifying a substantial interest and justifying the challenged
restriction. Edenfield v. Fane, 507 U. S. 761, 770 (1993);
Board of Trustees of State Univ. of N. Y. v. Fox, 492 U. S.469, 480 (1989);

Bolger v. Youngs Drug Products Corp., 463U. S. 60, 71, and n. 20 (1983).

The four parts of the Central Hudson test are not entirelydiscrete. All are important and, to a certain extent, inter527US1 Unit: $U73 [05-01-01 23:33:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN

to which may inform a judgment concerning the other three.Partly because of these intricacies, petitioners as well as
certain judges, scholars, and amici curiae have advocatedrepudiation of the

Central Hudson standard and imple-mentation of a more straightforward and stringent test for

assessing the validity of governmental restrictions on com-mercial speech.

3 As the opinions in 44 Liquormart demonstrate, reasonable judges may disagree about the meritsof such proposals. It is, however, an established part of

our constitutional jurisprudence that we do not ordinarilyreach out to make novel or unnecessarily broad pronouncements on constitutional issues when a case can be fully re-solved on a narrower ground. See

United States v. Raines,362 U. S. 17, 21 (1960). In this case, there is no need to

break new ground. Central Hudson, as applied in our morerecent commercial speech cases, provides an adequate basis
for decision. IV

nate accurate information as to the operation of market com-petitors, such as pay-out ratios, which can benefit listeners

by informing their consumption choices and fostering pricecompetition. Thus, even if the broadcasters' interest in conveying these messages is entirely pecuniary, the interests of,and benefit to, the audience may be broader. See

VirginiaBd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council,

Inc., 425 U. S. 748, 764-765 (1976); Linmark Associates, Inc.v. Willingboro, 431 U. S. 85, 96-97 (1977); Bigelow v. Virginia, 421 U. S. 809, 822 (1975).The second part of the Central Hudson test asks whether
the asserted governmental interest served by the speechrestriction is substantial. The Solicitor General identifies
two such interests: (1) reducing the social costs associatedwith "gambling" or "casino gambling," and (2) assisting
States that "restrict gambling" or "prohibit casino gam-bling" within their own borders.

4 Underlying Congress'

statutory scheme, the Solicitor General contends, is thejudgment that gambling contributes to corruption and organized crime; underwrites bribery, narcotics trafficking,and other illegal conduct; imposes a regressive tax on the
poor; and "offers a false but sometimes irresistible hopeof financial advancement." Brief for Respondents 15-16.
With respect to casino gambling, the Solicitor General statesthat many of the associated social costs stem from "pathological" or "compulsive" gambling by approximately 3 mil-lion Americans, whose behavior is primarily associated with
"continuous play" games, such as slot machines. He alsoobserves that compulsive gambling has grown along with
the expansion of legalized gambling nationwide, leading tobillions of dollars in economic costs; injury and loss to these

Government's argument and are more closely linked to the speech regulation at issue, thereby providing a more likely basis for upholding $ 1304
as applied to these broadcasters and their proposed messages.

16-20.We can accept the characterization of these two interests as "substantial," but that conclusion is by no meansself-evident. No one seriously doubts that the Federal Government may assert a legitimate and substantial interest inalleviating the societal ills recited above, or in assisting likeminded States to do the same. Cf. Edge, 509 U. S., at 428.But in the judgment of both the Congress and many state
legislatures, the social costs that support the suppressionof gambling are offset, and sometimes outweighed, by countervailing policy considerations, primarily in the form ofeconomic benefits.

social costs, Congress has not only sanctioned casino gam-bling for Indian tribes through tribal-state compacts, but has

enacted other statutes that reflect approval of state legisla-tion that authorizes a host of public and private gambling
activities. See, e. g., 18 U. S. C. $$ 1307, 1953(b); 25 U. S. C.$$ 2701-2702, 2710(d); 28 U. S. C. $ 3704(a). That Congress
has generally exempted state-run lotteries and casinos fromfederal gambling legislation reflects a decision to defer to,
and even promote, differing gambling policies in differentStates. Indeed, in

Edge we identified the federal interestfurthered by $ 1304's partial broadcast ban as the "congressional policy of balancing the interests of lottery and non-lottery States." 509 U. S., at 428. Whatever its character
in 1934 when $ 1304 was adopted, the federal policy of dis-couraging gambling in general, and casino gambling in particular, is now decidedly equivocal.Of course, it is not our function to weigh the policy arguments on either side of the nationwide debate over whetherand to what extent casino and other forms of gambling
should be legalized. Moreover, enacted congressional policyand "governmental interests" are not necessarily equivalents
for purposes of commercial speech analysis. See Bolger,463 U. S., at 70-71. But we cannot ignore Congress' unwillingness to adopt a single national policy that consistentlyendorses either interest asserted by the Solicitor General.

Opinion of the Court

V
The third part of the Central Hudson test asks whetherthe speech restriction directly and materially advances the

asserted governmental interest. "This burden is not sat-isfied by mere speculation or conjecture; rather, a governmental body seeking to sustain a restriction on commer-cial speech must demonstrate that the harms it recites are
real and that its restriction will in fact alleviate them to amaterial degree."

Edenfield, 507 U. S., at 770-771. Con-sequently, "the regulation may not be sustained if it provides only ineffective or remote support for the govern-ment's purpose."

Central Hudson, 447 U. S., at 564. Wehave observed that "this requirement is critical; otherwise,

`a State could with ease restrict commercial speech in theservice of other objectives that could not themselves justify
a burden on commercial expression.' " Rubin, 514 U. S., at487, quoting

Edenfield, 507 U. S., at 771.The fourth part of the test complements the directadvancement inquiry of the third, asking whether the speechrestriction is not more extensive than necessary to serve the
interests that support it. The Government is not requiredto employ the least restrictive means conceivable, but it must
demonstrate narrow tailoring of the challenged regulation tothe asserted interest--"a fit that is not necessarily perfect,
but reasonable; that represents not necessarily the singlebest disposition but one whose scope is in proportion to the
interest served." Fox, 492 U. S., at 480 (internal quotationmarks omitted); see

44 Liquormart, 517 U. S., at 529, 531(O'C
onnor, J., concurring in judgment). On the whole,then, the challenged regulation should indicate that its proponent " `carefully calculated' the costs and benefits associ-ated with the burden on speech imposed by its prohibition."
Cincinnati v. Discovery Network, Inc., 507 U. S. 410, 417(1993), quoting Fox, 492 U. S., at 480.

As applied to petitioners' case, $ 1304 cannot satisfy thesestandards. With regard to the first asserted interest--

189Cite as: 527 U. S. 173 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
alleviating the social costs of casino gambling by limitingdemand--the Government contends that its broadcasting

restrictions directly advance that interest because "promo-tional" broadcast advertising concerning casino gambling increases demand for such gambling, which in turn increasesthe amount of casino gambling that produces those social
costs. Additionally, the Government believes that compul-sive gamblers are especially susceptible to the pervasiveness
and potency of broadcast advertising. Brief for Respond-ents 33-36. Assuming the accuracy of this causal chain, it
does not necessarily follow that the Government's speech banhas directly and materially furthered the asserted interest.
While it is no doubt fair to assume that more advertisingwould have some impact on overall demand for gambling,
it is also reasonable to assume that much of that advertis-ing would merely channel gamblers to one casino rather
than another. More important, any measure of the effec-tiveness of the Government's attempt to minimize the social
costs of gambling cannot ignore Congress' simultaneous en-couragement of tribal casino gambling, which may well be
growing at a rate exceeding any increase in gambling orcompulsive gambling that private casino advertising could
produce. See n. 5, supra. And, as the Court of Appealsrecognized, the Government fails to "connect casino gambling and compulsive gambling with broadcast advertisingfor casinos"--let alone broadcast advertising for non-Indian
commercial casinos. 149 F. 3d, at 339.6

6 The Government cites several secondary sources and declarations that
it put before the Federal District Court in New Jersey and, as an alternative to affirming the judgment below, requests a remand so that it may
have another chance to build a record in the Fifth Circuit. Remand is
inappropriate for several reasons. First, the Government had ample opportunity to enter the materials it thought relevant after we vacated the
Fifth Circuit's first ruling and remanded for reconsideration in light of
44 Liquormart. Second, the Government's evidence did not convince the
New Jersey court that $ 1304 could be constitutionally applied in circumstances similar to this case, see Players Int'l, Inc. v. United States, 988

v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court

We need not resolve the question whether any lack of evidence in the record fails to satisfy the standard of proof
under Central Hudson, however, because the flaw in the
Government's case is more fundamental: The operation of

$ 1304 and its attendant regulatory regime is so pierced by
exemptions and inconsistencies that the Government cannot
hope to exonerate it. See Rubin, 514 U. S., at 488. Under
current law, a broadcaster may not carry advertising about
privately operated commercial casino gambling, regardless
of the location of the station or the casino. 18 U. S. C. $ 1304;
47 CFR $ 73.1211(a) (1998). On the other hand, advertisements for tribal casino gambling authorized by state compacts--whether operated by the tribe or by a private party
pursuant to a management contract--are subject to no such
broadcast ban, even if the broadcaster is located in, or broadcasts to, a jurisdiction with the strictest of antigambling policies. 25 U. S. C. $ 2720. Government-operated, nonprofit,
and "occasional and ancillary" commercial casinos are likewise exempt. 18 U. S. C. $ 1307(a)(2).

The FCC's interpretation and application of $$ 1304 and
1307 underscore the statute's infirmity. Attempting to enforce the underlying purposes and policy of the statute, the
FCC has permitted broadcasters to tempt viewers with
claims of "Vegas-style excitement" at a commercial "casino,"
if "casino" is part of the establishment's proper name and the
advertisement can be taken to refer to the casino's amenities,

F. Supp. 497, 502-503, 506-507 (1997), and most of the sources that the
Government cited in the New Jersey litigation were also presented to the
Fifth Circuit, see Supplemental Brief for Appellees in No. 94-30732 (CA5),
pp. iv-v. Indeed, the Government presented sources to the Fifth Circuit
not provided to the New Jersey court, and the Fifth Circuit relied on
material that the Government had not proffered. In any event, as we
shall explain, additional evidence to support the Government's factual assertions in this Court cannot justify the scheme of speech restrictions
currently in effect.

Opinion of the Court
rather than directly promote its gaming aspects.7 While wecan hardly fault the FCC in view of the statute's focus on

the suppression of certain types of information, the agency'spractice is squarely at odds with the governmental interests
asserted in this case.From what we can gather, the Government is committed
to prohibiting accurate product information, not commercialenticements of all kinds, and then only when conveyed over
certain forms of media and for certain types of gambling--indeed, for only certain brands of

casino gambling--and de-spite the fact that messages about the availability of such

gambling are being conveyed over the airwaves by other
speakers.Even putting aside the broadcast exemptions for arguably

distinguishable sorts of gambling that might also give riseto social costs about which the Federal Government is concerned--such as state lotteries and parimutuel betting onhorse and dog races, $ 1307(a)(1)(B); 28 U. S. C. $ 3704(a)--
the Government presents no convincing reason for peggingits speech ban to the identity of the owners or operators of
the advertised casinos. The Government cites revenue
needs of States and tribes that conduct casino gambling,and notes that net revenues generated by the tribal casinos

are dedicated to the welfare of the tribes and their members.See 25 U. S. C. $$ 2710(b)(2)(B), (d)(1)(A)(ii), (2)(A). Yet the
Government admits that tribal casinos offer precisely thesame types of gambling as private casinos. Further, the Solicitor General does not maintain that government-operatedcasino gaming is any different, that States cannot derive
revenue from taxing private casinos, or that any one class

Opinion of the Court

of casino operators is likely to advertise in a meaningfullydistinct manner from the others. The Government's suggestion that Indian casinos are too isolated to warrant at-tention is belied by a quick review of tribal geography and
the Government's own evidence regarding the financial success of tribal gaming. See n. 5, supra. If distance weredeterminative, Las Vegas might have remained a relatively

small community, or simply disappeared like a desert mirage.Ironically, the most significant difference identified by the
Government between tribal and other classes of casinogambling is that the former is "heavily regulated." Brief
for Respondents 38. If such direct regulation provides a
basis for believing that the social costs of gambling in tribal
casinos are sufficiently mitigated to make their advertising tolerable, one would have thought that Congress might
have at least experimented with comparable regulation before abridging the speech rights of federally unregulated
casinos. While Congress' failure to institute such direct
regulation of private casino gambling does not necessarily
compromise the constitutionality of $ 1304, it does undermine the asserted justifications for the restriction before us.
See Rubin, 514 U. S., at 490-491. There surely are practical and nonspeech-related forms of regulation--including a
prohibition or supervision of gambling on credit; limitations
on the use of cash machines on casino premises; controls on
admissions; pot or betting limits; location restrictions; and
licensing requirements--that could more directly and effectively alleviate some of the social costs of casino gambling.

We reached a similar conclusion in Rubin. There, we
considered the effect of conflicting federal policies on the
Government's claim that a speech restriction materially advanced its interest in preventing so-called "strength wars"
among competing sellers of certain alcoholic beverages.
We concluded that the effect of the challenged restriction
on commercial speech had to be evaluated in the context
of the entire regulatory scheme, rather than in isolation,

527US1 Unit: $U73 [05-01-01 23:33:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
and we invalidated the restriction based on the "overallirrationality of the Government's regulatory scheme."

Id.,
at 488. As in this case, there was "little chance" that thespeech restriction could have directly and materially advanced its aim, "while other provisions of the same Act
directly undermine[d] and counteract[ed] its effects." Id.,at 489. Coupled with the availability of other regulatory

options which could advance the asserted interests "in amanner less intrusive to [petitioners'] First Amendment
rights," we found that the Government could not satisfy the
Central Hudson test. Id., at 490-491.

Given the special federal interest in protecting the welfare of Native Americans, see California v. Cabazon Band
of Mission Indians, 480 U. S. 202, 216-217 (1987), we recognize that there may be valid reasons for imposing commercial
regulations on non-Indian businesses that differ from those
imposed on tribal enterprises. It does not follow, however,
that those differences also justify abridging non-Indians'
freedom of speech more severely than the freedom of their
tribal competitors. For the power to prohibit or to regulate
particular conduct does not necessarily include the power to
prohibit or regulate speech about that conduct. 44 Liquormart, 517 U. S., at 509-511 (opinion of Stevens, J.); see
id., at 531-532 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment);
Rubin, 514 U. S., at 483, n. 2. It is well settled that the
First Amendment mandates closer scrutiny of government
restrictions on speech than of its regulation of commerce
alone. Fox, 492 U. S., at 480. And to the extent that the
purpose and operation of federal law distinguishes among
information about tribal, governmental, and private casinos
based on the identity of their owners or operators, the Government presents no sound reason why such lines bear any
meaningful relationship to the particular interest asserted:
minimizing casino gambling and its social costs by way of a
(partial) broadcast ban. Discovery Network, 507 U. S., at
424, 428. Even under the degree of scrutiny that we have

Opinion of the Court

applied in commercial speech cases, decisions that selectamong speakers conveying virtually identical messages are

in serious tension with the principles undergirding the FirstAmendment. Cf. Carey v. Brown, 447 U. S. 455, 465 (1980);
First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765, 777, 784-785 (1978).

The second interest asserted by the Government--the de-rivative goal of "assisting" States with policies that disfavor
private casinos--adds little to its case. We cannot see howthis broadcast restraint, ambivalent as it is, might directly
and adequately further any state interest in dampening con-sumer demand for casino gambling if it cannot achieve the
same goal with respect to the similar federal interest.Furthermore, even assuming that the state policies on
which the Federal Government seeks to embellish are morecoherent and pressing than their federal counterpart, $ 1304
sacrifices an intolerable amount of truthful speech aboutlawful conduct when compared to all of the policies at stake
and the social ills that one could reasonably hope such aban to eliminate. The Government argues that petitioners'
speech about private casino gambling should be prohibitedin Louisiana because, "under appropriate conditions," 3 Record 628, citizens in neighboring States like Arkansas andTexas (which hosts tribal, but not private, commercial casino
gambling) might hear it and make rash or costly decisions.To be sure, in order to achieve a broader objective such
regulations may incidentally, even deliberately, restrict acertain amount of speech not thought to contribute significantly to the dangers with which the Government is con-cerned. See Fox, 492 U. S., at 480; cf. Edge, 509 U. S., at
429-430.8 But Congress' choice here was neither a rough

the restriction in nonlottery States, while not interfering with the policies
of lottery States like Virginia . . . . [W]e judge the validity of the restriction in this case by the relation it bears to the general problem of accom527US1 Unit: $U73 [05-01-01 23:33:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
approximation of efficacy, nor a reasonable accommodation
of competing state and private interests. Rather, the regulation distinguishes among the indistinct, permitting a
variety of speech that poses the same risks the Government purports to fear, while banning messages unlikely to
cause any harm at all. Considering the manner in which

$ 1304 and its exceptions operate and the scope of the speech
it proscribes, the Government's second asserted interest provides no more convincing basis for upholding the regulation
than the first.

Accordingly, respondents cannot overcome the presumption that the speaker and the audience, not the Government,
should be left to assess the value of accurate and nonmisleading information about lawful conduct. Edenfield, 507
U. S., at 767. Had the Federal Government adopted a more
coherent policy, or accommodated the rights of speakers in
States that have legalized the underlying conduct, see Edge,
509 U. S., at 428, this might be a different case. But under
current federal law, as applied to petitioners and the messages that they wish to convey, the broadcast prohibition in
18 U. S. C. $ 1304 and 47 CFR $ 73.1211 (1998) violates the

modating the policies of both lottery and nonlottery States." 509 U. S.,
at 429-430. The Government points out that Edge hypothesized that
Congress "might have" held fast to a more consistent and broader antigambling policy by continuing to ban all radio or television advertisements
for state-run lotteries, even by stations licensed in States with legalized
lotteries. Id., at 428. That dictum does not support the validity of the
speech restriction in this case. In that passage, we identified the actual
federal interest at stake; we did not endorse any and all nationwide bans
on nonmisleading broadcast advertising related to lotteries. As the Court
explained, "Instead of favoring either the lottery or the nonlottery State,
Congress opted to" accommodate the policies of both; and it was "[t]his
congressional policy of balancing the interests of lottery and nonlottery
States" that was "the substantial governmental interest that satisfie[d]
Central Hudson." Ibid.

Chief Justice Rehnquist, concurring.
Title 18 U. S. C. $ 1304 regulates broadcast advertisingof lotteries and casino gambling. I agree with the Court

that "[t]he operation of $ 1304 and its attendant regulatoryregime is so pierced by exemptions and inconsistencies,"
ante, at 190, that it violates the First Amendment. But, asthe Court observes:

"There surely are practical and nonspeech-related formsof regulation--including a prohibition or supervision of

or betting limits; location restrictions; and licensingrequirements--that could more directly and effectively

Ante, at 192.

Were Congress to undertake substantive regulation of thegambling industry, rather than simply the manner in which

it may broadcast advertisements, "exemptions and incon-sistencies" such as those in $ 1304 might well prove constitutionally tolerable. "The problem of legislative classification is a perennial one, admitting of no doctrinaire definition.Evils in the same field may be of different dimensions and

proportions, requiring different remedies. Or so the legisla-ture may think. Or the reform may take one step at a time,
addressing itself to the phase of the problem which seemsmost acute to the legislative mind. The legislature may select one phase of one field and apply a remedy there, neglect-ing the others."

Syllabus

CUNNINGHAM v. HAMILTON COUNTY, OHIO
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe sixth circuit

No. 98-727. Argued April 19, 1999--Decided June 14, 1999
When petitioner, an attorney representing a plaintiff, failed to comply with

certain discovery orders, the Magistrate Judge granted the respondent's
motion for sanctions against petitioner under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(a)(4). The District Court affirmed the sanctions order and
also disqualified petitioner as counsel. Although the District Court
proceedings were ongoing, petitioner immediately appealed the order
affirming the sanctions award. Because federal appellate court jurisdiction is ordinarily limited to appeals from "final decisions of the district courts," 28 U. S. C. $ 1291, the Sixth Circuit dismissed for lack of
jurisdiction. It held that the sanctions order was not immediately appealable under the collateral order doctrine, which provides that certain
orders may be appealed, notwithstanding the absence of final judgment,
but only when they are conclusive, resolve important questions separate
from the merits, and are effectively unreviewable on appeal from the
final judgment in the underlying action, e. g., Swint v. Chambers County
Comm'n, 514 U. S. 35, 42. The court found these conditions unsatisfied
because the issues involved in petitioner's appeal were not completely
separate from the merits. Regarding petitioner's disqualification, the
court held that a nonparticipating attorney, like a participating attorney,
ordinarily must await final disposition of the underlying case before filing an appeal. It avoided deciding whether the order was effectively
unreviewable absent an immediate appeal, but saw no reason why, after
final judgment in the underlying case, a sanctioned attorney should be
unable to appeal a sanctions order.

Held: An order imposing sanctions on an attorney pursuant to Rule

37(a)(4) is not a "final decision" under $ 1291, even where the attorney
no longer represents a party in the case. Although the Rule 37 sanction
imposed on petitioner would not ordinarily be considered a "final decision" because it neither ended the litigation nor left the court only to
execute its judgment, see, e. g., Midland Asphalt Corp. v. United States,
489 U. S. 794, 798, this Court has interpreted $ 1291 to permit jurisdiction over appeals that meet the conditions of the collateral order doctrine. Respondent conceded that the sanctions order was conclusive,
so at least one of those conditions is presumed to have been satisfied.

199Cite as: 527 U. S. 198 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
Appellate review of a Rule 37(a) sanctions order, however, cannot remain completely separate from the merits. See, e. g., Van Cauwenberghe v. Biard, 486 U. S. 517, 521-522. Here, some of the sanctions
were based on the fact that petitioner provided partial responses and
objections to some of the defendants' discovery requests. To evaluate
whether those sanctions were appropriate, an appellate court would
have to assess the completeness of her responses. Such an inquiry
would differ only marginally from an inquiry into the merits. Petitioner's argument that a sanctions order is effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment suffers from at least two flaws. First, it
ignores the identity of interests between the attorney and client. The
effective congruence of those interests counsels against treating attorneys like other nonparties, since attorneys assume an ethical obligation to serve their clients' interests even where they might have a personal interest in seeking vindication from the sanctions order. See
Richardson-Merrell Inc. v. Koller, 472 U. S. 424, 434-435. Second, unlike a contempt order, a Rule 37(a) sanctions order lacks any prospective
effect and is not designed to compel compliance. To permit an immediate appeal would undermine the very purposes of Rule 37(a), which was
designed to protect courts and opposing parties from delaying or harassing tactics during discovery, and would undermine trial judges' discretion to structure a sanction in the most effective manner. Finally, a
Rule 37 sanction's appealability should not turn on an attorney's continued participation, as such a rule could not be easily administered and
may be subject to abuse. Although a sanctions order may sometimes
impose hardship on an attorney, solutions other than an expansive interpretation of $ 1291's "final decision" requirement remain available.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.
Federal courts of appeals ordinarily have jurisdiction overappeals from "final decisions of the district courts." 28

U. S. C. $ 1291. This case presents the question whether anorder imposing sanctions on an attorney pursuant to Federal
Rule of Civil Procedure 37(a)(4) is a final decision. We holdthat it is not, even where, as here, the attorney no longer
represents a party in the case.

I
Petitioner, an attorney, represented Darwin Lee Starcherin a federal civil rights suit filed against respondent and

other defendants. Starcher brought the suit after his son,Casey, committed suicide while an inmate at the Hamilton
County Justice Center.1 The theory of the original com-plaint was that the defendants willfully ignored their duty to
care for Casey despite his known history of suicide attempts.A Magistrate Judge oversaw discovery. On May 29, 1996,
petitioner was served with a request for interrogatories anddocuments; responses were due within 30 days after service.
See Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 33(b)(3), 34(b). This deadline,however, passed without compliance. The Magistrate Judge
ordered the plaintiff "by 4:00 p.m. on July 12, 1996 to makefull and complete responses" to defendants' requests for interrogatories and documents and further ordered that fourwitnesses--Rex Smith, Roxanne Dieffenbach, and two individual defendants--be deposed on July 25, 1996.

Opinion of the Court
order, she noticed the deposition of Rex Smith on July 22,1996, not July 25, and then refused to withdraw this notice

despite reminders from defendants' counsel. And eventhough the Magistrate Judge had specified that the individual defendants were to be deposed only if plaintiff hadcomplied with his order to produce "full and complete"
responses, she filed a motion to compel their appearance.Respondent and other defendants then filed motions for sanctions against petitioner.At a July 19 hearing, the Magistrate Judge granted the
defendants' motions for sanctions. In a subsequent order,he found that petitioner had violated the discovery order and
described her conduct as "egregious." App. to Pet. for Cert.9a. Relying on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(a)(4), the
Magistrate Judge ordered petitioner to pay the HamiltonCounty treasurer $1,494, representing costs and fees incurred by the Hamilton County prosecuting attorney ascounsel for respondent and one individual defendant.

2 He

took care to specify, however, that he had not held a con-tempt hearing and that petitioner was never found to be in

contempt of court.The District Court affirmed the Magistrate Judge's sanctions order. The court noted that the matter "ha[d] alreadyconsumed an inordinate amount of the Court's time" and described the Magistrate's job of overseeing discovery as a"task assum[ing] the qualities of a full time occupation."
App. to Pet. for Cert. 10a. It found that "[t]he MagistrateJudge did not err in concluding that sanctions were appropriate" and that "the amount of the Magistrate Judge'saward was not contrary to law."

Id., at 11a. The DistrictCourt also granted several defendants' motions to disqualify

petitioner as counsel for plaintiff due to the fact that she wasa material witness in the case.

2 He also ordered petitioner to pay $2,432 as costs and fees incurred by
other defendants in the case. Those sanctions were later satisfied pursuant to a settlement agreement and are not at issue in this appeal.

202 CUNNINGHAM v. HAMILTON COUNTY

Opinion of the Court
Although proceedings in the District Court were ongoing,petitioner immediately appealed the District Court's order

affirming the Magistrate Judge's sanctions award to theUnited States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. The
Court of Appeals, over a dissent, dismissed the appeal for
lack of jurisdiction. Starcher v. Correctional Medical Systems, Inc., 144 F. 3d 418 (1998). It considered whether the
sanctions order was immediately appealable under the collat-eral order doctrine, which provides that certain orders may

be appealed, notwithstanding the absence of final judgment,but only when they "are conclusive, . . . resolve important
questions separate from the merits, and . . . are effectively
unreviewable on appeal from the final judgment in the underlying action." Swint v. Chambers County Comm'n, 514
U. S. 35, 42 (1995) (citing Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial
Loan Corp., 337 U. S. 541, 546 (1949)). In the Sixth Circuit's
view, these conditions were not satisfied because the issues
involved in petitioner's appeal were not "completely separate" from the merits. 144 F. 3d, at 424. As for the fact
that petitioner had been disqualified as counsel, the court
held that "a non-participating attorney, like a participating
attorney, ordinarily must wait until final disposition of the
underlying case before filing an appeal." Id., at 425. It
avoided deciding whether the order was effectively unreviewable absent an immediate appeal but saw "no reason
why, after final resolution of the underlying case . . . a sanctioned attorney should be unable to appeal the order imposing sanctions." Ibid.

The Federal Courts of Appeals disagree over whether an
order of Rule 37(a) sanctions against an attorney is immediately appealable under $ 1291. Compare, e. g., Eastern
Maico Distributors, Inc. v. Maico-Fahrzeugfabrik, G.m.b.h.,
658 F. 2d 944, 946-951 (CA3 1981) (order not immediately
appealable), with Telluride Management Solutions, Inc. v.

Section 1291 of the Judicial Code generally vests courts ofappeals with jurisdiction over appeals from "final decisions"

of the district courts. It descends from the Judiciary Act of1789, where "the First Congress established the principle
that only `final judgments and decrees' of the federal districtcourts may be reviewed on appeal."

Midland Asphalt
Corp. v. United States, 489 U. S. 794, 798 (1989) (quoting 1Stat. 84); see generally Crick, The Final Judgment as a Basis

for Appeal, 41 Yale L. J. 539, 548-551 (1932) (discussing his-tory of final judgment rule in the United States). In accord
with this historical understanding, we have repeatedly inter-preted $ 1291 to mean that an appeal ordinarily will not lie
until after final judgment has been entered in a case. See,
e. g., Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co., 517 U. S. 706, 712(1996); Digital Equipment Corp. v. Desktop Direct, Inc., 511

U. S. 863, 867 (1994); Richardson-Merrell Inc. v. Koller, 472U. S. 424, 430 (1985). As we explained in Firestone Tire &
Rubber Co. v. Risjord, 449 U. S. 368 (1981), the final judg-ment rule serves several salutary purposes:

"It emphasizes the deference that appellate courts oweto the trial judge as the individual initially called upon
to decide the many questions of law and fact that occurin the course of a trial. Permitting piecemeal appeals
would undermine the independence of the district judge,as well as the special role that individual plays in our
judicial system. In addition, the rule is in accordancewith the sensible policy of avoid[ing] the obstruction to
just claims that would come from permitting the harass-ment and cost of a succession of separate appeals from

3 Petitioner also sought review of the Sixth Circuit's decision to apply
its appealability ruling to petitioner rather than to apply that ruling only
prospectively. We declined to review this question.

Opinion of the Court
the various rulings to which a litigation may give rise,from its initiation to entry of judgment. The rule also

serves the important purpose of promoting efficient ju-dicial administration." Id., at 374 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).
Consistent with these purposes, we have held that a decisionis not final, ordinarily, unless it " `ends the litigation on the

merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but executethe judgment.' "

Van Cauwenberghe v. Biard, 486 U. S. 517,521-522 (1988) (quoting

Catlin v. United States, 324 U. S. 229,233 (1945)).

The Rule 37 sanction imposed on petitioner neither endedthe litigation nor left the court only to execute its judgment.
Thus, it ordinarily would not be considered a final decisionunder $ 1291. See, e. g., Midland Asphalt Corp., supra, at
798; Richardson-Merrell, supra, at 430. However, we haveinterpreted the term "final decision" in $ 1291 to permit jurisdiction over appeals from a small category of orders thatdo not terminate the litigation.

E. g., Quackenbush, supra,at 711-715; Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority v.

Metcalf & Eddy, Inc., 506 U. S. 139, 142-147 (1993); Mitchellv. Forsyth, 472 U. S. 511, 524-530 (1985); Cohen, supra, at
545-547. "That small category includes only decisions thatare conclusive, that resolve important questions separate
from the merits, and that are effectively unreviewable onappeal from the final judgment in the underlying action."
Swint, supra, at 42.4

4 Most of our collateral order decisions have considered whether an
order directed at a party to the litigation is immediately appealable. E. g.,
Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U. S. 463, 468-469 (1978). Petitioner,
of course, was an attorney representing the plaintiff in the case. It is
nevertheless clear that a decision does not automatically become final
merely because it is directed at someone other than a plaintiff or defendant. See Richardson-Merrell Inc. v. Koller, 472 U. S. 424, 434-435 (1985)
(rejecting, as outside collateral order doctrine, immediate appeal of order
disqualifying counsel). For example, we have repeatedly held that a wit527US1 Unit: $U74 [05-02-01 17:29:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
Respondent conceded that the sanctions order was conclu-sive, Brief in Opposition 11, so at least one of the collateral

order doctrine's conditions is presumed to have been satis-fied. We do not think, however, that appellate review of a
sanctions order can remain completely separate from themerits. See

Van Cauwenberghe, supra, at 527-530; Coo-pers & Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U. S. 463, 469 (1978). In

Van Cauwenberghe, for example, we held that the denial ofa motion to dismiss on the ground of forum non conveniens
was not a final decision. We reasoned that consideration ofthe factors underlying that decision such as "the relative
ease of access to sources of proof " and "the availability of
witnesses" required trial courts to "scrutinize the substanceof the dispute between the parties to evaluate what proof is

required, and determine whether the pieces of evidence citedby the parties are critical, or even relevant, to the plaintiff 's
cause of action and to any potential defenses to the action."486 U. S., at 528. Similarly, in

Coopers & Lybrand, we held
that a determination that an action may not be maintainedas a class action also was not a final decision, noting that

such a determination was enmeshed in the legal and factual
aspects of the case. 437 U. S., at 469.Much like the orders at issue in

Van Cauwenberghe and
Coopers & Lybrand, a Rule 37(a) sanctions order often willbe inextricably intertwined with the merits of the action.

An evaluation of the appropriateness of sanctions may re-quire the reviewing court to inquire into the importance of
the information sought or the adequacy or truthfulness of aresponse. See,

e. g., Thomas E. Hoar, Inc. v. Sara Lee Corp.,
882 F. 2d 682, 687 (CA2 1989) (adequacy of responses); Outley

ness subject to a discovery order, but not held in contempt, generally
may not appeal the order. See, e. g., United States Catholic Conference
v. Abortion Rights Mobilization, Inc., 487 U. S. 72, 76 (1988); United
States v. Ryan, 402 U. S. 530, 533-534 (1971); Cobbledick v. United States,
309 U. S. 323, 327-330 (1940); Webster Coal & Coke Co. v. Cassatt, 207 U. S.

Opinion of the Court
v. New York, 837 F. 2d 587, 590-591 (CA2 1988) (importanceof incomplete answers to interrogatories);

Evanson v. Union
Oil Company of Cal., 619 F. 2d 72, 74 (Temp. Emerg. Ct.App. 1980) (truthfulness of responses). Some of the sanctions in this case were based on the fact that petitioner
provided partial responses and objections to some of the de-fendants' discovery requests. To evaluate whether those

sanctions were appropriate, an appellate court would have toassess the completeness of petitioner's responses. See Fed.
Rule Civ. Proc. 37(a)(3) ("For purposes of this subdivision anevasive or incomplete disclosure, answer, or response is to
be treated as a failure to disclose, answer, or respond").
Such an inquiry would differ only marginally from an inquiry
into the merits and counsels against application of the collateral order doctrine. Perhaps not every discovery sanction
will be inextricably intertwined with the merits, but we have
consistently eschewed a case-by-case approach to deciding
whether an order is sufficiently collateral. See, e. g., Digital
Equipment Corp., 511 U. S., at 868; Richardson-Merrell, 472
U. S., at 439.

Even if the merits were completely divorced from the
sanctions issue, the collateral order doctrine requires that
the order be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final
judgment. Petitioner claims that this is the case. In support, she relies on a line of decisions holding that one who is
not a party to a judgment generally may not appeal from it.
See, e. g., Karcher v. May, 484 U. S. 72, 77 (1987). She also
posits that contempt orders imposed on witnesses who disobey discovery orders are immediately appealable and argues that the sanctions order in this case should be treated
no differently.

Petitioner's argument suffers from at least two flaws. It
ignores the identity of interests between the attorney and
client. Unlike witnesses, whose interests may differ substantially from the parties', attorneys assume an ethical obligation to serve their clients' interests. Evans v. Jeff D., 475

207Cite as: 527 U. S. 198 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
U. S. 717, 728 (1986). This obligation remains even wherethe attorney might have a personal interest in seeking vindication from the sanctions order. See Richardson-Merrell,supra, at 434-435. In Richardson-Merrell, we held that an
order disqualifying an attorney was not an immediately ap-pealable final decision. 472 U. S., at 429-440; see also

Flan-agan v. United States, 465 U. S. 259, 263-269 (1984) (order

disqualifying attorney in criminal case not a "final decision"under $ 1291). We explained that "[a]n attorney who is disqualified for misconduct may well have a personal interestin pursuing an immediate appeal, an interest which need
not coincide with the interests of the client. As a matter ofprofessional ethics, however, the decision to appeal should
turn entirely on the client's interest." Richardson-Merrell,
supra, at 435 (citing ABA Model Rules of Professional Con-duct 1.7(b), 2.1 (1985)). This principle has the same force

when an order of discovery sanctions is imposed on the attor-ney alone. See In re Coordinated Pretrial Proceedings in
Petroleum Products Antitrust Litigation, 747 F. 2d 1303,1305 (CA9 1984) (Kennedy, J.). The effective congruence of
interests between clients and attorneys counsels againsttreating attorneys like other nonparties for purposes of
appeal. Cf. United States Catholic Conference v. Abortion
Rights Mobilization, Inc., 487 U. S. 72, 78 (1988).Petitioner's argument also overlooks the significant differences between a finding of contempt and a Rule 37(a) sanc-tions order. "Civil contempt is designed to force the contemnor to comply with an order of the court." Willy v.
Coastal Corp., 503 U. S. 131, 139 (1992). In contrast, a Rule37(a) sanctions order lacks any prospective effect and is not

designed to compel compliance. Judge Adams captured theessential distinction between the two types of orders when
he noted that an order such as civil contempt

"is not simply to deter harassment and delay, but to ef-fect some discovery conduct. A non-party's interest in

resisting a discovery order is immediate and usually sep527US1 Unit: $U74 [05-02-01 17:29:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
arate from the parties' interests in delay. Before finaljudgment is reached, the non-party either will have surrendered the materials sought or will have suffered in-carceration or steadily mounting fines imposed to compel
the discovery. If the discovery is held unwarranted onappeal only after the case is resolved, the non-party's
injury may not be possible to repair. Under Rule 37(a),no similar situation exists. The objective of the Rule
is the prevention of delay and costs to other litigantscaused by the filing of groundless motions. An attorney
sanctioned for such conduct by and large suffers no inor-dinate injury from a deferral of appellate consideration
of the sanction. He need not in the meantime surrenderany rights or suffer undue coercion." Eastern Maico
Distributors, 658 F. 2d, at 949-950 (citation and foot-note omitted).

To permit an immediate appeal from such a sanctions orderwould undermine the very purposes of Rule 37(a), which was
designed to protect courts and opposing parties from de-laying or harassing tactics during the discovery process.

5

5 In 1970, the prerequisites for imposing sanctions were redesigned "to
encourage judges to be more alert to abuses occurring in the discovery
process." Advisory Committee's Notes on Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 37(a)(4),
28 U. S. C., p. 748. Before 1970, the Rule required a court, after granting
a motion to compel discovery but before imposing sanctions, to find the
losing party to have acted without substantial justification. At that time,
courts rarely exercised this authority to impose sanctions. See W. Glaser,
Pretrial Discovery and the Adversary System 154 (1968). While the
amended Rule retained the substantial justification requirement, the
placement of the requirement was changed so that the Rule provided that
the district court, upon granting the motion to compel, "shall" impose the
sanction unless it found that the losing party's conduct was "substantially
justified." The change in placement signaled a shift in presumption about
the appropriateness of sanctions for discovery abuses. See Federal Discovery Rules: Effects of the 1970 Amendments, 8 Colum. J. L. & Soc.
Probs. 623, 642 (1972) ("The Advisory Committee reversed the presumption in Rule 37(a)(4) in order to encourage the awarding of expenses and
fees wherever applicable").

Opinion of the Court
Immediate appeals of such orders would undermine trialjudges' discretion to structure a sanction in the most effective manner. They might choose not to sanction an attor-ney, despite abusive conduct, in order to avoid further delays
in their proceedings. Not only would such an approach ignore the deference owed by appellate courts to trial judgescharged with managing the discovery process, see

Firestone
Tire & Rubber Co., 449 U. S., at 374, it also could forestallresolution of the case as each new sanction would give rise

to a new appeal. The result might well be the very sortsof piecemeal appeals and concomitant delays that the final
judgment rule was designed to prevent.

Petitioner finally argues that, even if an attorney ordinarily may not immediately appeal a sanction order, special
considerations apply when the attorney no longer represents
a party in the case. Like the Sixth Circuit, we do not think
that the appealability of a Rule 37 sanction imposed on an
attorney should turn on the attorney's continued participation. Such a rule could not be easily administered. For
example, it may be unclear precisely when representation
terminates, and questions likely would arise over when the
30-day period for appeal would begin to run under Federal
Rule of Appellate Procedure 4. The rule also could be subject to abuse if attorneys and clients strategically terminated
their representation in order to trigger a right to appeal
with a view to delaying the proceedings in the underlying
case. While we recognize that our application of the final
judgment rule in this setting may require nonparticipating
attorneys to monitor the progress of the litigation after their
work has ended, the efficiency interests served by limiting
immediate appeals far outweigh any nominal monitoring
costs borne by attorneys. For these reasons, an attorney's
continued participation in a case does not affect whether a
sanctions order is "final" for purposes of $ 1291.

We candidly recognize the hardship that a sanctions order
may sometimes impose on an attorney. Should these hard527US1 Unit: $U74 [05-02-01 17:29:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN
210 CUNNINGHAM v. HAMILTON COUNTY

Kennedy, J., concurring
ships be deemed to outweigh the desirability of restrictingappeals to "final decisions," solutions other than an expansive interpretation of $ 1291's "final decision" requirementremain available. Congress may amend the Judicial Code
to provide explicitly for immediate appellate review ofsuch orders. See,

e. g., 28 U. S. C. $$ 1292(a)(1)-(3). Recentamendments to the Judicial Code also have authorized this

Court to prescribe rules providing for the immediate appealof certain orders, see $$ 1292(e), 2072(c), and "Congress' designation of the rulemaking process as the way to define orrefine when a district court ruling is `final' and when an interlocutory order is appealable warrants the Judiciary's fullrespect."

Swint, 514 U. S., at 48 (footnote omitted). Fi-nally, in a particular case, a district court can reduce any

hardship by reserving until the end of the trial decisions suchas whether to impose the sanction, how great a sanction to
impose, or when to order collection.

* * *
For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that a sanctionsorder imposed on an attorney is not a "final decision" under

$ 1291 and, therefore, affirm the judgment of the Court ofAppeals.

It is so ordered.
Justice Kennedy, concurring.
This case comes to our argument docket, of course, so that
we may resolve a split of authority in the Circuits on a juris-dictional issue, not because there is any division of opinion

over the propriety of the underlying conduct. Cases involv-ing sanctions against attorneys all too often implicate allegations that, when true, bring the law into great disrepute.
Delays and abuses in discovery are the source of widespreadinjustice; and were we to hold sanctions orders against attorneys to be appealable as collateral orders, we would riskcompounding the problem for the reasons suggested by

Jus527US1 Unit: $U74 [05-02-01 17:29:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Kennedy, J., concurring
tice Thomas in his opinion for the Court. Trial courtsmust have the capacity to ensure prompt compliance with

their orders, especially when attorneys attempt to abuse thediscovery process to gain a tactical advantage.

It should be noted, however, that an attorney ordered topay sanctions is not without a remedy in every case. If the
trial court declines to stay enforcement of the order and theresult is an exceptional hardship itself likely to cause an injustice, a petition for writ of mandamus might bring the issuebefore the Court of Appeals to determine if the trial court
abused its discretion in issuing the order or denying the stay.See

Richardson-Merrell Inc. v. Koller, 472 U. S. 424, 435(1985). In addition, if a contempt order is entered and there

is no congruence of interests between the person subject tothe order and a party to the underlying litigation, the order
may be appealable. See In re Coordinated Pretrial Proceedings in Petroleum Products Antitrust Litigation, 747F. 2d 1303, 1305-1306 (CA9 1984). In United States Catholic Conference v. Abortion Rights Mobilization, Inc., 487U. S. 72, 76 (1988), a case involving a nonparty witness, we
said: "The right of a nonparty to appeal an adjudication ofcontempt cannot be questioned. The order finding a nonparty witness in contempt is appealable notwithstanding theabsence of a final judgment in the underlying action."

The case before us, however, involves an order for sanc-tions and nothing more. I join the opinion of the Court and
its holding that the order is not appealable under the collat-eral order doctrine.

WEST, SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS v.GIBSON
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe seventh circuit

No. 98-238. Argued April 26, 1999--Decided June 14, 1999
In 1972, Congress extended Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to

prohibit employment discrimination in the Federal Government, 42
U. S. C. $ 2000e-16, to authorize the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC) to enforce that prohibition through "appropriate
remedies, including reinstatement or hiring . . . with or without back
pay," $ 2000e-16(b), and to empower courts to entertain an action by a
complainant still aggrieved after final agency action, $ 2000e-16(c). In
1991, Congress again amended Title VII in the Compensatory Damages
Amendment (CDA), which, among other things, permits victims of intentional discrimination to recover compensatory damages "[i]n an action . . . under [$ 2000e-16]," $ 1981a(a)(1), and adds that any party in
such an action may demand a jury trial, $ 1981a(c). Thereafter, the
EEOC began to grant compensatory damages awards in Federal Government employment discrimination cases. Respondent Gibson filed a
complaint charging that the Department of Veterans Affairs had discriminated against him by denying him a promotion on the basis of his
gender. The EEOC found in his favor and awarded him the promotion
plus backpay. Gibson later filed this suit asking for compensatory damages and other relief, but the District Court dismissed the complaint.
The Seventh Circuit reversed, rejecting the Department's argument
that, because Gibson had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies
with respect to an award of compensatory damages, he could not bring
that claim in court. In the Seventh Circuit's view, the EEOC lacked
the legal power to award compensatory damages; consequently there
was no administrative remedy to exhaust.

Held:

1. The EEOC possesses the legal authority to require federal agencies to pay compensatory damages when they discriminate in employment in violation of Title VII. Read literally, the language of the 1972
Title VII extension and the CDA is consistent with a grant of that authority. Section 2000e-16(b) empowers the EEOC to enforce $ 2000e-
16(a) through a "remedy" that is "appropriate." Although $ 2000e-16(b)
explicitly mentions only equitable remedies--reinstatement, hiring, and
backpay--the preceding word "including" makes clear that the authori527US1 Unit: $U75 [05-02-01 17:34:05] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Syllabus
zation is not limited to the remedies specified. See Phelps Dodge Corp.
v. NLRB, 313 U. S. 177, 189. The 1972 Title VII extension's choice of
examples is not surprising, for in 1972 (and until the 1991 CDA) Title
VII itself authorized only equitable remedies. Words in statutes can
enlarge or contract their scope as required by other changes in the law
or the world. See, e. g., Browder v. United States, 312 U. S. 335, 339-
340. The meaning of the word "appropriate" permits its scope to expand to include Title VII remedies that were not appropriate before
1991, but in light of legal change wrought by the 1991 CDA are appropriate now. Examining the purposes of the 1972 Title VII extension
shows that this is the correct reading. Section 717's general purpose is
to remedy discrimination in federal employment by creating a system
that requires resort to administrative relief prior to court action to encourage quicker, less formal, and less expensive resolution of disputes.
To deny that an EEOC compensatory damages award is, statutorily
speaking, "appropriate" would undermine this remedial scheme. This
point is reinforced by the CDA's history, which says nothing about limiting the EEOC's ability to use the new damages remedy or in any way
suggests that it would be desirable to distinguish the new Title VII
remedy from the old ones. Respondent's arguments in favor of depriving the EEOC of the power to award compensatory damages--that the
CDA's reference to an "action" refers to a judicial case, not to an administrative proceeding; that an EEOC compensatory damages award
would not involve a jury trial, as authorized by the CDA; and that any
waiver of the Government's sovereign immunity to permit the EEOC
to award compensatory damages must be construed narrowly--are unconvincing. Pp. 217-223.

2. Respondent's claims that he can proceed in District Court on alternative grounds include matters that fall outside the scope of the
question presented in the Government's petition for certiorari. The
case is remanded so that the Court of Appeals can determine whether

these questions have been properly raised and, if so, decide them.

Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court.
The question in this case is whether the Equal Employ-ment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) possesses the legal

authority to require federal agencies to pay compensatorydamages when they discriminate in employment in violation
of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 84 Stat. 121, 42U. S. C. $ 2000e

et seq. We conclude that the EEOC doeshave that authority.

I
A

Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 forbids employ-ment discrimination. In 1972 Congress extended Title VII

so that it applies not only to employment in the private sec-tor, but to employment in the Federal Government as well.
See Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972, 86 Stat.111, 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-16. This 1972 Title VII extension,
found in $ 717 of Title VII, has three relevant subsections.The first subsection, $ 717(a), sets forth the basic Federal
Government employment antidiscrimination standard. Itsays that

"[a]ll personnel actions affecting employees or applicantsfor employment [of specified Government agencies and
departments] shall be made free from any discriminationbased on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin."

Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, as amicus curiae urging reversal.

215Cite as: 527 U. S. 212 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
The second subsection, $ 717(b), provides the EEOC withthe power to enforce the standard. It says (among other

things) that

"the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission shall
have authority to enforce the provisions of subsection(a) . . . through appropriate remedies, including reinstatement or hiring of employees with or without backpay, as will effectuate the policies of this section . . . ."
42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-16(b) (emphasis added).
The third subsection, $ 717(c), concerns a court's authorityto enforce the standard. It says that, after an agency or

the EEOC takes final action on a complaint (or fails to takeaction within a certain time),

"an employee or applicant [who is still] aggrieved . . .may file a civil action as provided in section [706, dealing with discrimination by private employers], in whichcivil action the head of the department, agency, or unit,
as appropriate, shall be the defendant." 42 U. S. C.$ 2000e-16(c).

In 1991 Congress again amended Title VII. The amend-ment relevant here permits victims of intentional employment discrimination (whether within the private sector orthe Federal Government) to recover compensatory damages.
See Civil Rights Act of 1991, 105 Stat. 1072, 42 U. S. C.$ 1981a(a)(1). The relevant portion of that amendment,
which we shall call the Compensatory Damages Amendment(CDA), says:

"In an action brought by a complaining party under sec-tion 706 [dealing with discrimination by private employers] or 717 [dealing with discrimination by the FederalGovernment] against a respondent who engaged in unlawful intentional discrimination . . . , the complainingparty may recover compensatory . . . damages . . . ." 42

216 WEST v. GIBSON

Opinion of the Court
The CDA also sets forth certain conditions and exceptions.It imposes, for example, a cap on compensatory damages (of

up to $300,000 for large employers, $ 1981a(b)(3)(D)). And itadds: "If a complaining party seeks compensatory . . . damages under this section . . . any party may demand a trial byjury . . . ." $ 1981a(c). Once the CDA became law, the
EEOC began to grant compensatory damages awards in Fed-eral Government employment discrimination cases. Compare 29 CFR pt. 1613, App. A (1990) (no reference to compen-satory damages in preamendment list of EEOC remedies),
with, e. g., Jackson v. Runyon, EEOC Appeal No. 01923399,p. 3 (Nov. 12, 1992) ("[T]he Civil Rights Act of 1991 . . . makes
compensatory damages available to federal sector complain-ants in the administrative process").

B
Respondent, Michael Gibson, filed a complaint with the De-partment of Veterans Affairs charging that the Department

had discriminated against him by denying him a promotionon the basis of his gender. The Department found against
Gibson. The EEOC, however, subsequently found in Gib-son's favor and awarded the promotion plus backpay. Three
months later Gibson filed a complaint in Federal DistrictCourt, asking the court to order the Department to comply
immediately with the EEOC's order and also to pay com-pensatory damages. Complaint || 17 (App. 28). The Department then voluntarily complied with the EEOC's order,but it continued to oppose Gibson's claim for compensatory
damages.Eventually, the District Court dismissed Gibson's compensatory damages claim. On appeal, the Department sup-ported the District Court's dismissal with the argument that
Gibson had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies inrespect to his compensatory damages claim; hence, he could
not bring that claim in court. Gibson v. Brown, 137 F. 3d992, 994 (CA7 1998). The Seventh Circuit, however, re527US1 Unit: $U75 [05-02-01 17:34:05] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
versed the District Court's dismissal. It rejected the De-partment's argument because, in its view, the EEOC lacked

the legal power to award compensatory damages; conse-quently there was no administrative remedy to exhaust.
Id., at 995-998.Because the Circuits have disagreed about whether the
EEOC has the power to award compensatory damages, com-pare

Fitzgerald v. Secretary, Dept. of Veterans Affairs, 121F. 3d 203, 207 (CA5 1997) (EEOC may award compensatory

damages), with Crawford v. Babbitt, 148 F. 3d 1318, 1326(CA11 1998) (EEOC cannot award compensatory damages),
and 137 F. 3d, at 996-998 (same), we granted certiorari inorder to decide that question.

II
The language, purposes, and history of the 1972 Title VIIextension and the 1991 CDA convince us that Congress

has authorized the EEOC to award compensatory damagesin Federal Government employment discrimination cases.
Read literally, the language of the statutes is consistent witha grant of that authority. The relevant portion of the Title
VII extension, namely, $ 717(b), says that the EEOC "shallhave authority" to enforce $ 717(a) "through

appropriateremedies, including reinstatement or hiring of employees

with or without back pay." 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-16(b). Afterenactment of the 1991 CDA, an award of compensatory damages is a "remedy" that is "appropriate."We recognize that $ 717(b) explicitly mentions certain
equitable remedies, namely, reinstatement, hiring, and back-pay, and it does not explicitly refer to compensatory damages. But the preceding word "including" makes clear thatthe authorization is not limited to the specified remedies
there mentioned; and the 1972 Title VII extension's choice ofexamples is not surprising, for in 1972 (and until 1991) Title
VII itself authorized only equitable remedies. See CivilRights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 261, 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-5(g) (pri527US1 Unit: $U75 [05-02-01 17:34:05] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
vate sector discrimination); Equal Employment Opportunity
Act of 1972, 86 Stat. 111, 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-16 (federal sector discrimination).

Section 717's language, however, does not freeze the scope
of the word "appropriate" as of 1972. Words in statutes can
enlarge or contract their scope as other changes, in law or in
the world, require their application to new instances or make
old applications anachronistic. See, e. g., Browder v. United
States, 312 U. S. 335, 339-340 (1941) (new, unforeseen "use"
of passport); see also United States v. Southwestern Cable
Co., 392 U. S. 157, 172-173 (1968) (cable television as "communications"); Fortnightly Corp. v. United Artists Television,
Inc., 392 U. S. 390, 395-396 (1968) (old statutory language
read to reflect technological change).

The meaning of the word "appropriate" permits its scope
to expand to include Title VII remedies that were not appropriate before 1991, but in light of legal change are appropriate now. The word "including" makes clear that "appropriate remedies" are not limited to the examples that follow
that word. See Phelps Dodge Corp. v. NLRB, 313 U. S. 177,
189 (1941). And in context the word "appropriate" most
naturally refers to forms of relief that Title VII itself authorizes--at least where that relief is of a kind that agencies
typically can provide. Thus, Congress' decision in the 1991
CDA to permit a "complaining party" to "recover compensatory damages" in "an action brought under section . . . 717,"
by adding compensatory damages to Title VII's arsenal of
remedies, could make that form of relief "appropriate" under

$ 717(b) as well.

An examination of the purposes of the 1972 Title VII extension shows that this permissible reading of the language
is also the correct reading. Section 717's general purpose is
to remedy discrimination in federal employment. It does so
in part by creating a dispute resolution system that requires
a complaining party to pursue administrative relief prior to

Opinion of the Court
court action, thereby encouraging quicker, less formal, and
less expensive resolution of disputes within the Federal Government and outside of court. See 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-16(c)
(court action permitted only where complainant disagrees
with final agency disposition or, if complainant pursued discretionary appeal to EEOC, with EEOC disposition; or if
either agency or EEOC disposition is delayed); Brown v.
GSA, 425 U. S. 820, 833 (1976) (discussing $ 717's "rigorous
administrative exhaustion requirements"); see also 29 CFR

$ 1614.105(a) (1998) (requiring complainant initially to notify
agency and make effort to resolve matter informally);

$ 1614.106(d)(2) (requiring agency investigation prior to
EEOC consideration).

To deny that an EEOC compensatory damages award is,
statutorily speaking, "appropriate" would undermine this remedial scheme. It would force into court matters that the
EEOC might otherwise have resolved. And by preventing
earlier resolution of a dispute, it would increase the burdens
of both time and expense that accompany efforts to resolve
hundreds, if not thousands, of such disputes each year. See
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Federal Sector
Report on EEO Complaints Processing and Appeals by Federal Agencies for Fiscal Year 1997, pp. 19, 61 (1998) (28,947
Federal Government employment discrimination claims filed
in 1997; 7,112 claims appealed to EEOC); Reply Brief for
Petitioner 12-13, n. 9 (estimating "hundreds" of cases each
year that involve claims for compensatory damages).

The history of the CDA reinforces this point. The CDA's
sponsors and supporters spoke frequently of the need to create a new remedy in order, for example, to "help make victims whole." H. R. Rep. No. 102-40, pt. 1, pp. 64-65 (1991);
see also Civil Rights Act of 1991, $ 2, 105 Stat. 1071, 42
U. S. C. $ 1981 note (congressional finding that "additional
remedies under Federal law are needed to deter . . . intentional discrimination in the workplace"); id., $ 3 (one purpose

of Act is "to provide appropriate remedies for intentional
discrimination . . . in the workplace"); 137 Cong. Rec. 28636-
28638, 28663-28667, 28676-28680 (1991) (introduction and
discussion of Danforth/Kennedy Amendment No. 1274, in relevant part permitting recovery of compensatory damages);
id., at 28880-28881 (statements of Sen. Warner and Sen. Kennedy) (clarifying that Danforth/Kennedy amendment covers
federal employees and suggesting amendment to this effect).
But the CDA's sponsors and supporters said nothing about
limiting the EEOC's ability to use the new Title VII remedy
or suggesting that it would be desirable to distinguish the
new Title VII remedy from old Title VII remedies in that
respect. This total silence is not surprising. What reason
could there be for Congress, anxious to have the EEOC consider as a preliminary matter every other possible remedy,
not to want the EEOC similarly to consider compensatory
damages as well?

Respondent makes three important arguments in favor of
a more limited interpretation of the statutes--an interpretation that would deprive the EEOC of the power to award
compensatory damages. First, respondent points out that
the CDA says nothing about the EEOC, or EEOC proceedings, but rather states only that a complaining party may
recover compensatory damages "in an action brought under
section . . . 717." 42 U. S. C. $ 1981a(a)(1) (emphasis added).
And the word "action" often refers to judicial cases, not
to administrative "proceedings." See New York Gaslight
Club, Inc. v. Carey, 447 U. S. 54, 60-62 (1980) (distinguishing
civil "actions" from administrative "proceedings").

Had Congress thought it important so to limit the scope
of the CDA, however, it could easily have cross-referenced

$ 717(c), the civil action subsection itself, rather than crossreferencing the whole of $ 717, which includes authorization
for the EEOC to enforce the section through "appropriate
remedies." Regardless, the question, as we see it, is

527US1 Unit: $U75 [05-02-01 17:34:05] PAGES PGT: OPIN

221Cite as: 527 U. S. 212 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
whether, by using the word "action," Congress intended to
deny that compensatory damages is "appropriate" administrative relief within the terms of $ 717(b). In light of the
previous discussion, see supra, at 217-220, we do not believe
the simple use of the word "action" in the context of a crossreference to the whole of $ 717 indicates an intent to deprive
the EEOC of that authority.

Second, in an effort to explain why Congress might have
wanted to impose a special EEOC-related limitation in respect to compensatory damages, respondent points to the
language in the CDA that says: "If a complaining party seeks
compensatory . . . damages under this section . . . any party
may demand a trial by jury." 42 U. S. C. $ 1981a(c) (emphasis added). Respondent notes that an EEOC compensatory
damages award would not involve a jury. And an agency
cannot proceed to court under $ 717(c) because that subsection makes a court action available only to an aggrieved complaining party, not to the agency. $ 2000e-16(c). Thus, respondent concludes that the CDA must implicitly forbid any
such EEOC award, for that award would take place without
the jury trial that $ 1981a(c) guarantees.

This argument, however, draws too much from too little.
One easily can read the jury trial provision in $ 1981a(c) as
simply guaranteeing either party a jury trial in respect to
compensatory damages if a complaining party proceeds to
court under $ 717(c). The words "under this section" in

$ 1981a(c) support that interpretation, for "this section,"

$ 1981a, refers primarily to court proceedings. And there is
no reason to believe Congress intended more. The history
of the jury trial provision suggests that Congress saw the
provision primarily as a benefit to complaining parties, not to
the Government. See, e. g., 137 Cong. Rec., at 29051-29052
(statement of Sen. Leahy) (for "the first time, women and
the disabled could recover damages and have jury trials for
claims of intentional discrimination"); id., at 30668 (state527US1 Unit: $U75 [05-02-01 17:34:05] PAGES PGT: OPIN
222 WEST v. GIBSON

Opinion of the Court
ment of Rep. Ford) (provision will "provid[e] all victims of
intentional discrimination a right to trial by jury"); see also,
e. g., id., at 29053-29054 (statement of Sen. Wallop) (discussing "economically devastating lawsuits"); id., at 29041 (statement of Sen. Bumpers) (relating fears about "runaway jur[ies]"). The fact that Congress permits an employee to file
a complaint in court, but forbids the agency to challenge an
adverse EEOC decision in court, also suggests that Congress
was not inordinately and unusually concerned with invoking
special judicial safeguards to protect the Government.

Finally, respondent argues that insofar as the law permits
the EEOC to award compensatory damages, it waives the
Government's sovereign immunity, and we must construe
any such waiver narrowly. See Lane v. Pen~ a, 518 U. S. 187,
192 (1996); Lehman v. Nakshian, 453 U. S. 156, 160-161
(1981). There is no dispute, however, that the CDA waives
sovereign immunity in respect to an award of compensatory
damages. Whether, in light of that waiver, the CDA permits the EEOC to consider the same matter at an earlier
phase of the employment discrimination claim is a distinct
question concerning how the waived damages remedy is to
be administered. Because the relationship of this kind of
administrative question to the goals and purposes of the
doctrine of sovereign immunity may be unclear, ordinary
sovereign immunity presumptions may not apply. In the
Secretary's view here, for example, the EEOC's preliminary
consideration, by lowering the costs of resolving disputes,
does not threaten, but helps to protect, the public fisc. Regardless, if we must apply a specially strict standard in such
a case, which question we need not decide, that standard is
met here. We believe that the statutory language, taken
together with statutory purposes, history, and the absence
of any convincing reason for denying the EEOC the relevant
power, produce evidence of a waiver that satisfies the
stricter standard.

Opinion of the Court
For these reasons, we conclude that the EEOC possessesthe legal authority to enforce $ 717 through an award of compensatory damages. III

Respondent asks us to affirm on alternative grounds theSeventh Circuit's judgment permitting his case to proceed
in the District Court. The Seventh Circuit consideredwhether Gibson had "asked the EEOC for compensatory
damages." 137 F. 3d, at 994. It added that if "he did, thenthe government's failure-to-exhaust argument obviously is
a non-starter." Ibid. But the Court of Appeals concludedthat Gibson did not "put the EEOC on notice that he
was seeking compensatory damages." Ibid. Respondentclaims that he can proceed in District Court because he did
satisfy the law's exhaustion requirements, even if the EEOChas the legal power to award compensatory damages and
even if he did not give notice to the EEOC that he soughtcompensatory damages. He argues that is so because (1)
the requirement of notice for exhaustion purposes is unusu-ally weak in respect to compensatory damages, (2) he did
request a "monetary cash award," and (3) special circum-stances estop the Government from asserting a "no exhaustion" claim in this case.These matters fall outside the scope of the question presented in the Government's petition for certiorari. See Roberts v. Galen of Va., Inc., 525 U. S. 249, 253-254 (1999) (percuriam). We remand the case so that the Court of Appeals

can determine whether these questions have been properlyraised and, if so, decide them.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and thecase is remanded for further proceedings consistent with

Kennedy, J., dissenting
Justice Kennedy, with whom The Chief Justice,
Justice Scalia, and Justice Thomas join, dissenting.

The rules governing this case are clear and well estab-lished, or at least had been before the majority's unsettling

opinion today. Relief may not be awarded against theUnited States unless it has waived its sovereign immunity.
See Department of Army v. Blue Fox, Inc., 525 U. S. 255(1999). The waiver must be expressed in unequivocal statutory text and cannot be implied. Id., at 261; Lane v. Pen~ a,518 U. S. 187, 192 (1996). Even when the United States has
waived its immunity, the waiver must be "strictly construed,in terms of its scope, in favor of the sovereign,"

Blue Fox,supra, at 261; accord, Lane, supra, at 192, for " `this Court

has long decided that limitations and conditions upon whichthe Government consents to be sued must be strictly observed and exceptions thereto are not to be implied,' " Lehman v. Nakshian, 453 U. S. 156, 161 (1981), quoting Sorianov. United States, 352 U. S. 270, 276 (1957). Not only do these

rules reserve authority over the public fisc to the branch ofGovernment with which the Constitution has placed it, they
also form an important part of the background of settled
legal principles upon which Congress relied in enacting vari-ous statutes authorizing suits against the United States, such

as the Tucker Act, 28 U. S. C. $ 1491; $ 10(a) of the Adminis-trative Procedure Act, 5 U. S. C. $ 702; and the Federal Tort
Claims Act, 28 U. S. C. $ 2671 et seq. The rules governingwaivers of sovereign immunity make clear that the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) may notaward or authorize compensatory damages against the
United States unless it is permitted to do so by a statutory
provision which waives the United States' immunity to theawards in clear and unambiguous terms.

Section 717(b) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-16(b), which authorizes the EEOC to enforce federal compliance with Title VII "through appropriateremedies, including reinstatement or hiring of employees

Kennedy, J., dissenting
with or without back pay," effects a waiver of the UnitedStates' sovereign immunity for some purposes. Unlike

other similar statutes, however, the provision does not men-tion awards of compensatory damages. Compare $ 717(b)
with 2 U. S. C. $$ 1311(b)(1)(B), 1405(g) (1994 ed., Supp. III).
A waiver of immunity to other types of relief does notprovide the unequivocal statement required to establish a

waiver of immunity to damages awards. See United Statesv.

Nordic Village, Inc., 503 U. S. 30, 34 (1992) ("Though [11
U. S. C. $ 106(c)], too, waives sovereign immunity, it fails toestablish unambiguously that the waiver extends to monetary claims"); Lane, supra, at 192.

Nor does the statutory grant of authority to the EEOC to
enforce Title VII through appropriate remedies include, in
unequivocal terms or even by necessary implication, the
power to award or authorize compensatory damages. Even
if the phrase "appropriate remedies" had been intended, as
the majority maintains, to incorporate relief authorized for
violations of Title VII under other statutory provisions, it is
not obvious that the phrase's meaning would have been intended also to "expand" to include remedies that were not
available at the time $ 717 was adopted. Ante, at 218.

It is far from clear, moreover, that the phrase was intended to incorporate other statutory provisions at all. Unlike other subsections of $ 717, see $ 717(d) (incorporating
various provisions relating to judicial actions), $ 717(b) does
not make an explicit reference to other statutory provisions.
In addition, the specific examples given by the statute of
appropriate remedies--reinstatement or hiring of employees
with or without backpay--are equitable in nature. See
United States v. Burke, 504 U. S. 229, 238 (1992). The interpretive canons of noscitur a sociis and ejusdem generis
suggest the appropriate remedies authorized by $ 717(b)
are remedies of the same nature as reinstatement, hiring,
and backpay--i. e., equitable remedies. The phrase "appropriate remedies," furthermore, connotes the remedial discre527US1 Unit: $U75 [05-02-01 17:34:06] PAGES PGT: OPIN
226 WEST v. GIBSON

Kennedy, J., dissenting
tion which is the hallmark of equity. A plausible, and per-haps even the best, interpretation of $ 717(b), then, is that it

grants administrative authority to determine which of thetraditional forms of equitable relief are appropriate in any
given case of discrimination. Whether or not this is the bet-ter reading, it should suffice to establish beyond dispute that
the statute does not authorize awards of compensatory dam-ages in express and unequivocal terms. As a consequence,

$ 717(b) cannot provide the required waiver of the UnitedStates' sovereign immunity.

Unlike $ 717(b), 42 U. S. C. $ 1981a does authorize awardsof compensatory damages against the United States. Although it is clear the statute authorizes courts to award dam-ages, however, $ 1981a does not so much as mention the
EEOC, much less empower it to award or authorize moneydamages. It is settled law that a waiver of sovereign immunity in one forum does not effect a waiver in other forums.See, e. g., McElrath v. United States, 102 U. S. 426, 440 (1880)
("[The Government] can declare in what court it may besued, and prescribe the forms of pleading and the rules of
practice to be observed in such suits"); Great Northern Life
Ins. Co. v. Read, 322 U. S. 47, 54, n. 6 (1944) ("The FederalGovernment's consent to suit against itself, without more, in

a field of federal power does not authorize a suit in a statecourt"); Case v. Terrell, 11 Wall. 199, 201 (1871) (The United
States' consent to suit in the Court of Claims does not extendto other federal courts).

The majority's attempt to read 42 U. S. C. $ 1981a(a)(1) toauthorize administrative awards of compensatory damages is
not persuasive. Section 1981a(a)(1) provides:

"In an action brought by a complaining party undersection 706 or 717 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 . . .

the complaining party may recover compensatory andpunitive damages as allowed in subsection (b) of this section, in addition to any relief authorized by section706(g) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 . . . ."

Kennedy, J., dissenting
The provision authorizes an award of compensatory dam-ages in an "action" brought under $ 717; the word "action"

is often used to distinguish judicial cases from administra-tive "proceedings." See

New York Gaslight Club, Inc. v.
Carey, 447 U. S. 54, 60-62 (1980). Unlike $ 717(b), which
authorizes administrative proceedings, $ 717(c) authorizes"civil action[s]" in court. It is most natural, therefore, to

understand the phrase "an action brought by a complain-ing party under section . . . 717" as a reference to a judicial
action under $ 717(c) but not to an administrative proceedingunder $ 717(b). Compensatory awards are authorized under

$ 1981a(a)(1), moreover, "in addition to any relief authorized
by section 706(g) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964." Section
706(g) authorizes a "court" to grant equitable relief for violations of Title VII. This provision, as incorporated through

$ 717(d), applies only in "civil actions" brought under $ 717(c);
it does not apply in proceedings before the EEOC or any
other agency. Section 1981a(a)(1)'s express reference to

$ 706(g) confirms that compensatory damages are available
only in judicial actions.

Other provisions of $ 1981a also make clear that the statute
authorizes compensatory damages only in judicial actions.
Section 1981a(c) provides that "[i]f a complaining party seeks
compensatory . . . damages under this section--(1) any party
may demand a trial by jury; and (2) the court shall not inform
the jury of the limitations [on damages awards] described in
subsection (b)(3) of this section." It cannot be disputed that
this provision contemplates a jury trial overseen by a court.
With due respect to the majority, the provision does not
guarantee a jury trial to either party "if a complaining party
proceeds to court under $ 717(c)," ante, at 221; it provides
that either party may obtain a jury trial "[i]f a complaining
party seeks compensatory . . . damages," $ 1981a(c).

While falling short of embracing the argument as its own,
the majority flirts with the contention that allowing agencies
rather than juries to award compensatory damages lowers

Kennedy, J., dissenting
the costs of resolving employment disputes and protects thepublic fisc. It is not clear to me that juries would be less

protective of the fisc than would one group of Governmentemployees who deem themselves empowered by agency interpretation to award Government funds to fellow employ-ees. When a Government employee seeks damages from
the Government itself, there may be advantages in insistingupon the expertise of a trial court with experience in awarding damages in all types of cases, with the additional safe-guards of trial in a forum of high visibility, trial by jury if
either party chooses to ask for it, and appellate review.These factors are disregarded by the majority, which seems
instead to suggest that the nature and convenience of admin-istrative proceedings will by necessity provide a financial
advantage to the Government.In all events, speculation does not suffice to overcome the
rule that waivers of sovereign immunity must be clear andexpress. An unequivocal waiver of the United States' sovereign immunity to administrative awards of compensatorydamages cannot be found in the relevant statutory provisions. To the extent the majority relies on textual analysis,it establishes at most (if at all) that the statutes might be
read to authorize such awards, not that the statutes mustbe so read. To the extent the majority relies on legislative
history and other extratextual sources, it contradicts ourprecedents and sets us on a new course, for before today
it was well settled that "[a] statute's legislative history can-not supply a waiver that does not appear clearly in any statutory text." Lane, 518 U. S., at 192; accord, Nordic Village,503 U. S., at 37 ("[T]he `unequivocal expression' of elimination of sovereign immunity that we insist upon is an ex-pression in statutory text. If clarity does not exist there, it
cannot be supplied by a committee report"). With respect,I dissent.

NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINIS-TRATION

et al. v. FEDERAL LABOR RELATIONSAUTHORITY

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eleventh circuit

No. 98-369. Argued March 23, 1999--Decided June 17, 1999
The day after enacting the Inspector General Act (IGA), which created an

Office of Inspector General (OIG) in the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA) and other federal agencies, Congress enacted
the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (FSLMRS),
which, inter alia, permits union participation at an employee examination conducted "by a representative of the agency" if the employee
believes that the examination will result in disciplinary action and
requests such representation, 5 U. S. C. $ 7114(a)(2)(B). When NASA's
OIG (NASA-OIG) began investigating a NASA employee's activities, a
NASA-OIG investigator interviewed the employee and permitted, inter
alios, the employee's union representative to attend. The union subsequently filed a charge with the Federal Labor Relations Authority (Authority), alleging that NASA and its OIG had committed an unfair labor
practice when the investigator limited the union representative's participation in the interview. In ruling for the union, the Administrative
Law Judge concluded that the OIG investigator was a "representative"
of NASA within $ 7114(a)(2)(B)'s meaning, and that the investigator's
behavior had violated the employee's right to union representation. On
review, the Authority agreed and granted relief against both NASA and
NASA-OIG. The Eleventh Circuit granted the Authority's application
for enforcement of its order.

Held: A NASA-OIG investigator is a "representative" of NASA when

conducting an employee examination covered by $ 7114(a)(2)(B).
Pp. 233-246.

(a) Contrary to NASA's and NASA-OIG's argument, ordinary tools
of statutory construction, combined with the Authority's position, lead
to the conclusion that the term "representative" is not limited to a representative of the "entity" that collectively bargains with the employee's
union. By its terms, $ 7114(a)(2)(B) refers simply to representatives
of "the agency," which, all agree, means NASA. The Authority's conclusion is consistent with the FSLMRS and, to the extent the statute
and congressional intent are unclear, the Court may rely on the Authority's reasonable judgment. See, e. g., Federal Employees v. Depart527US1 Unit: $U76 [05-02-01 17:40:56] PAGES PGT: OPLG

ment of Interior, 526 U. S. 86, 98-100. The Court rejects additional
reasons that NASA and NASA-OIG advance for their narrow reading.
Pp. 233-237.

(b) The IGA does not preclude, and in fact favors, treating OIG personnel as representatives of the agencies they are duty-bound to audit
and investigate. The IGA created no central office or officer to supervise, direct, or coordinate the work of all OIG's and their respective
staffs. Other than congressional committees and the President, each
Inspector General has no supervisor other than the head of the agency
of which the OIG is part. Congress certainly intended that the OIGs
would enjoy a great deal of autonomy, but an OIG's investigative office,
as contemplated by the IGA, is performed with regard to, and on behalf
of, the particular agency in which it is stationed. See 5 U. S. C. App.

$$ 2, 4(a), 6(a)(2). Any potentially divergent interests of the OIGs and
their parent agencies--e. g., an OIG has authority to initiate and conduct
investigations and audits without interference from the agency head,

$ 3(a)--do not make NASA-OIG any less a NASA representative when
it investigates a NASA employee. Furthermore, not all OIG examinations subject to $ 7114(a)(2)(B) will implicate an actual or apparent conflict of interest with the rest of the agency; and in many cases honest
cooperation can be expected between an OIG and agency management.
Pp. 237-243.

(c) NASA's and NASA-OIG's additional policy arguments against
applying $ 7114(a)(2)(B) to OIG investigations--that enforcing

$ 7114(a)(2)(B) in situations similar to this case would undermine
NASA-OIG's ability to maintain the confidentiality of investigations,
and that the Authority has construed $ 7114(a)(2)(B) so broadly in other
instances that it will impair NASA-OIG's ability to perform its responsibilities--are ultimately unpersuasive. It is presumed that Congress
took account of the relevant policy concerns when it decided to enact
the IGA and, on that statute's heels, $ 7114(a)(2)(B). Pp. 243-245.

(d) That the investigator in this case was acting as a NASA representative for $ 7114(a)(2)(B) purposes makes it appropriate to charge
NASA-OIG, as well as its parent agency, with responsibility for ensuring that investigations are conducted in compliance with the FSLMRS.

On October 12, 1978, Congress enacted the Inspector Gen-eral Act (IGA), 5 U. S. C. App. $ 1 et seq., p. 1381, which created an Office of Inspector General (OIG) in each of severalfederal agencies, including the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration (NASA). The following day, Con-gress enacted the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (FSLMRS), 5 U. S. C. $ 7101 et seq., which pro-vides certain protections, including union representation, to
a variety of federal employees. The question presentedby this case is whether an investigator employed in NASA's
Office of Inspector General (NASA-OIG) can be considereda "representative" of NASA when examining a NASA employee, such that the right to union representation in theFSLMRS may be invoked. $ 7114(a)(2)(B). Although certain arguments of policy may support a negative answer tothat question, the plain text of the two statutes, buttressed
by administrative deference and Congress' countervailingpolicy concerns, dictates an affirmative answer.

Opinion of the Court
ducted an investigation of certain threatening activities ofan employee of the George C. Marshall Space Flight Center

in Huntsville, Alabama, which is also a component of NASA.A NASA-OIG investigator contacted the employee to arrange for an interview and, in response to the employee's
request, agreed that both the employee's lawyer and unionrepresentative could attend. The conduct of the interview

gave rise to a complaint by the union representative that theinvestigator had improperly limited his participation. The
union filed a charge with the Federal Labor Relations Au-thority (Authority) alleging that NASA and its OIG had
committed an unfair labor practice. See $$ 7116(a)(1), (8).

The Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) ruled for the union
with respect to its complaint against NASA-OIG. See App.
to Pet. for Cert. 71a. The ALJ concluded that the OIG
investigator was a "representative" of NASA within the
meaning of $ 7114(a)(2)(B), and that certain aspects of the
investigator's behavior had violated the right to union representation under that section. Id., at 64a-65a, 69a-70a. On
review, the Authority agreed that the NASA-OIG investigator prevented the union representative from actively participating in the examination and (1) ordered both NASA
and NASA-OIG to cease and desist (a) requiring bargaining
unit employees to participate in OIG interviews under

$ 7114(a)(2)(B) without allowing active participation of a
union representative, and (b) likewise interfering with, coercing, or restraining employees in exercising their rights
under the statute; and (2) directed NASA to (a) order
NASA-OIG to comply with $ 7114(a)(2)(B), and (b) post
appropriate notices at the Huntsville facility. NASA, 50

NASA and NASA-OIG petitioned for review, asking
whether the NASA-OIG investigator was a "representative"
of NASA, and whether it was proper to grant relief against
NASA as well as its OIG. The Court of Appeals upheld the
Authority's rulings on both questions and granted the

The FSLMRS provides, in relevant part,

"(2) An exclusive representative of an appropriateunit in an agency shall be given the opportunity to be

represented at--. . . . .

"(B) any examination of an employee in the unit bya representative of the agency in connection with an
investigation if--"(i) the employee reasonably believes that the examination may result in disciplinary action against the em-ployee; and

"(ii) the employee requests representation. " 5U. S. C. $ 7114(a).

In this case it is undisputed that the employee reasonablybelieved the investigation could result in discipline against
him, that he requested union representation, that NASA isthe relevant "agency," and that, if the provision applies, a
violation of $ 7114(a)(2)(B) occurred. The contested issue iswhether a NASA-OIG investigator can be considered a "representative" of NASA when conducting an employee exami-nation covered by $ 7114(a)(2)(B).

NASA and its OIG argue that, when $ 7114(a)(2)(B) is readin context and compared with the similar right to union representation protected in the private sector by the NationalLabor Relations Act (NLRA), the term "representative"

527US1 Unit: $U76 [05-02-01 17:40:56] PAGES PGT: OPLG
234 NASA v. FLRA

Opinion of the Court
refers only to a representative of agency management--"

i. e., the entity that has a collective bargaining relationship
with the employee's union." Brief for Petitioners 13. Nei-ther NASA nor NASA-OIG has such a relationship with the

employee's union at the Huntsville facility, see 5 U. S. C.

$ 7112(b)(7) (excluding certain agency investigators and audi-tors from "appropriate" bargaining units), and so the investigator in this case could not have been a "representative" ofthe relevant "entity."

By its terms, $ 7114(a)(2)(B) is not limited to investigationsconducted by certain "entit[ies]" within the agency in question. It simply refers to representatives of "the agency,"
which, all agree, means NASA. Cf. $ 7114(a)(2) (referring to
employees "in the unit" and an exclusive representative "of
an appropriate unit in an agency"). Thus, relying on prior
rulings, the Authority found no basis in the FSLMRS or its
legislative history to support the limited reading advocated
by NASA and its OIG. The Authority reasoned that adopting their proposal might erode the right by encouraging the
use of investigative conduits outside the employee's bargaining unit, and would otherwise frustrate Congress' apparent
policy of protecting certain federal employees when they
are examined and justifiably fear disciplinary action. 50
F. L. R. A., at 615, and n. 12. That is, the risk to the employee is not necessarily related to which component of an
agency conducts the examination. See App. to Pet. for Cert.
65a (information obtained by NASA-OIG is referred to
agency officials for administrative or disciplinary action).

In resolving this issue, the Authority was interpreting the
statute Congress directed it to implement and administer.
5 U. S. C. $ 7105. The Authority's conclusion is certainly
consistent with the FSLMRS and, to the extent the statute
and congressional intent are unclear, we may rely on the Authority's reasonable judgment. See Federal Employees v.

Stewart Schools v. FLRA, 495 U. S. 641, 644-645 (1990).

Opinion of the Court
Despite the text of the statute and the Authority's views,NASA and NASA-OIG advance three reasons for their narrow reading. First, the language at issue is contained in alarger section addressing rights and duties related to collective bargaining; indeed, 5 U. S. C. $ 7114 is entitled "Representation rights and duties." Thus, other subsections definethe union's right to exclusive representation of employees in

the bargaining unit, $ 7114(a)(1); its right to participate ingrievance proceedings, $ 7114(a)(2)(A); and its right and duty
to engage in good-faith collective bargaining with the agency,$$ 7114(a)(4), (b). That context helps explain why the right
granted in $ 7114(a)(2)(B) is limited to situations in which the
employee "reasonably believes that the examination may result in disciplinary action"--a condition restricting the right
to union presence or participation in investigatory examinations that do not threaten the witness' employment. We
find nothing in this context, however, suggesting that an examination that obviously presents the risk of employee discipline is nevertheless outside the coverage of the section because it is conducted by an investigator housed in one office
of NASA rather than another. On this point, NASA's internal organization is irrelevant.

Second, the phrase "representative of the agency" is
used in two other places in the FSLMRS where it may refer
to representatives of agency management acting in their
capacity as actual or prospective parties to a collectivebargaining agreement. One reference pertains to grievances, $ 7114(a)(2)(A), and the other to the bargaining process itself, $ 7103(a)(12) (defining "collective bargaining").
NASA and NASA-OIG submit that the phrase at issue
should ordinarily retain the same meaning wherever used in
the same statute, and we agree. But even accepting NASA's
and NASA-OIG's characterization of $$ 7114(a)(2)(A) and
7103(a)(12), the fact that some "representative[s] of the
agency" may perform functions relating to grievances and
bargaining does not mean that other personnel who conduct

527US1 Unit: $U76 [05-02-01 17:40:56] PAGES PGT: OPLG
236 NASA v. FLRA

Opinion of the Court
examinations covered by $ 7114(a)(2)(B) are not also fairlycharacterized as agency "representative[s]." As an organization, an agency must rely on a variety of representativesto carry out its functions and, though acting in different capacities, each may be acting for, and on behalf of, the agency.Third, NASA and NASA-OIG assert that their narrow
construction is supported by the history and purpose of$ 7114(a)(2)(B). As is evident from statements by the author
of the provision 1 as well as similar text in NLRB v. J. Weingarten, Inc., 420 U. S. 251 (1975), this section of the FSLMRSwas patterned after that decision. In Weingarten, we upheld the National Labor Relations Board's conclusion that anemployer's denial of an employee's request to have a union
representative present at an investigatory interview, whichthe employee reasonably believed might result in disciplinary action, was an unfair labor practice. Id., at 252-253,256. We reasoned that the Board's position was consistent
with the employee's right under $ 7 of the NLRA to engagein concerted activities.

Id., at 260. Given that history,NASA and its OIG contend that the comparable provision in

the FSLMRS should be limited to investigations by repre-sentatives of that part of agency management with responsibility for collectively bargaining with the employee's union.This argument ignores the important difference between
the text of the NLRA and the text of the FSLMRS. Thatthe general protection afforded to employees by $ 7 of the
NLRA provided a sufficient basis for the Board's recognitionof a novel right in the private sector, see

id., at 260-262,

Opinion of the Court
266-267, does not justify the conclusion that the text of the
FSLMRS--which expressly grants a comparable right to
employees in the public sector--should be narrowly construed to cover some, but not all, interviews conducted by
agency representatives that have a disciplinary potential.
Congress' specific endorsement of a Government employee's
right to union representation by incorporating it in the text
of the FSLMRS gives that right a different foundation than
if it were merely the product of an agency's attempt to elaborate on a more general provision in light of broad statutory
purposes.2 The basis for the right to union representation
in this context cannot compel the uncodified limitation proposed by NASA and its OIG.

Employing ordinary tools of statutory construction, in
combination with the Authority's position on the matter, we
have no difficulty concluding that $ 7114(a)(2)(B) is not limited to agency investigators representing an "entity" that
collectively bargains with the employee's union.

III
Much of the disagreement in this case involves the interplay between the FSLMRS and the IGA. On NASA's and
NASA-OIG's view, a proper understanding of the IGA precludes treating OIG personnel as "representative[s]" of the
agencies they are duty-bound to audit and investigate.
They add that the Authority has no congressional mandate
or expertise with respect to the IGA, and thus we owe the
Authority no deference on this score. It is unnecessary for
us to defer, however, because a careful review of the relevant
IGA provisions plainly favors the Authority's position.

Opinion of the Court
Section 2 of the IGA explains the purpose of the Act andestablishes "an office of Inspector General" in each of a list

of identified federal agencies, thereby consolidating audit andinvestigation responsibilities into one agency component.
It provides:

"In order to create independent and objective units--"(1) to conduct and supervise audits and investigations relating to the programs and operations of theestablishments listed in section 11(2);

"(2) to provide leadership and coordination and rec-ommend policies for activities designed (A) to promote
economy, efficiency, and effectiveness in the administra-tion of, and (B) to prevent and detect fraud and abuse
in, such programs and operations; and"(3) to provide a means for keeping the head of the
establishment and the Congress fully and currently in-formed about problems and deficiencies relating to the
administration of such programs and operations and thenecessity for and progress of corrective action;

below such head," but shall not be subject to supervision by
any lesser officer. Ibid. Moreover, an Inspector General'sseniors within the agency may not "prevent or prohibit" the

Inspector General from initiating or conducting any audit orinvestigation.

Ibid.; see also $ 6(a)(2). The President retains the power to remove an Inspector General from office.$ 3(b).

Section 4 contains a detailed description of the duties of
each Inspector General with respect to the agency "within
which his Office is established." $ 4(a). Those duties include conducting audits and investigations, recommending
new policies, reviewing legislation, and keeping the head
of the agency and the Congress "fully and currently informed" through such means as detailed, semiannual reports.

$$ 4(a)(1)-(5). Pursuant to $ 5, those reports must be furnished to the head of the agency, who, in turn, must forward
them to the appropriate committee or subcommittee of Congress with such comment as the agency head deems appropriate. $ 5(b)(1); see also $ 5(d). Section 6 grants the Inspectors General specific authority in a variety of areas to
facilitate the mission of their offices. Accordingly, Inspectors General possess discretion to conduct investigations "relating to the administration of the programs and operations
of the applicable" agency, $ 6(a)(2); the ability to request
information and assistance from Government agencies,

power to hire employees, enter into contracts, and spend
congressionally appropriated funds, $$ 6(a)(7), (9); see also

$ 3(d). Finally, $ 9(a)(1)(P) provides for the transfer of the
functions previously performed by NASA's " `Management
Audit Office' and the `Office of Inspections and Security' "
to NASA-OIG.

240 NASA v. FLRA

Opinion of the Court
The IGA created no central office or officer to supervise,direct, or coordinate the work of all OIG's and their respective staffs. Other than congressional committees (which arethe recipients of the reports prepared by each Inspector
General) and the President (who has the power to remove anInspector General), each Inspector General has no supervising authority--except the head of the agency of which theOIG is a part. There is no "OIG-OIG." Thus, for example,
NASA-OIG maintains an office at NASA's Huntsville facil-ity, which reports to NASA-OIG in Washington, and then
to the NASA Administrator, who is the head of the agency.

$ 11(1); 50 F. L. R. A., at 602.4 In conducting their work,Congress certainly intended that the various OIG's would

enjoy a great deal of autonomy. But unlike the jurisdictionof many law enforcement agencies, an OIG's investigative office, as contemplated by the IGA, is performed with regard
to, and on behalf of, the particular agency in which it is sta-tioned. See 5 U. S. C. App. $$ 2, 4(a), 6(a)(2). In common

parlance, the investigators employed in NASA's OIG are un-questionably "representatives" of NASA when acting within
the scope of their employment.Minimizing the significance of this statutory plan, NASA
and NASA-OIG emphasize the potentially divergent inter-ests of the OIG's and their parent agencies. To be sure,
OIG's maintain authority to initiate and conduct investigations and audits without interference from the head of theagency. $ 3(a). And the ability to proceed without consent

from agency higher-ups is vital to effectuating Congress' in-tent and maintaining an opportunity for objective inquiries
into bureaucratic waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement.5

4 At oral argument, NASA and NASA-OIG indicated that the Administrator's general supervision authority includes the ability to require its
Inspector General to comply with, inter alia, equal employment opportunity regulations. Tr. of Oral Arg. 5.

241Cite as: 527 U. S. 229 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
But those characteristics do not make NASA-OIG any less
a representative of NASA when it investigates a NASA employee. That certain officials within an agency, based on
their views of the agency's best interests or their own, might
oppose an OIG investigation does not tell us whether the
investigators are "representatives" of the agency during the
course of their duties. As far as the IGA is concerned,
NASA-OIG's investigators are employed by, act on behalf of,
and operate for the benefit of NASA.

Furthermore, NASA and NASA-OIG overstate the inherent conflict between an OIG and its agency. The investigation in this case was initiated by NASA's OIG on the basis
of information provided by the FBI, but nothing in the IGA
indicates that, if the information had been supplied by the
Administrator of NASA rather than the FBI, NASA-OIG
would have had any lesser obligation to pursue an investigation. See $$ 4(a)(1), (d), 7; S. Rep. No. 95-1071, p. 26 (1978).
The statute does not suggest that one can determine
whether the OIG personnel engaged in such an investigation
are "representatives" of NASA based on the source of the
information prompting an investigation. Therefore, it must
be NASA's and NASA-OIG's position that even when an
OIG conducts an investigation in response to a specific request from the head of an agency, an employee engaged in
that assignment is not a "representative" of the agency
within the meaning of $ 7114(a)(2)(B) of the FSLMRS. Such
management-prompted investigations are not rare.6

242 NASA v. FLRA

Opinion of the Court
Thus, not all OIG examinations subject to $ 7114(a)(2)(B)will implicate an actual or apparent conflict of interest with

the rest of the agency; and in many cases we can expecthonest cooperation between an OIG and management-level
agency personnel. That conclusion becomes more obviouswhen the practical operation of OIG interviews and

$ 7114(a)(2)(B) rights are considered. The IGA grants In-spectors General the authority to subpoena documents and
information, but not witnesses. 5 U. S. C. App. $ 6(a)(4).Nor does the IGA allow an OIG to discipline an agency employee, as all parties to this case agree. There may be otherincentives for employee cooperation with OIG investigations,
but formal sanctions for refusing to submit to an OIG inter-view cannot be pursued by the OIG alone. Such limitations
on OIG authority enhance the likelihood and importance ofcooperation between the agency and its OIG. See generally

$$ 6(a)(3), (b)(1)-(2) (addressing an Inspector General's au-thority to request assistance from others in the agency, and
their duty to respond); $$ 4(a)(5), (d); 50 F. L. R. A., at 616;
App. to Pet. for Cert. 65a (noting information sharing be-tween NASA-OIG and other agency officials). Thus, if the

NASA-OIG investigator in this case told the employee thathe would face dismissal if he refused to answer questions,
120 F. 3d, at 1210, n. 2, the investigator invoked NASA's au-thority, not his own.

7

7 In fact, a violation of $ 7114(a)(2)(B) seems less likely to occur when
the agency and its OIG are not acting in concert. Under the Authority's
construction of the FSLMRS, when an employee within the unit makes a
valid request for union representation, an OIG investigator does not commit an unfair labor practice by (1) halting the examination, or (2) offering
the employee a choice between proceeding without representation and discontinuing the examination altogether. United States Dept. of Justice,
Bureau of Prisons, 27 F. L. R. A. 874, 879-880 (1987); see also NLRB v.
J. Weingarten, Inc., 420 U. S. 251, 258-260 (1975). Disciplining an employee for his or her choice to demand union participation or to discontinue
an examination would presumably violate the statute, but such responses
require more authority than Congress granted the OIG's in the IGA.

243Cite as: 527 U. S. 229 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
Considering NASA-OIG's statutorily defined role within
the agency, we cannot conclude that the proper operation of
the IGA requires nullification of $ 7114(a)(2)(B) in all OIG
examinations.

IV

Although NASA's and NASA-OIG's narrow reading of
the phrase "representative of the agency" is supported by
the text of neither the FSLMRS nor the IGA, they also
present broader--but ultimately unpersuasive--arguments
of policy to defeat the application of $ 7114(a)(2)(B) to OIG
investigations.

First, NASA and NASA-OIG contend that enforcing

$ 7114(a)(2)(B) in situations similar to this case would undermine NASA-OIG's ability to maintain the confidentiality of
investigations, particularly those investigations conducted
jointly with law enforcement agencies. Cf. 5 U. S. C. App.

$$ 5(e)(1)(C), (e)(2) (restricting OIG disclosure of information
that is part of an ongoing criminal investigation). NASA
and its OIG are no doubt correct in suggesting that the presence of a union representative at an examination will increase the likelihood that its contents will be disclosed to
third parties. That possibility is, however, always present:
NASA and NASA-OIG identify no legal authority restricting an employee's ability to discuss the matter with others.
Furthermore, an employee cannot demand the attendance of
a union representative when an OIG examination does not
involve reasonably apparent potential discipline for that employee. Interviewing an employee who may have information relating to agency maladministration, but who is not
himself under suspicion, ordinarily will not trigger the right
to union representation. Thus, a variety of OIG investigations and interviews--and many in which confidentiality concerns are heightened--will not implicate $ 7114(a)(2)(B)
at all. Though legitimate, NASA's and NASA-OIG's confidentiality concerns are not weighty enough to justify a

527US1 Unit: $U76 [05-02-01 17:40:56] PAGES PGT: OPLG
244 NASA v. FLRA

Opinion of the Court
nontextual construction of $ 7114(a)(2)(B) rejected by theAuthority.

Second, NASA and its OIG submit that, in other instances,the Authority has construed $ 7114(a)(2)(B) so broadly that it
will impair NASA-OIG's ability to perform its investigatoryresponsibilities. The Authority responds that it has been
sensitive to agencies' investigative needs in other cases, andthat union representation is unrelated to OIG independence
from agency interference. Whatever the propriety of theAuthority's rulings in other cases, NASA and NASA-OIG
elected not to challenge the Authority's conclusion that theNASA-OIG examiner's attempt to limit union representative participation constituted an unfair labor practice. Toresolve the question presented in this case, we need not
agree or disagree with the Authority's various rulings re-garding the scope of $ 7114(a)(2)(B), nor must we consider
whether the outer limits of the Authority's interpretationso obstruct the performance of an OIG's statutory responsibilities that the right must be more confined in thiscontext.

8

In any event, the right Congress created in $ 7114(a)(2)(B)vindicates obvious countervailing federal policies. It provides a procedural safeguard for employees who are underinvestigation by their agency, and the mere existence of the
right can only strengthen the morale of the federal workforce. The interest in fair treatment for employees under

8 The same can be said of NASA's and NASA-OIG's concerns that the
reach of $ 7114(a)(2)(B) will become the subject of collective bargaining

enforcement officials with a broader charge, present distinct questions not

Opinion of the Court
investigation is equally strong whether they are being ques-tioned by employees in NASA's OIG or by other representatives of the agency. And, as we indicated in Weingarten,representation is not the equivalent of obstruction. See 420
U. S., at 262-264. In many cases the participation of a unionrepresentative will facilitate the factfinding process and a
fair resolution of an agency investigation--or at least Con-gress must have thought so.

Whenever a procedural protection plays a meaningful rolein an investigation, it may impose some burden on the investigators or agency managers in pursuing their mission. Wemust presume, however, that Congress took account of the
policy concerns on both sides of the balance when it decidedto enact the IGA and, on the heels of that statute,

$ 7114(a)(2)(B).9

9 The dissent does not dispute much of our analysis; it indicates that
NASA-OIG is an "ar[m]" of NASA "work[ing] to promote overall agency
concerns." Post, at 260. The dissent's premise is that the Authority determined that the phrase "representative of the agency" means "representative of . . . agency [management]," and that this issue is now uncontested. See post, at 246-247, 248-259, 262. But see post, at 251, n. 3.
Putting aside the fact that NASA's and NASA-OIG's construction of the
statute--however one interprets their argument--is very much in dispute,
see Brief for Respondent American Federation of Government Employees,
AFL-CIO 26-32; Brief for Respondent FLRA 23-25, 31, and the rule that
litigants cannot bind us to an erroneous interpretation of federal legislation, see Roberts v. Galen of Va., Inc., 525 U. S. 249, 253 (1999), we have
ignored neither the actual rationale of the Authority's decision in this case
nor NASA's and NASA-OIG's arguments before this Court. Focusing on
its plain reasoning, we cannot fairly read the Authority's decision as turning on whether NASA "management" was involved. The Authority emphasized that FSLMRS rights do not depend on "the organizational entity
within the agency to whom the person conducting the examination reports"; and in discussing NASA-OIG's role within the agency, the Authority's decision repeatedly refers to NASA headquarters together with its
components--that is, to the agency as a whole. 50 F. L. R. A., at 615-616;

Finally, NASA argues that it was error for the Authorityto make NASA itself, as well as NASA's OIG, a party to the

enforcement order because NASA has no authority over themanner in which NASA-OIG conducts its investigations.
However, our conclusion that the investigator in this casewas acting as a "representative" of NASA for purposes of

$ 7114(a)(2)(B) makes it appropriate to charge NASA-OIG,as well as the parent agency to which it reports and for
which it acts, with responsibility for ensuring that such in-vestigations are conducted in compliance with the FSLMRS.
NASA's Administrator retains general supervisory authorityover NASA's OIG, 5 U. S. C. App. $ 3(a), and the remedy imposed by the Authority does not require NASA to interfereunduly with OIG prerogatives. NASA and NASA-OIG
offer no convincing reason to believe that the Authority'sremedy is inappropriate in view of the IGA, or that it will
be ineffective in protecting the limited right of unionrepresentation secured by $ 7114(a)(2)(B). See generally 5
U. S. C. $$ 706, 7123(c).The judgment of the Court of Appeals is

Affirmed.

In light of the independence guaranteed Inspectors Gen-eral by the Inspector General Act of 1978, 5 U. S. C. App. $ 1

as "agency management's agent," a term coined by the dissent. Post,

I
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration isheadquartered in Washington, D. C. Among other agency

subcomponents are the George C. Marshall Space FlightCenter (Marshall Center), located in Huntsville, Alabama,
and the Office of Inspector General, which is headquartered
in Washington, D. C., but maintains offices in all of theagency's other subcomponents, including the Marshall Center. In January 1993, the Federal Bureau of Investigationreceived information that an employee of the Marshall Center, who is referred to in the record only as "P," was sus-pected of spying upon and threatening various co-workers.
The FBI referred the matter directly to NASA's OIG, andan investigator for that Office who was stationed at the Marshall Center was assigned the case. He contacted P, who
agreed to be interviewed so long as his attorney and a unionrepresentative were present; the investigator accepted P's

conditions. App. to Pet. for Cert. 61a. At the interview,OIG's investigator read certain ground rules, which provided, inter alia, that the union representative was " `not to
interrupt the question and answer process.' " Ibid.1 The
union filed an unfair labor practice charge, claiming that the
interview was not conducted in accordance with the requirements of 5 U. S. C. $ 7114(a)(2)(B), as the Authority has interpreted that provision. The Authority's General Counsel issued a complaint to that effect, and the Authority found that

NASA headquarters and NASA's OIG had committed unfairlabor practices. On review, the Court of Appeals for the

Eleventh Circuit granted the Authority's application for en-forcement of its order. 120 F. 3d 1208 (1997).

As the Court correctly recognizes, ante, at 233, several
points are not in dispute at this stage of the litigation. Thefact that P requested union representation and reasonably

believed that disciplinary action might be taken against himon the basis of information developed during the examination has never been in dispute in this case. See NASA, 50F. L. R. A. 601, 606, n. 4 (1995). Although petitioners contested the matter before the Authority, on review in the
Eleventh Circuit, they conceded that OIG's investigator conducted the interview of P in a way that did not comport with
what $ 7114(a)(2)(B) requires. See 120 F. 3d, at 1211. And
all parties agree that the relevant "agency" for purposes of

$ 7114(a)(2)(B) is NASA. One other point is not disputed--
the "representative" to which $ 7114(a)(2)(B) refers must
represent agency management, not just the agency in some
general sense as the Court suggests, ante, at 233-234, 240.
See 50 F. L. R. A., at 614 (" `[R]epresentative of the agency'

Thomas, J., dissenting
Since an agency's stated reasons for decision are important
in any case reviewing agency action, I summarize in some
detail what the Authority actually said in this case. It
began by stating its conclusion:

"We reach this conclusion based upon our determination
that: (1) the term `representative of the agency' under
section 7114(a)(2)(B) should not be so narrowly construed as to exclude management personnel employed
in other subcomponents of the agency; (2) the statutory
independence of agency OIGs is not determinative of
whether the investigatory interviews implicate section
7114(a)(2)(B) rights; and (3) section 7114(a)(2)(B) and
the IG Act are not irreconcilable." 50 F. L. R. A., at
614.

The Authority headed its discussion of its first determination "Section 7114(a)(2)(B) Covers the Actions of Management Personnel Employed in Other Subcomponents of the
Agency." Id., at 615. This statement appears to suggest
OIG itself is part of agency management. But the remainder of the Authority's discussion appears to advance a different theory--one that OIG serves as agency management's
agent because OIG inspectors ultimately report to NASA's
Administrator, see ibid. (OIG's investigator, "although employed in a separate component from the MSFC, is an employee of and ultimately reports to the head of NASA"), and
because OIG provides information to management that
sometimes results in discipline to union employees, ibid.
("OIG not only provides investigatory information to NASA
[headquarters] but also to other NASA subcomponent offices"); see also id., at 616 (Congress would regard an OIG
investigator as a representative of the agency because "[t]he
information obtained during the course of an OIG investigatory examination may be released to, and used by, other
subcomponents of NASA to support administrative or disci527US1 Unit: $U76 [05-02-01 17:40:57] PAGES PGT: OPLG

plinary actions taken against unit employees").2 The Authority recognized that the Inspector General Act grants an
Inspector General, or IG, "a degree of freedom and independence from the parent agency." Id., at 615. It thought, however, that the Inspector General's autonomy "becomes nonexistent" when the IG's investigation concerns allegations of
misconduct by agency employees in connection with their
work and the information obtained during the investigation
possibly would be shared with agency management. Ibid.
As it further explained: "[I]n some circumstances, NASA,
OIG performs an investigatory role for NASA [headquarters] and its subcomponents, specifically [the Marshall Center]." Id., at 616 (emphasis added). Moreover, the Authority reasoned, the Inspector General "plays an integral role
in assisting the agency and its subcomponent offices in meeting the agency's objectives." Id., at 617. In light of all this,
the Authority concluded:

"Plainly, the IG represents and safeguards the entire
agency's interests when it investigates the actions of the
agency's employees. Such activities support, rather
than threaten, broader agency interests and make the
IG a participant, with other agency components, in
meeting various statutory obligations, including the
agency's labor relations obligations under the Statute."
Ibid.

2 The Authority also relied on a policy ground here. It asserted that
there was "no basis in the Statute or its legislative history to make the
existence of [the representational rights provided by $ 7114] dependent
upon the organizational entity within the agency to whom the person conducting the examination reports." 50 F. L. R. A., at 615. It elaborated,
in a footnote, that "[i]f such were the case, agencies could abridge bargaining unit rights and evade statutory responsibilities under section
7114(a)(2)(B), and thus thwart the intent of Congress, by utilizing personnel from other subcomponents (such as the OIG) to conduct investigative
interviews of bargaining unit employees." Id., at 615, n. 12.

The Authority's recognition that $ 7114(a)(2)(B) protec-tions are only triggered when an investigation is conducted

by, or on behalf of, agency management, is important andhardly surprising. See,

e. g., 50 F. L. R. A., at 614 ("section7114(a)(2)(B) should not be so narrowly construed as to exclude management personnel employed in other subcompo-nents of the agency" (emphasis added)); Brief for Respondent
FLRA 21 ("The Authority's conclusion that the word `repre-sentative,' or phrase `representative of the agency,' includes
management personnel in other subcomponents of the`agency' is entirely consistent with the language of the [Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute]" (empha-sis added)). It is important because the Court seems to
think it enough that NASA's OIG represent NASA in somebroad and general sense. But as the Authority's own opinion makes clear, that is not enough--NASA's OIG must rep-resent NASA's management to qualify as a "representative
of the agency" within the meaning of $ 7114(a)(2)(B). TheAuthority's position is hardly surprising in that the Federal
Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (FSLMRS)plainly means just that.

3 The FSLMRS governs labormanagement relations in the federal sector. Section7114(a)(2)(B) is captioned "[r]epresentation rights and duties," and every employee right contained therein flows fromthe collective-bargaining relationship.

4 As petitioners note,

3 Although it is significant that the Authority recognized below and recognizes here that the statutory phrase "representative of the agency" refers to a representative of agency management, I do not, as the Court
asserts, ante, at 245-246, n. 9, rest the argument on the premise that the
point is conceded. Rather, in light of the context in which the phrase
appears, and in light of the very subject matter of the statute, the phrase
plainly has that meaning.

4 Section 7114(a)(1) details what "[a] labor organization which has been

accorded exclusive recognition" is entitled to and must do; $ 7114(a)(2) indicates when an exclusive representative may be present at discussions or
examinations conducted by agency management; $ 7114(a)(3) requires

in each of the three instances where the FSLMRS refers toan agency representative, it does so in the context of the

collective-bargaining relationship between management andlabor. See $$ 7103(a)(12), 7114(a)(2)(A), 7114(a)(2)(B).

Investigators within NASA's OIG might be "representa-tives of the agency" in two ways. First, if NASA's Inspector General and NASA's OIG itself were part of agency man-agement, I suppose that employees of the Office necessarily
would be representatives of agency management. But, tothe extent that the Authority meant to hold that, there is no

agency management annually to inform its employees of their rights under

$ 7114(a)(2)(B); $ 7114(a)(4) obligates management and the exclusive representative to bargain in good faith for purposes of arriving at a collectivebargaining agreement; $ 7114(a)(5) provides that the rights of an exclusive
representative do not limit an employee's right to seek other representation, for example, legal counsel; $ 7114(b) speaks to the duty of good
faith imposed on management and the exclusive representative under

$ 7114(a)(4); and $ 7114(c) requires the head of the agency to approve all
collective-bargaining agreements.

5 I disagree with the Court as to the proper reading of petitioners' argument that the phrase "representative of the agency" refers only to the
entity that has a collective-bargaining relationship with a union. I do not
take petitioners to mean that OIG's representative did not represent the
"agency," NASA, for the simple reason that only Space Center management had a collective-bargaining relationship with P's union. If that were
truly petitioners' view, its later argument that OIG cannot represent
NASA because the IG is substantially independent from the agency head
would not make sense--it would be enough for petitioners to argue that
OIG is not under the control of the Marshall Center's management.
Rather, as petitioners make clear in their reply brief, they are simply
arguing that "a `representative of the agency' must be a representative of
agency management, as opposed to just another employee." Reply Brief
for Petitioners 2, and n. 4. It appears that they would agree, in accordance with the Authority's precedent, see, e. g., Air Force Logistics Command, 46 F. L. R. A. 1184, 1186 (1993); Department of Health and Human
Services, 39 F. L. R. A. 298, 311-312 (1991), that NASA headquarters
also qualifies as agency management under the FSLMRS, even though
it lacks a direct collective-bargaining relationship with a union, because it
directs its subordinate managers who have such a collective-bargaining
relationship.

basis for its conclusion. OIG has no authority over personsemployed within the agency outside of its Office and similarly has no authority to direct agency personnel outside ofthe Office. Inspectors General, moreover, have no authority
under the Inspector General Act to punish agency employees, to take corrective action with respect to agency pro-grams, or to implement any reforms in agency programs that

they might recommend on their own. See generally Inspector General Authority to Conduct Regulatory Investigations, 13 Op. Off. Legal Counsel 54, 55 (1989); CongressionalResearch Service, Report for Congress, Statutory Offices of

Inspector General: A 20th Anniversary Review 7 (Nov. 1998).
The Inspector General is charged with, inter alia, investigating suspected waste, fraud, and abuse, see 5 U. S. C. App.

$$ 2, 4, 6, and making policy recommendations (which the
agency head is not obliged to accept), see $$ 4(a)(3), (4), but
the Inspector General Act bars the Inspector General from
participating in the performance of agency management
functions, see $ 9(a). Moreover, OIG is not permitted to be
party to a collective-bargaining relationship. See 5 U. S. C.

$ 7112(b)(7) (prohibiting "any employee primarily engaged
in investigation or audit functions" from participating in a
bargaining unit).

Investigators within NASA's OIG might "represent" the
agency if they acted as agency management's representative--essentially, if OIG was agency management's agent or
somehow derived its authority from agency management
when investigating union employees. And something akin
to an agency theory appears to be the primary basis for the
Authority's decision. The agency theory does have a textual
basis--$ 7114(a)(2)(B)'s term "representative," as is relevant
in this context, can mean "standing for or in the place of
another: acting for another or others: constituting the agent
for another esp[ecially] through delegated authority," or "one
that represents another as agent, deputy, substitute, or delegate usu[ally] being invested with the authority of the princi527US1 Unit: $U76 [05-02-01 17:40:57] PAGES PGT: OPLG

2114 (2d ed. 1957) ("[b]eing, or acting as, the agent for an-other, esp. through delegated authority"). The agency notion, though, is counterintuitive, given that, as the majorityacknowledges,

ante, at 238, the stated purpose of the Inspec-tor General Act was to establish "independent and objective

units" within agencies to conduct audits and investigations,see 5 U. S. C. App. $ 2 (emphasis added).

To be sure, NASA's OIG is a subcomponent of NASA andthe Inspector General is subject to the "general supervision," $ 3(a), of NASA's Administrator (or of the "officer nextin rank below" the Administrator,

ibid.).6 But, as theFourth Circuit has observed, it is hard to see how this "general supervision" amounts to much more than "nominal" su-pervision. See

NRC v. FLRA, 25 F. 3d 229, 235 (1994).NASA's Inspector General does not depend upon the Administrator's approval to obtain or to keep her job. NASA's In-spector General must be appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, "without regard to political affiliationand solely on the basis of integrity and demonstrated ability in accounting, auditing, financial analysis, law, manage-ment analysis, public administration, or investigations." 5
U. S. C. App. $ 3(a). Only the President, and not NASA'sAdministrator, may remove the Inspector General, and even
then the President must provide Congress with his reasonsfor doing so. $ 3(b).

subject to supervision by," any other agency officer. 5 U. S. C. App. $ 3(a).

to Inspector General supervision. We were told at oral argument that
Executive Order 12993, 3 CFR 171 (1996), governs the procedures to be
followed in those instances where the Inspector General and NASA's Administrator are in conflict. Tr. of Oral Arg. 51-52. Complaints against

control over who works for the Inspector General. Inspec-tors General have the authority to appoint an Assistant Inspector General for Auditing and another Assistant Inspec-tor General for Investigations, $$ 3(d)(1), (2), may "select,
appoint, and employ such officers and employees as may be
necessary," $ 6(a)(7), and also are authorized to employ ex-perts and consultants and enter into contracts for audits,

studies, and other necessary services, see $$ 6(a)(8), (9); seegenerally P. Light, Monitoring Government: Inspectors General and the Search for Accountability 175-185 (1993) (de-scribing the "unprecedented freedom" that IG's have under
the Inspector General Act in organizing their offices and howIG's have enhanced their independence by exercising their
statutory authority in this regard to the fullest).

Inspectors General do not derive their authority toconduct audits and investigate agency affairs from agency

management. They are authorized to do so directly under
the Inspector General Act. 5 U. S. C. App. $ 2(1). Neither
NASA's Administrator, nor any other agency official, may
"prevent or prohibit the Inspector General from initiating,
carrying out, or completing any audit or investigation, or
from issuing any subpoena during the course of any audit
or investigation." $ 3(a). The Administrator also may not
direct the Inspector General to undertake a particular investigation; the Inspector General Act commits to the IG's discretion the decision whether to investigate or report upon
the agency's programs and operations. $ 6(a)(2). The Authority's counsel argued to the contrary, but could not provide a single example of an instance where an agency head

has directed an Inspector General to conduct an investiga-tion in a particular manner. Tr. of Oral Arg. 40, see also

id., at 46-48 (counsel for respondent American Federation ofGovernment Employees (AFGE) also unable to provide an
example of agency head direction of OIG investigation).The Authority's counsel also could not support his assertion
that agency heads have the power to direct the InspectorGeneral to comply with laws such as the FSLMRS.

Id., at41-43.

Inspectors General, furthermore, are provided a broadrange of investigatory powers under the Act. They are
given access to "all records, reports, audits, reviews, docu-ments, papers, recommendations, or other material" of the
agency. 5 U. S. C. App. $ 6(a)(1). They may issue subpoe-nas to obtain such information if necessary, and any such
subpoena is enforceable by an appropriate United States dis-trict court. $ 6(a)(4).

8 The Inspector General also may "administer to or take from any person an oath, affirmation, oraffidavit, whenever necessary." $ 6(a)(5). Inspectors General do not have the statutory authority to compel an em-ployee's attendance at an interview. But if an employee
refuses to attend an interview voluntarily, the InspectorGeneral may request assistance, $ 6(a)(3), and the agency
head "shall . . . furnish . . . information or assistance" toOIG, $ 6(b)(1).

NASA's Inspector General does, as the Authority claimed,provide information developed in the course of her audits
and investigations to the Administrator. $$ 2(3), 4(a)(5).But she has outside reporting obligations as well.

the Administrator may not prevent the report from going toCongress and may not change or order the Inspector General

to change his report. Moreover, the Inspector General mustnotify the Attorney General directly,

without notice to other
agency officials, upon discovery of "reasonable grounds to
believe there has been a violation of Federal criminal law."$ 4(d).

As a practical matter, the Inspector General's independ-ence from agency management is understood by Members of
Congress and Executive Branch officials alike. This under-standing was on display at the recent congressional hearing
on the occasion of the Inspector General Act's 20th anniversary. For example, Senator Thompson, Chairman of the
Senate Government Affairs Committee, stated that "[t]he
overarching question we need to explore is whether the Executive Branch is providing IGs with support and attention
adequate to ensure their independence and effectiveness."
Hearings on "The Inspector General Act: 20 Years Later"
before the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs,
105th Cong., 2d Sess., 2 (1998). He further explained that
"[t]he IGs . . . are paid to give [Congress] an independent and
objective version [of] events." Ibid. Senator Glenn, then
the ranking minority member, opined that "the IG's first responsibility continues to be program and fiscal integrity;
they are not `tools' of management." Id., at 7.

At those hearings, testimony was received from several
Inspectors General. June Gibbs Brown, the Inspector General for the United States Department of Health and Human
Services, praised Secretary Shalala for "never, not even
once, [seeking] to encroach on [her] independence." Id., at
4. In her written testimony, she offered: "A key component
of OIG independence is our direct communication with the
Members and staff of the Congress. Frankly, I suspect that
no agency head relishes the fact that IGs have, by law, an
independent relationship with oversight Committees. Information can and must go directly from the Inspectors Gen527US1 Unit: $U76 [05-02-01 17:40:57] PAGES PGT: OPLG

eral to the Hill, without prior agency and administrationclearance."

Id., at 45. The testimony of Susan Gaffney, the
Inspector General for the United States Department ofHousing and Urban Development, revealed that agency managers know all too well that the Inspector General is independent of agency management:

hostile attitude toward the independence of the HUDOIG, and, as I have detailed in my written testimony, he
has, in fact, let this hostility lead to a series of attacks
and dirty tricks against the HUD OIG." Id., at 6.

In her written testimony, Ms. Gaffney further explained that,while, "[i]deally, the relationship between an IG and the

agency head is characterized by mutual respect, a common
commitment to the agency mission, and a thorough under-standing and acceptance of the vastly different roles of the

IG and the agency head," the current Secretary, in her view,was "uncomfortable with the concept of an independent Inspector General who is not subject to his control and whohas a dual reporting responsibility."

Id., at 48-49.
The Authority essentially provided four reasons why OIGrepresented agency management in this case: because OIG

is a subcomponent of NASA and subject to the "general supervision" of its Administrator; because it provides infor-mation obtained during the course of its investigations to

NASA headquarters and its subcomponents; because that in-formation is sometimes used for administrative and disciplinary purposes; and because OIG's functions support broader
agency objectives. In my view, the fact that OIG is housed
in the agency and subject to supervision (an example of
which neither the Authority nor the Court can provide) is an
insufficient basis upon which to rest the conclusion that OIG's
employees are "representatives" of agency management. It
is hard to see how OIG serves as agency management's agent

or representative when the Inspector General is given thediscretion to decide whether, when, and how to conduct investigations. See 5 U. S. C. App. $$ 3(a), 6(a).9The fact that information obtained in the course of OIG
interviews is shared with agency management and some-times forms the basis for employee discipline is similarly unimpressive. The Court suggests that when this happens,OIG and agency management act in "concert."

Ante, at242, n. 7. The truth of the matter is that upon receipt of

information from OIG, agency management has the discre-tion to impose discipline but it need not do so. And OIG
has no determinative role in agency management's decision.See 5 U. S. C. App. $ 9(a) (Inspector General may not participate in the performance of agency management functions).Although OIG may provide information developed in the
course of an investigation to agency management, so, appar-ently, does the FBI, the DEA, and local police departments.
See, e. g., 63 Fed. Reg. 8682 (1998) (FBI's disclosure policy);62 Fed. Reg. 36572 (1997) (Immigration and Naturalization
Service (INS) Alien File and Central Index System); 62 Fed.Reg. 26555 (1997) (INS Law Enforcement Support Center

9 The Court posits, ante, at 241, that "nothing in the [Inspector General
Act] indicates that, if the information had been supplied by the Administrator of NASA rather than the FBI, NASA-OIG would have had any
lesser obligation to pursue an investigation." It appears shocked at the
proposition that petitioners might think that "even when an OIG conducts
an investigation in response to a specific request from the head of an
agency, an employee engaged in that assignment is not a `representative'
of the agency within the meaning of [5 U. S. C.] $ 7114(a)(2)(B)." Ibid.
The answer to the Court is quite simple. So far as the Inspector General
Act reveals, OIG has no obligation to pursue any particular investigation.
And presumably the Court would agree that if NASA's Administrator
referred a matter to the FBI or the Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA) (who also, we are told, rely on agency management to compel an
employee's appearance at an interview, Reply Brief for Petitioners 5-6),
those independent agencies would not "represent" the agency. I fail to
see how it is different when the investigatory unit, although independent
from agency management, is housed within the agency.

Database); 61 Fed. Reg. 54219 (1996) (DEA); 60 Fed. Reg.56648 (1995) (Secret Service, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and

Firearms, and other Treasury components); 60 Fed. Reg.18853 (1995) (United States Marshals Service (USMS)); 54
Fed. Reg. 42060 (1989) (FBI, USMS, and various Department of Justice record systems); see also 31 CFR $ 1.36(1998) (listing routine uses and other exemptions in disclosure of Treasury agencies' records). Surely it would not bereasonable to consider an FBI agent to be a "representative"
of agency management just because information developedin the course of his investigation of a union employee may
be provided to agency management. Merely providing information does not establish an agency relationship between
management and the provider.

Similarly, the fact that OIG may promote broader agency
objectives does not mean that it acts as management's agent.
To be sure, as the Court points out, ante, at 240, OIG's mission is to conduct audits and investigations of the agency's
programs and operations. See 5 U. S. C. App. $$ 2, 4(a).
But just because two arms of the same agency work to promote overall agency concerns does not make one the other's
representative. In any event, OIG serves more than just
agency concerns. It also provides the separate function of
keeping Congress aware of agency developments, a function
that is of substantial assistance to the congressional oversight function.

The Court mentions, ante, at 242, that the Inspector General lacks the authority to compel witnesses to appear at
an interview as if that provided support for the Authority's
decision. Perhaps it is of the view that because the Inspector General must rely upon the agency head to compel an
employee's attendance at an interview, management's authority is somehow imputed to OIG, or OIG somehow derives
its authority from the agency. This proposition seems dubious at best. The Inspector General is provided the authority to investigate under the Inspector General Act, and is

given power to effectuate her responsibilities through, inter
alia, requesting assistance as may be necessary in carrying
out her duties. 5 U. S. C. App. $ 6(a)(3). The head of theagency must furnish information and assistance to the IG,

"insofar as is practicable and not in contravention" of law.

$ 6(b)(1). Perhaps, then, when agency management directsan employee to appear at an OIG interview,

management
acts as OIG's agent.The proposition seems especially dubious in this case, as

P agreed to be interviewed. The record does not reveal thatNASA's management compelled him to attend the interview
nor does it reveal that P was threatened with discipline if he
did not attend the interview. The Eleventh Circuit, to be
sure, indicated that OIG's investigator threatened P with discipline if he did not answer the questions put to him. But
that threat, assuming it indeed was made, had little to do
with attendance and more to do with the conduct of the interview. As the Authority has interpreted $ 7114(a)(2)(B),
as the Court notes, ante, at 242, n. 7, no unfair labor practice
is committed if an employee who requests representation is
given the choice of proceeding without representation and
discontinuing the interview altogether. Perhaps it could be
argued that by threatening P with discipline if he did not
answer the questions put to him, rather than giving P the
choice of proceeding without representation, that OIG's investigator invoked agency management's authority to compel (continued) attendance. Along those lines, respondent
AFGE contends that OIG's representative must have been
acting for agency management by threatening P with discipline because only NASA's Administrator and his delegates,
5 U. S. C. $ 302(b)(1); 42 U. S. C. $ 2472(a), have the authority
to discipline agency employees. Brief for Respondent
AFGE 15-16. If OIG's investigator did mention that P
could face discipline, he was either simply stating a fact or
clearly acting ultra vires. OIG has no authority to discipline
or otherwise control agency employees. Since the mere in527US1 Unit: $U76 [05-02-01 17:40:57] PAGES PGT: OPLG
262 NASA v. FLRA

Thomas, J., dissenting
vocation of agency management's authority is not enough tovest that authority with OIG's investigator, the argument,

then, must be that it was reasonable for P to believe thatOIG's investigator might have the ability to exercise agency
management's authority. That is a question we simply can-not answer on this record. And more important, I do not
think that $ 7114(a)(2)(B) can be read to have its applicabilityturn on an after-the-fact assessment of interviewees' subjective perceptions, or even an assessment of their reasonablebeliefs.

* * *
In light of the Inspector General's independence--guaran-teed by statute and commonly understood as a practical reality--an investigator employed within NASA's OIG will not,in the usual course, represent NASA's management within
the meaning of $ 7114(a)(2)(B). Perhaps there are excep-tional cases where, under some unusual combination of facts,
investigators of the OIG might be said to represent agencymanagement, as the statute requires. Cf.

FLRA v. UnitedStates Dept. of Justice, 137 F. 3d 683, 690-691 (CA2 1997)

("So long as the OIG agent is questioning an employee forbona fide purposes within the authority of the [Inspector
General Act] and not merely accommodating the agency byconducting interrogation of the sort traditionally performed
by agency supervisory staff in the course of carrying outtheir personnel responsibilities, the OIG agent is not a `representative' of the employee's agency for purposes of section7114(a)(2)(B)"), cert. pending, No. 98-667. This case, however, certainly does not present such facts. For the forego-ing reasons, I respectfully dissent.

STRICKLER v. GREENE, WARDEN
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fourth circuit

No. 98-5864. Argued March 3, 1999--Decided June 17, 1999
The Commonwealth of Virginia charged petitioner with capital murder

and related crimes. Because an open file policy gave petitioner access
to all of the evidence in the prosecutor's files, petitioner's counsel did
not file a pretrial motion for discovery of possible exculpatory evidence.
At the trial, Anne Stoltzfus gave detailed eyewitness testimony about
the crimes and petitioner's role as one of the perpetrators. The prosecutor failed to disclose exculpatory materials in the police files, consisting of notes taken by a detective during interviews with Stoltzfus, and
letters written by Stoltzfus to the detective, that cast serious doubt on
significant portions of her testimony. The jury found petitioner guilty,
and he was sentenced to death. The Virginia Supreme Court affirmed.
In subsequent state habeas corpus proceedings, petitioner advanced an
ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim based, in part, on trial counsel's
failure to file a motion under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83, for disclosure of all exculpatory evidence known to the prosecution or in its possession. In response, the Commonwealth asserted that such a motion
was unnecessary because of the prosecutor's open file policy. The trial
court denied relief. The Virginia Supreme Court affirmed. Petitioner
then filed a federal habeas petition and was granted access to the exculpatory Stoltzfus materials for the first time. The District Court vacated petitioner's capital murder conviction and death sentence on the
grounds that the Commonwealth had failed to disclose those materials
and that petitioner had not, in consequence, received a fair trial. The
Fourth Circuit reversed because petitioner had procedurally defaulted
his Brady claim by not raising it at his trial or in the state collateral
proceedings. In addition, the Fourth Circuit concluded that the claim
was, in any event, without merit.

Held: Although petitioner has demonstrated cause for failing to raise a

Brady claim, Virginia did not violate Brady and its progeny by failing
to disclose exculpatory evidence to petitioner. Pp. 280-296.

(a) There are three essential components of a true Brady violation:
the evidence at issue must be favorable to the accused, either because
it is exculpatory, or because it is impeaching; that evidence must have
been suppressed by the State, either willfully or inadvertently; and
prejudice must have ensued. The record in this case unquestionably

527US1 Unit: $U77 [05-02-01 17:48:17] PAGES PGT: OPIN
264 STRICKLER v. GREENE

Syllabus
establishes two of those components. The contrast between (a) the terrifying incident that Stoltzfus confidently described in her testimony
and (b) her initial statement to the detective that the incident seemed
a trivial episode suffices to establish the impeaching character of the
undisclosed documents. Moreover, with respect to some of those documents, there is no dispute that they were known to the Commonwealth
but not disclosed to trial counsel. It is the third component--whether
petitioner has established the necessary prejudice--that is the most difficult element of the claimed Brady violation here. Because petitioner
acknowledges that his Brady claim is procedurally defaulted, this Court
must first decide whether that default is excused by an adequate showing of cause and prejudice. In this case, cause and prejudice parallel
two of the three components of the alleged Brady violation itself. The
suppression of the Stoltzfus documents constitutes one of the causes for
the failure to assert a Brady claim in the state courts, and unless those
documents were "material" for Brady purposes, see 373 U. S., at 87,
their suppression did not give rise to sufficient prejudice to overcome
the procedural default. Pp. 280-282.

(b) Petitioner has established cause for failing to raise a Brady claim
prior to federal habeas because (a) the prosecution withheld exculpatory
evidence; (b) petitioner reasonably relied on the prosecution's open file
policy as fulfilling the prosecution's duty to disclose such evidence; and
(c) the Commonwealth confirmed petitioner's reliance on the open file
policy by asserting during state habeas proceedings that petitioner had
already received everything known to the government. See Murray v.
Carrier, 477 U. S. 478, 488, and Amadeo v. Zant, 486 U. S. 214, 222.
Gray v. Netherland, 518 U. S. 152, and McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467,
distinguished. This Court need not decide whether any one or two of
the foregoing factors would be sufficient to constitute cause, since the
combination of all three surely suffices. Pp. 282-289.

(c) However, in order to obtain relief, petitioner must convince this
Court that there is a reasonable probability that his conviction or sentence would have been different had the suppressed documents been
disclosed to the defense. The adjective is important. The question is
not whether the defendant would more likely than not have received a
different verdict with the suppressed evidence, but whether in its absence he received a fair trial, understood as a trial resulting in a verdict
worthy of confidence. Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U. S. 419, 434. Here,
other evidence in the record provides strong support for the conclusion
that petitioner would have been convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death, even if Stoltzfus had been severely impeached or her
testimony excluded entirely. Notwithstanding the obvious significance

case considerably more difficult than the Fourth Circuit, wegranted certiorari, 525 U. S. 809 (1998), to consider (1)

I
In the early evening of January 5, 1990, Leanne Whitlock,an African-American sophomore at James Madison University, was abducted from a local shopping center and robbedand murdered. In separate trials, both petitioner and Ronald Henderson were convicted of all three offenses. Hen-derson was convicted of first-degree murder, a noncapital offense, whereas petitioner was convicted of capital murderand sentenced to death.

2

At both trials, a woman named Anne Stoltzfus testifiedin vivid detail about Whitlock's abduction. The exculpatory

material that petitioner claims should have been disclosedbefore trial includes documents prepared by Stoltzfus, and
notes of interviews with her, that impeach significant por-tions of her testimony. We begin, however, by noting that,
even without the Stoltzfus testimony, the evidence in the rec-ord was sufficient to establish petitioner's guilt on the murder charge. Whether petitioner would have been convictedof capital murder and received the death sentence if she had
not testified, or if she had been sufficiently impeached, is lessclear. To put the question in context, we review the trial
testimony at some length.
The Testimony at Trial

At about 4:30 p.m. on January 5, 1990, Whitlock borroweda 1986 blue Mercury Lynx from her boyfriend, John Dean,

2 Petitioner was tried in May 1990. Henderson fled the Commonwealth
and was later apprehended in Oregon. He was tried in March 1991.

Opinion of the Court
who worked in the Valley Shopping Mall in Harrisonburg,
Virginia. At about 6:30 or 6:45 p.m., she left her apartment,
intending to return the car to Dean at the mall. She did not
return the car and was not again seen alive by any of her
friends or family.

Petitioner's mother testified that she had driven petitioner
and Henderson to Harrisonburg on January 5. She also testified that petitioner always carried a hunting knife that had
belonged to his father. Two witnesses, a friend of Henderson's and a security guard, saw petitioner and Henderson at
the mall that afternoon. The security guard was informed
around 3:30 p.m. that two men, one of whom she identified at
trial as petitioner, were attempting to steal a car in the parking lot. She had them under observation during the remainder of the afternoon but lost sight of them at about 6:45.

At approximately 7:30 p.m., a witness named Kurt Massie
saw the blue Lynx at a location in Augusta County about 25
miles from Harrisonburg and a short distance from the cornfield where Whitlock's body was later found. Massie identified petitioner as the driver of the vehicle; he also saw a
white woman in the front seat and another man in the back.
Massie noticed that the car was muddy, and that it turned
off Route 340 onto a dirt road.

At about 8 p.m., another witness saw the Lynx at Buddy's
Market, with two men sitting in the front seat. The witness
did not see anyone else in the car. At approximately 9 p.m.,
petitioner and Henderson arrived at Dice's Inn, a bar in
Staunton, Virginia, where they stayed for about four or five
hours. They danced with several women, including four
prosecution witnesses: Donna Kay Tudor, Nancy Simmons,
Debra Sievers, and Carolyn Brown. While there, Henderson gave Nancy Simmons a watch that had belonged to Whitlock. Petitioner spent most of his time with Tudor, who was
later arrested for grand larceny based on her possession of
the blue Lynx.

268 STRICKLER v. GREENE

Opinion of the Court
These four women all testified that Tudor had arrived atDice's at about 8 p.m. Three of them noticed nothing unusual about petitioner's appearance, but Tudor saw someblood on his jeans and a cut on his knuckle. Tudor also testified that she, Henderson, and petitioner left Dice's together
after it closed to search for marijuana. Henderson was driv-ing the blue Lynx, and petitioner and Tudor rode in back.

Tudor related that petitioner was leaning toward Hendersonand talking with him; she overheard a crude conversation
that could reasonably be interpreted as describing the as-sault and murder of a black person with a "rock crusher."
Tudor stated that petitioner made a statement that impliedthat he had killed someone, so the person "wouldn't give him
no more trouble." App. 99. Tudor testified that while she,
petitioner, and Henderson were driving around, petitionertook out his knife and threatened to stab Henderson because

he was driving recklessly. Petitioner then began driving.

At about 4:30 or 5 a.m. on January 6, petitioner drove Henderson to Kenneth Workman's apartment in Timberville.3
Henderson went inside to get something, and petitioner and
Tudor drove off without waiting for him. Workman testified
that Henderson had blood on his pants and stated he had
killed a black person.

Petitioner and Tudor then drove to a motel in Blue Ridge.
A day or two later they went to Virginia Beach, where they
spent the rest of the week. Petitioner gave Tudor pearl earrings that Whitlock had been wearing when she was last
seen. Tudor saw Whitlock's driver's license and bank card
in the glove compartment of the car. Tudor testified that
petitioner unsuccessfully attempted to use Whitlock's bank
card when they were in Virginia Beach.

When petitioner and Tudor returned to Augusta County,
they abandoned the blue Lynx. On January 11, the police
identified the car as Dean's, and found petitioner's and Tu3 Workman was called as a defense witness.

Opinion of the Court
dor's fingerprints on both the inside and the outside of the
car. They also found shoe impressions that matched the
soles of shoes belonging to petitioner. Inside the car, they
retrieved a jacket that contained identification papers belonging to Henderson.

The police also recovered a bag at petitioner's mother's
house that Tudor testified she and petitioner had left when
they returned from Virginia Beach. The bag contained,
among other items, three identification cards belonging to
Whitlock and a black "tank top" shirt that was later found
to have human blood and semen stains on it. Tr. 707.

On January 13, a farmer called the police to advise them
that he had found Henderson's wallet; a search of the area
led to the discovery of Whitlock's frozen, nude, and battered
body. A 69-pound rock, spotted with blood, lay nearby. Forensic evidence indicated that Whitlock's death was caused
by "multiple blunt force injuries to the head." App. 109.
The location of the rock and the human blood on the rock
suggested that it had been used to inflict these injuries.
Based on the contents of Whitlock's stomach, the medical
examiner determined that she died fewer than six hours
after she had last eaten.4

A number of Caucasian hair samples were found at the
scene, three of which were probably petitioner's. Given the
weight of the rock, the prosecution argued that one of the
killers must have held the victim down while the other
struck her with the murder weapon.

Donna Tudor's estranged husband, Jay Tudor, was called
by the defense and testified that in March she had told him
that she was present at the murder scene and that petitioner
did not participate in the murder. Jay Tudor's testimony
was inconsistent in several respects with that of other witnesses. For example, he testified that several days elapsed

4 Whitlock's roommate testified that Whitlock had dinner at 6 p.m. on
January 5, 1990, just before she left for the mall to return Dean's car.

Anne Stoltzfus' Testimony

Anne Stoltzfus testified that on two occasions on January5 she saw petitioner, Henderson, and a blonde girl inside the

Harrisonburg mall, and that she later witnessed their abduction of Whitlock in the parking lot. She did not call thepolice, but a week and a half after the incident she discussed

it with classmates at James Madison University, where bothshe and Whitlock were students. One of them called the
police. The next night a detective visited her, and the fol-lowing morning she went to the police station and told her
story to Detective Claytor, a member of the HarrisonburgCity Police Department. Detective Claytor showed her
photographs of possible suspects, and she identified petitioner and Henderson "with absolute certainty" but statedthat she had a slight reservation about her identification of

the blonde woman. Id., at 56.At trial, Stoltzfus testified that, at about 6 p.m. on January
5, she and her 14-year-old daughter were in the Music Land
store in the mall looking for a compact disc. While she was
waiting for assistance from a clerk, petitioner, whom she described as "Mountain Man," and the blonde girl entered.5

5 She testified to their appearances in great detail. She stated that petitioner had "a kind of multi layer look." He wore a grey T-shirt with a
Harley Davidson insignia on it. The prosecutor showed Stoltzfus the
shirt, stained with blood and semen, that the police had discovered at
petitioner's mother's house. He asked if it were the same shirt she saw
petitioner wearing at the mall. She replied, "That could have been it."
App. 37, 39. Henderson "had either a white or light colored shirt, probably a short sleeve knit shirt and his pants were neat. They weren't just
old blue jeans. They may have been new blue jeans or it may have just
been more dressy slacks of some sort." Id., at 37. The woman "had
blonde hair, it was kind of in a shaggy cut down the back. She had blue
eyes, she had a real sweet smile, kind of a small mouth. Just a touch of
freckles on her face." Id., at 60.

Opinion of the Court
Because petitioner was "revved up" and "very impatient,"she was frightened and backed up, bumping into Henderson

(whom she called "Shy Guy"), and thought she felt somethinghard in the pocket of his coat. Id., at 36-37.

Stoltzfus left the store, intending to return later. Atabout 6:45, while heading back toward Music Land, she again
encountered the threesome: "Shy Guy" walking by himself,followed by the girl, and then "Mountain Man" yelling
"Donna, Donna, Donna." The girl bumped into Stoltzfusand then asked for directions to the bus stop.

6 The three

then left.At first Stoltzfus tried to follow them because of her concern about petitioner's behavior, but she "lost him" and thenheaded back to Music Land. The clerk had not returned, so
she and her daughter went to their car. While driving toanother store, they saw a shiny dark blue car. The driver
was "beautiful," "well dressed and she was happy, she wassinging . . . ." Id., at 41. When the blue car was stopped
behind a minivan at a stop sign, Stoltzfus saw petitioner forthe third time.

She testified:

" `Mountain Man' came tearing out of the Mall entrancedoor and went up to the driver of the van and . . . was

just really mad and ran back and banged on back ofthe backside of the van and then went back to the Mall
entrance wall where `Shy Guy' and `Blonde Girl' wasstanding . . . . [T]hen we left [and before the van and a
white pickup truck could turn] `Mountain Man' came outagain . . . ." Id., at 42-43.

After first going to the passenger side of the pickup truck,petitioner came back to the black girl's car, "pounded on" the
passenger window, shook the car, yanked the door open andjumped in. When he motioned for "Blonde Girl" and "Shy

walking in front of the car. The horn "blew a long time"and petitioner

"started hitting her . . . on the left shoulder, her rightshoulder and then it looked like to me that he started
hitting her on the head and I was, I just became con-cerned and upset. So I beeped, honked my horn and
then she stopped honking the horn and he stopped hit-ting her and opened the door again and the `Blonde Girl'
got in the back and `Shy Guy' followed and got behindhim."

Id., at 44-45.

Stoltzfus pulled her car up parallel to the blue car, got outfor a moment, got back in, and leaned over to ask repeatedly

if the other driver was "O.K." The driver looked "frozen"and mouthed an inaudible response. Stoltzfus started to
drive away and then realized "the only word that it couldpossibly be, was help."

Id., at 47. The blue car then droveslowly around her, went over the curb with its horn honking,

and headed out of the mall. Stoltzfus briefly followed, toldher daughter to write the license number on a "3x4 [inch]
index card," 7 and then left for home because she had anempty gas tank and "three kids at home waiting for supper."
Id., at 48-49.At trial Stoltzfus identified Whitlock from a picture as the
driver of the car and pointed to petitioner as "MountainMan." When asked if pretrial publicity about the murder
had influenced her identification, Stoltzfus replied "abso-lutely not." She explained:

"[F]irst of all, I have an exceptionally good memory. Ihad very close contact with [petitioner] and he made an

and I, he caught my attention and I paid attention. So
I have absolutely no doubt of my identification." Id.,
at 58.

The Commonwealth did not produce any other witnesses
to the abduction. Stoltzfus' daughter did not testify.

The Stoltzfus Documents

The materials that provide the basis of petitioner's Brady
claim consist of notes taken by Detective Claytor during his
interviews with Stoltzfus, and letters written by Stoltzfus
to Claytor. They cast serious doubt on Stoltzfus' confident
assertion of her "exceptionally good memory." Because the
content of the documents is critical to petitioner's procedural
and substantive claims, we summarize their content.

Exhibit 18 is a handwritten note prepared by Detective
Claytor after his first interview with Stoltzfus on January
19, 1990, just two weeks after the crime. The note indicates
that she could not identify the black female victim. The
only person Stoltzfus apparently could identify at this time
was the white female. Id., at 306.

Exhibit 2 is a document prepared by Detective Claytor
some time after February 1. It contains a summary of his
interviews with Stoltzfus conducted on January 19 and January 20, 1990.9 At that time "she was not sure whether she
could identify the white males but felt sure she could identify
the white female."

8 These materials were originally attached to an affidavit submitted with
petitioner's motion for summary judgment on his federal petition for habeas corpus. Because both the District Court and the Court of Appeals
referred to the documents by their exhibit numbers, we have done the
same.

9 As the District Court pointed out, however, it omits reference to the

fact that Stoltzfus originally said that she could not identify the victim--
a fact recorded in his handwritten notes. Id., at 387.

274 STRICKLER v. GREENE

Opinion of the Court
Exhibit 3 is entitled "Observations" and includes a sum-mary of the abduction.

Exhibit 4 is a letter written by Stoltzfus to Claytor threedays after their first interview "to clarify some of my confusion for you." The letter states that she had not remembered being at the mall, but that her daughter had helpedjog her memory. Her description of the abduction includes

the comment: "I have a very vague memory that I'm notsure of. It seems as if the wild guy that I saw had come
running through the door and up to a bus as the bus waspulling off. . . . Then the guy I saw came running up to the
black girl's window. Were those 2 memories the same per-son?"

Id., at 316. In a postscript she noted that her daughter "doesn't remember seeing the 3 people get into the black
girl's car . . . ." Ibid.Exhibit 5 is a note to Claytor captioned "My Impressions

of `The Car,' " which contains three paragraphs describing
the size of the car and comparing it with Stoltzfus' Volkswagen Rabbit, but not mentioning the license plate number that
she vividly recalled at the trial. Id., at 317-318.

Exhibit 6 is a brief note from Stoltzfus to Claytor dated
January 25, 1990, stating that after spending several hours
with John Dean, Whitlock's boyfriend, "looking at current
photos," she had identified Whitlock "beyond a shadow of a
doubt." 10 Id., at 318. The District Court noted that by the
time of trial her identification had been expanded to include
a description of her clothing and her appearance as a college
kid who was "singing" and "happy." Id., at 387-388.

Exhibit 7 is a letter from Stoltzfus to Detective Claytor,
dated January 16, 1990, in which she thanks him for his "patience with my sometimes muddled memories." She states
that if the student at school had not called the police, "I
never would have made any of the associations that you
helped me make." Id., at 321.

10 Stoltzfus' trial testimony made no mention of her meeting with Dean.

Opinion of the Court
In Exhibit 8, which is undated and summarizes the events
described in her trial testimony, Stoltzfus commented:

"So where is the 3x4 card? . . . It would have been
very nice if I could have remembered all this at the time
and had simply gone to the police with the information.
But I totally wrote this off as a trivial episode of college
kids carrying on and proceeded with my own full-time
college load at JMU. . . . Monday, January 15th. I was
cleaning out my car and found the 3x4 card. I tore it
into little pieces and put it in the bottom of a trash bag."
Id., at 326.

There is a dispute between the parties over whether petitioner's counsel saw Exhibits 2, 7, and 8 before trial. The
prosecuting attorney conceded that he himself never saw Exhibits 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 until long after petitioner's trial, and
they were not in the file he made available to petitioner.11
For purposes of this case, therefore, we assume that petitioner proceeded to trial without having seen Exhibits 1, 3,
4, 5, and 6.12

11 The prosecutor recalled that Exhibits 2, 7, and 8 had been in his open
file, id., at 365-368, but the lawyer who represented Henderson at his trial
swore that they were not in the file, id., at 330; the recollection of petitioner's trial counsel was somewhat equivocal. Lead defense counsel was
sure he had not seen the documents, id., at 300, while petitioner's other
lawyer signed an affidavit to the effect that he does "remember the information contained in [the documents]" but "cannot recall if I have seen
these specific documents," id., at 371.

12 Although the parties have not advanced an explanation for the nondisclosure of the documents, perhaps it was an inadvertent consequence
of the fact that Harrisonburg is in Rockingham County and the trial was
conducted by the Augusta County prosecutor. We note, however, that
the prosecutor is responsible for "any favorable evidence known to the
others acting on the government's behalf in the case, including the police."
Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U. S. 419, 437 (1995). Thus, the Commonwealth,
through its prosecutor, is charged with knowledge of the Stoltzfus materials for purposes of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963).

276 STRICKLER v. GREENE

Opinion of the Court
State Proceedings

Petitioner was tried in Augusta County, where Whitlock's
body was found, on charges of capital murder, robbery, andabduction. Because the prosecutor maintained an open file

policy, which gave petitioner's counsel access to all of theevidence in the Augusta County prosecutor's files,

13 petitioner's counsel did not file a pretrial motion for discovery ofpossible exculpatory evidence.

14 In closing argument, petitioner's lawyer effectively conceded that the evidence wassufficient to support the robbery and abduction charges, as

well as the lesser offense of first-degree murder, but argued
that the evidence was insufficient to prove that petitionerwas guilty of capital murder.

Id., at 192-193.
The judge instructed the jury that petitioner could befound guilty of the capital charge if the evidence established

beyond a reasonable doubt that he "jointly participated inthe fatal beating" and "was an active and immediate partici13 In the federal habeas proceedings, the prosecutor gave the following
sworn answer to an interrogatory requesting him to state what materials
were disclosed by him to defense counsel pursuant to Brady: "I disclosed
my entire prosecution file to Strickler's defense counsel prior to Strickler's
trial by allowing him to inspect my entire prosecution file including, but
not limited to, all police reports in the file and all witness statements in
the file." App. 368. Petitioner's trial counsel had shared the prosecutor's
understanding of the "open file" policy. In an affidavit filed in the state
habeas proceeding, they stated that they "thoroughly investigated" petitioner's case. "In this we were aided by the prosecutor's office, which
gave us full access to their files and the evidence they intended to present.
We made numerous visits to their office to examine these files . . . . As a
result of this cooperation, they introduced nothing at trial of which we
were previously unaware." Id., at 223.

14 In its pleadings on state habeas, the Commonwealth explained: "From

the inception of this case, the prosecutor's files were open to the petitioner's counsel. Each of the petitioner's attorneys made numerous visits to
the prosecutor's offices and reviewed all the evidence the Commonwealth
intended to present. . . . Given that counsel were voluntarily given full
disclosure of everything known to the government, there was no need for
a formal [Brady] motion." Id., at 212-213.

Opinion of the Court
pant in the act or acts that caused the victim's death." Id.,
at 160-161. The jury found petitioner guilty of abduction,
robbery, and capital murder. Id., at 200-201. After listening to testimony and arguments presented during the sentencing phase, the jury made findings of "vileness" and "future dangerousness," and unanimously recommended the
death sentence that the judge later imposed.

The Virginia Supreme Court affirmed the conviction and
sentence. Strickler v. Commonwealth, 241 Va. 482, 404
S. E. 2d 227 (1991). It held that the trial court had properly
instructed the jury on the "joint perpetrator" theory of capital murder and that the evidence, viewed most favorably in
support of the verdict, amply supported the prosecution's
theory that both petitioner and Henderson were active participants in the actual killing.15

In December 1991, the Augusta County Circuit Court appointed new counsel to represent petitioner in state habeas
corpus proceedings. State habeas counsel advanced an

15 "The Commonwealth's theory of the case was that Strickler and Henderson had acted jointly to accomplish the actual killing. It contended at
trial, and argues on appeal, that the physical evidence points to a violent
struggle between the assailants and the victim, in which Strickler's hair
had actually been torn out by the roots. Although Leanne had been
beaten and kicked, none of her injuries would have been sufficient to immobilize her until her skull was crushed with the 69-pound rock. Because, the Commonwealth's argument goes, the rock had been dropped on
her head at least twice, while she was on the ground, leaving two bloodstained depressions in the frozen earth, it would have been necessary that
she be held down by one assailant while the other lifted the rock and
dropped it on her head.

"The weight and dimensions of the 69-pound bloodstained rock, which
was introduced in evidence as an exhibit, made it apparent that a single
person could not have lifted it and dropped or thrown it while simultaneously holding the victim down. The bloodstains on Henderson's jacket as
well as on Strickler's clothing further tended to corroborate the Commonwealth's theory that the two men had been in the immediate presence of
the victim's body when the fatal blows were struck and, hence, had jointly
participated in the killing." Strickler, 241 Va., at 494, 404 S. E. 2d, at 235.

ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim based, in part, on trialcounsel's failure to file a motion under Brady v. Maryland,

373 U. S. 83 (1963), "to have the Commonwealth disclose tothe defense all exculpatory evidence known to it--or in its
possession." App. 205-206. In answer to that claim, theCommonwealth asserted that such a motion was unnecessary
because the prosecutor had maintained an open file policy.16The Circuit Court dismissed the petition, and the State
Supreme Court affirmed. Strickler v. Murray, 249 Va.120, 452 S. E. 2d 648 (1995).

Federal Habeas Corpus Proceedings

In March 1996, petitioner filed a federal habeas corpuspetition in the Eastern District of Virginia. The District

Court entered a sealed, ex parte order granting petitioner'scounsel the right to examine and to copy all of the police and
prosecution files in the case. Record, Doc. No. 20. Thatorder led to petitioner's counsel's first examination of the
Stoltzfus materials, described supra, at 273-275.Based on the discovery of those exhibits, petitioner for the
first time raised a direct claim that his conviction was invalidbecause the prosecution had failed to comply with the rule
of Brady v. Maryland. The District Court granted theCommonwealth's motion to dismiss all claims except for petitioner's contention that the Commonwealth violated Brady,that he received ineffective assistance of counsel,

17 and that

he was denied due process of law under the Fifth and Four-teenth Amendments. In its order denying the Commonwealth's motion to dismiss, the District Court found thatpetitioner had "demonstrated cause for his failure to raise
this claim earlier [because] [d]efense counsel had no inde-pendent access to this material and the Commonwealth repeatedly withheld it throughout Petitioner's state habeasproceeding." App. 287.

16 See n. 14, supra.
17 Petitioner later voluntarily dismissed this claim. App. 384.

Opinion of the Court
After reviewing the Stoltzfus materials, and making theassumption that the three disputed exhibits had been available to the defense, the District Court concluded that thefailure to disclose the other five was sufficiently prejudicial
to undermine confidence in the jury's verdict. Id., at 396.It granted summary judgment to petitioner and granted
the writ.The Court of Appeals vacated in part and remanded. It
held that petitioner's Brady claim was procedurally de-faulted because the factual basis for the claim was available
to him at the time he filed his state habeas petition. Giventhat he knew that Stoltzfus had been interviewed by Harrisonburg police officers, the court opined that "reasonablycompetent counsel would have sought discovery in state
court" of the police files, and that in response to this "simplerequest, it is likely the state court would have ordered the
production of the files." App. 421. Therefore, the Court ofAppeals reasoned, it could not address the Brady claim unless petitioner could demonstrate both cause and actualprejudice.

Under Fourth Circuit precedent a party "cannot establishcause to excuse his default if he should have known of such
claims through the exercise of reasonable diligence." App.423 (citing

Stockton v. Murray, 41 F. 3d 920, 925 (1994)).Having already decided that the claim was available to reasonably competent counsel, the Fourth Circuit stated thatthe basis for finding procedural default also foreclosed a
finding of cause. Moreover, the Court of Appeals reasoned,petitioner could not fault his trial lawyers' failure to make a
Brady claim because they reasonably relied on the prosecu-tor's open file policy. App. 423-424.

18

As an alternative basis for decision, the Court of Appealsalso held that petitioner could not establish prejudice be18 For reasons we do not entirely understand, the Court of Appeals thus
concluded that, while it was reasonable for trial counsel to rely on the
open file policy, it was unreasonable for postconviction counsel to do so.

Opinion of the Court
cause "the Stoltzfus materials would have provided little orno help . . . in either the guilt or sentencing phases of the

trial." Id., at 425. With respect to guilt, the court notedthat Stoltzfus' testimony was not relevant to petitioner's argument that he was only guilty of first-degree murder ratherthan capital murder because Henderson, rather than he,
actually killed Whitlock. With respect to sentencing, thecourt concluded that her testimony "was of no import" because the findings of future dangerousness and vilenessrested on other evidence. Finally, the court noted that even
if it could get beyond the procedural default, the Brady claimwould fail on the merits because of the absence of prejudice.
App. 425, n. 11. The Court of Appeals, therefore, reversedthe District Court's judgment and remanded the case with
instructions to dismiss the petition.

II
The first question that our order granting certiorari di-rected the parties to address is whether the Commonwealth

violated the Brady rule. We begin our analysis by identify-ing the essential components of a

Brady violation.In Brady, this Court held "that the suppression by the

prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon requestviolates due process where the evidence is material either to
guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or badfaith of the prosecution." 373 U. S., at 87. We have since
held that the duty to disclose such evidence is applicable eventhough there has been no request by the accused,

UnitedStates v. Agurs, 427 U. S. 97, 107 (1976), and that the duty

encompasses impeachment evidence as well as exculpatoryevidence,

United States v. Bagley, 473 U. S. 667, 676 (1985).Such evidence is material "if there is a reasonable probability

that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the re-sult of the proceeding would have been different." Id., at
682; see also Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U. S. 419, 433-434 (1995).Moreover, the rule encompasses evidence "known only to po527US1 Unit: $U77 [05-02-01 17:48:17] PAGES PGT: OPIN

281Cite as: 527 U. S. 263 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
lice investigators and not to the prosecutor." Id., at 438.
In order to comply with Brady, therefore, "the individual
prosecutor has a duty to learn of any favorable evidence
known to the others acting on the government's behalf in
this case, including the police." Kyles, 514 U. S., at 437.

These cases, together with earlier cases condemning the
knowing use of perjured testimony,19 illustrate the special
role played by the American prosecutor in the search for
truth in criminal trials. Within the federal system, for example, we have said that the United States Attorney is "the
representative not of an ordinary party to a controversy, but
of a sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as
compelling as its obligation to govern at all; and whose interest, therefore, in a criminal prosecution is not that it shall
win a case, but that justice shall be done." Berger v. United
States, 295 U. S. 78, 88 (1935).

This special status explains both the basis for the prosecution's broad duty of disclosure and our conclusion that not
every violation of that duty necessarily establishes that the
outcome was unjust. Thus the term "Brady violation" is
sometimes used to refer to any breach of the broad obligation
to disclose exculpatory evidence 20--that is, to any suppression of so-called "Brady material"--although, strictly speaking, there is never a real "Brady violation" unless the nondisclosure was so serious that there is a reasonable probability
that the suppressed evidence would have produced a different verdict. There are three components of a true Brady
violation: The evidence at issue must be favorable to the ac19 See, e. g., Mooney v. Holohan, 294 U. S. 103, 112 (1935) (per curiam);
Pyle v. Kansas, 317 U. S. 213, 216 (1942); Napue v. Illinois, 360 U. S. 264,
269-270 (1959).

20 Consider, for example, this comment in the dissenting opinion in Kyles

v. Whitley: "It is petitioner's burden to show that in light of all the evidence, including that untainted by the Brady violation, it is reasonably
probable that a jury would have entertained a reasonable doubt regarding
petitioner's guilt." 514 U. S., at 460 (opinion of Scalia, J.).

527US1 Unit: $U77 [05-02-01 17:48:17] PAGES PGT: OPIN
282 STRICKLER v. GREENE

Opinion of the Court
cused, either because it is exculpatory, or because it is im-peaching; that evidence must have been suppressed by the

State, either willfully or inadvertently; and prejudice musthave ensued.

Two of those components are unquestionably establishedby the record in this case. The contrast between (a) the
terrifying incident that Stoltzfus confidently described in hertestimony and (b) her initial perception of that event "as a
trivial episode of college kids carrying on" that her daughterdid not even notice, suffices to establish the impeaching character of the undisclosed documents.21 Moreover, with re-spect to at least five of those documents, there is no dispute
about the fact that they were known to the Commonwealthbut not disclosed to trial counsel. It is the third component--whether petitioner has established the prejudice nec-essary to satisfy the "materiality" inquiry--that is the most
difficult element of the claimed Brady violation in this case.Because petitioner acknowledges that his Brady claim is
procedurally defaulted, we must first decide whether thatdefault is excused by an adequate showing of cause and prejudice. In this case, cause and prejudice parallel two of thethree components of the alleged Brady violation itself. The
suppression of the Stoltzfus documents constitutes one of thecauses for the failure to assert a

Brady claim in the statecourts, and unless those documents were "material" for

Brady purposes, their suppression did not give rise to suffi-cient prejudice to overcome the procedural default.

III
Respondent expressly disavows any reliance on the factthat petitioner's Brady claim was not raised at trial. Brief

21 We reject respondent's contention that these documents do not fall
under Brady because they were "inculpatory." Brief for Respondent 41.
Our cases make clear that Brady's disclosure requirements extend to materials that, whatever their other characteristics, may be used to impeach
a witness. United States v. Bagley, 473 U. S. 667, 676 (1985).

Opinion of the Court
for Respondent 17-18, n. 6. He states that the Common-wealth has consistently argued "that the claim is defaulted

because it could have been raised on state habeas corpusthrough the exercise of due diligence, but was not."

Ibid.
Despite this concession, it is appropriate to begin the analysis of the "cause" issue by explaining why petitioner's rea-sons for failing to raise his

Brady claim at trial are acceptable under this Court's cases.Three factors explain why trial counsel did not advance

this claim: The documents were suppressed by the Common-wealth; the prosecutor maintained an open file policy;

22 and

trial counsel were not aware of the factual basis for theclaim. The first and second factors--

i. e., the nondisclosure
and the open file policy--are both fairly characterized as con-duct attributable to the Commonwealth that impeded trial

counsel's access to the factual basis for making a Bradyclaim.

23 As we explained in Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S.

478, 488 (1986), it is just such factors that ordinarily establish
the existence of cause for a procedural default.24

22 While the precise dimensions of an "open file policy" may vary from
jurisdiction to jurisdiction, in this case it is clear that the prosecutor's use
of the term meant that his entire prosecution file was made available to
the defense. App. 368; see also n. 13, supra.

23 We certainly do not criticize the prosecution's use of the open file policy. We recognize that this practice may increase the efficiency and the
fairness of the criminal process. We merely note that, if a prosecutor
asserts that he complies with Brady through an open file policy, defense
counsel may reasonably rely on that file to contain all materials the State
is constitutionally obligated to disclose under Brady.

24 "[W]e think that the existence of cause for a procedural default must

ordinarily turn on whether the prisoner can show that some objective
factor external to the defense impeded counsel's efforts to comply with
the State's procedural rule. Without attempting an exhaustive catalog of
such objective impediments to compliance with a procedural rule, we note
that a showing that the factual or legal basis for a claim was not reasonably available to counsel, see Reed v. Ross, 468 U. S., at 16, or that `some
interference by officials,' Brown v. Allen, 344 U. S. 443, 486 (1953), made
compliance impracticable, would constitute cause under this stand527US1 Unit: $U77 [05-02-01 17:48:17] PAGES PGT: OPIN
284 STRICKLER v. GREENE

Opinion of the Court
If it was reasonable for trial counsel to rely on, not just
the presumption that the prosecutor would fully perform his
duty to disclose all exculpatory materials, but also the implicit representation that such materials would be included
in the open files tendered to defense counsel for their examination, we think such reliance by counsel appointed to represent petitioner in state habeas proceedings was equally reasonable. Indeed, in Murray we expressly noted that "the
standard for cause should not vary depending on the timing
of a procedural default." Id., at 491.

Respondent contends, however, that the prosecution's
maintenance of an open file policy that did not include all it
was purported to contain is irrelevant because the factual
basis for the assertion of a Brady claim was available to state
habeas counsel. He presses two factors to support this assertion. First, he argues that an examination of Stoltzfus'
trial testimony,25 as well as a letter published in a local newspaper,26 made it clear that she had had several interviews
with Detective Claytor. Second, the fact that the Federal
District Court entered an order allowing discovery of the
Harrisonburg police files indicates that diligent counsel could

ard." Murray, 477 U. S., at 488; see also Amadeo v. Zant, 486 U. S. 214,
221-222 (1988).

25 Stoltzfus testified to meeting with Claytor at least three times.

App. 55-56.

26 In her letter, which appeared on July 18, 1990 (after petitioner's trial)

in the Harrisonburg Daily News-Record, Stoltzfus stated: "It never occurred to me that I was witnessing an abduction. In fact, if it hadn't
been for the intelligent, persistent, professional work of Detective Daniel
Claytor, I still wouldn't realize it. What sounded like a coherent story at
the trial was the result of an incredible effort by the police to fit a zillion
little puzzle pieces into one big picture." Id., at 250. Stoltzfus also gave
a pretrial interview to a reporter with the Roanoke Times that conflicted
in some respects with her trial testimony, principally because she identified the blonde woman at the mall as Tudor. Id., at 373.

Opinion of the Court
have obtained a similar order from the state court. We findneither factor persuasive.

Although it is true that petitioner's lawyers--both at trialand in post-trial proceedings--must have known that Stoltzfus had had multiple interviews with the police, it by nomeans follows that they would have known that records pertaining to those interviews, or that the notes that Stoltzfussent to the detective, existed and had been suppressed.

27

Indeed, if respondent is correct that Exhibits 2, 7, and 8 werein the prosecutor's "open file," it is especially unlikely that

counsel would have suspected that additional impeachingevidence was being withheld. The prosecutor must have
known about the newspaper articles and Stoltzfus' meetingswith Claytor, yet he did not believe that his prosecution file
was incomplete.Furthermore, the fact that the District Court entered a
broad discovery order even before federal habeas counselhad advanced a Brady claim does not demonstrate that a
state court also would have done so.28 Indeed, as we un-derstand Virginia law and respondent's position, petitioner
would not have been entitled to such discovery in state ha27 The defense could not discover copies of these notes from Stoltzfus
herself, because she refused to speak with defense counsel before trial.
Id., at 370.

28 The parties have been unable to provide, and the record does not illuminate, the factual basis on which the District Court entered the discovery order. It was granted ex parte and under seal and furnished broad
access to any records relating to petitioner. District Court Record, Doc.
No. 20. The Fourth Circuit has since found that federal district courts do
not possess the authority to issue ex parte discovery orders in habeas
proceedings. In re Pruett, 133 F. 3d 275, 280 (1997). We express no opinion on the Fourth Circuit's decision on this question. However, we note
that it is unlikely that petitioner would have been granted in state court
the sweeping discovery that led to the Stoltzfus materials, since Virginia
law limits discovery available during state habeas. Indeed, it is not even
clear that he had a right to such discovery in federal court. See n. 29,
infra.

beas proceedings without a showing of good cause.29 Even
pursuant to the broader discovery provisions afforded at
trial, petitioner would not have had access to these materials
under Virginia law, except as modified by Brady.30 Mere
speculation that some exculpatory material may have been
withheld is unlikely to establish good cause for a discovery
request on collateral review. Nor, in our opinion, should
such suspicion suffice to impose a duty on counsel to advance
a claim for which they have no evidentiary support. Proper
respect for state procedures counsels against a requirement
that all possible claims be raised in state collateral proceedings, even when no known facts support them. The presumption, well established by " `tradition and experience,' "
that prosecutors have fully " `discharged their official duties,' " United States v. Mezzanatto, 513 U. S. 196, 210 (1995),
is inconsistent with the novel suggestion that conscientious
defense counsel have a procedural obligation to assert consti29 Virginia law provides that "no discovery shall be allowed in any proceeding for a writ of habeas corpus or in the nature of coram nobis without
prior leave of the court, which may deny or limit discovery in any such
proceeding." Va. Sup. Ct. Rule 4:1(b)(5)(3)(b) (1998); see also Yeatts v.
Murray, 249 Va. 285, 289, 455 S. E. 2d 18, 21 (1995). Respondent acknowledges that petitioner was not entitled to discovery under Virginia law.
Brief for Respondent 25.

30 See Va. Sup. Ct. Rule 3A:11 (1998). This rule expressly excludes from

defendants "the discovery or inspection of statements made by Commonwealth witnesses or prospective Commonwealth witnesses to agents of the
Commonwealth or of reports, memoranda or other internal Commonwealth documents made by agents in connection with the investigation or
prosecution of the case, except [for scientific reports of the accused or
alleged victim]." The Virginia Supreme Court found that petitioner had
been afforded all the discovery he was entitled to on direct review. "Limited discovery is permitted in criminal cases by the Rules of Court. . . .
Strickler had the benefit of all the discovery to which he was entitled
under the Rules. Those rights do not extend to general production of
evidence, except in the limited areas prescribed by Rule 3A:11." Strickler v. Commonwealth, 241 Va. 482, 491, 404 S. E. 2d 227, 233 (1991).

Opinion of the Court
tutional error on the basis of mere suspicion that some prose-cutorial misstep may have occurred.

Respondent's position on the "cause" issue is particularlyweak in this case because the state habeas proceedings
confirmed petitioner's justification for his failure to raise a
Brady claim. As already noted, when he alleged that trialcounsel had been incompetent because they had not advanced such a claim, the warden responded by pointing outthat there was no need for counsel to do so because they
"were voluntarily given full disclosure of everything knownto the government."

31 Given that representation, petitioner had no basis for believing the Commonwealth hadfailed to comply with Brady at trial.

32

Respondent also argues that our decisions in Gray v. Neth-erland, 518 U. S. 152 (1996), and McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S.

467 (1991), preclude the conclusion that the cause for peti-tioner's default was adequate. In both of those cases, however, the petitioner was previously aware of the factual basisfor his claim but failed to raise it earlier. See

Gray, 518U. S., at 161; McCleskey, 499 U. S., at 498-499. In the context of a Brady claim, a defendant cannot conduct the "rea31 This statement is quoted in full at n. 14, supra. Respondent argues
that this representation is not dispositive because it was made in his motion to dismiss and therefore cannot excuse the failure to include a Brady
claim in the petitioner's original state habeas pleading. We find the timing of the statement irrelevant, since the warden's response merely summarizes the Commonwealth's "open file" policy, instituted by the prosecution at the inception of the case.

32 Furthermore, in its opposition to petitioner's motion during state habeas review for funds for an investigator, the Commonwealth argued:
"Strickler's Petition contains 139 separate habeas claims. By requesting
appointment of an investigator `to procure the necessary factual basis to
support certain of Petitioner's claims' (Motion, p. 1), Petitioner is implicitly
conceding that he is not aware of factual support for the claims he has
already made. Respondent agrees." App. 242.

In light of these assertions, we fail to see how the Commonwealth believes petitioner could have shown "good cause" sufficient to get discovery
on a Brady claim in state habeas.

Opinion of the Court
sonable and diligent investigation" mandated by McCleskeyto preclude a finding of procedural default when the evidence

is in the hands of the State.33The controlling precedents on "cause" are Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S., at 488, and Amadeo v. Zant, 486 U. S. 214(1988). As we explained in the latter case:

"If the District Attorney's memorandum was not reason-ably discoverable because it was concealed by Putnam
County officials, and if that concealment, rather thantactical considerations, was the reason for the failure of
petitioner's lawyers to raise the jury challenge in thetrial court, then petitioner established ample cause to
excuse his procedural default under this Court's prece-dents."

Id., at 222.34

There is no suggestion that tactical considerations playedany role in petitioner's failure to raise his

Brady claim instate court. Moreover, under Brady an inadvertent nondisclosure has the same impact on the fairness of the proceed-ings as deliberate concealment. "If the suppression of evidence results in constitutional error, it is because of thecharacter of the evidence, not the character of the prosecutor." Agurs, 427 U. S., at 110.

33 We do not reach, because it is not raised in this case, the impact of a
showing by the State that the defendant was aware of the existence of the
documents in question and knew, or could reasonably discover, how to
obtain them. Although Gray involved a procedurally defaulted Brady
claim, in that case, the Court found that the petitioner had made "no
attempt to demonstrate cause or prejudice for his default." Gray, 518
U. S., at 162.

34 It is noteworthy that both of the reasons on which we relied in McCleskey to distinguish Amadeo also apply to this case: "This case differs
from Amadeo in two crucial respects. First, there is no finding that the
State concealed evidence. And second, even if the State intentionally
concealed the 21-page document, the concealment would not establish
cause here because, in light of McCleskey's knowledge of the information
in the document, any initial concealment would not have prevented him
from raising the claim in the first federal petition." 499 U. S., at 501-502.

Opinion of the Court
In summary, petitioner has established cause for failing to
raise a Brady claim prior to federal habeas because (a) the
prosecution withheld exculpatory evidence; (b) petitioner
reasonably relied on the prosecution's open file policy as
fulfilling the prosecution's duty to disclose such evidence;
and (c) the Commonwealth confirmed petitioner's reliance on
the open file policy by asserting during state habeas proceedings that petitioner had already received "everything known
to the government." 35 We need not decide in this case
whether any one or two of these factors would be sufficient
to constitute cause, since the combination of all three
surely suffices.

IV

The differing judgments of the District Court and the
Court of Appeals attest to the difficulty of resolving the issue
of prejudice. Unlike the Fourth Circuit, we do not believe
that "the Stolzfus [sic] materials would have provided little
or no help to Strickler in either the guilt or sentencing
phases of the trial." App. 425. Without a doubt, Stoltzfus'
testimony was prejudicial in the sense that it made petitioner's conviction more likely than if she had not testified, and
discrediting her testimony might have changed the outcome
of the trial.

That, however, is not the standard that petitioner must
satisfy in order to obtain relief. He must convince us that
"there is a reasonable probability" that the result of the trial
would have been different if the suppressed documents had
been disclosed to the defense. As we stressed in Kyles:
"[T]he adjective is important. The question is not whether
the defendant would more likely than not have received a
different verdict with the evidence, but whether in its ab35 Because our opinion does not modify Brady, we reject respondent's
contention that we announce a "new rule" today. See Bousley v. United
States, 523 U. S. 614 (1998).

290 STRICKLER v. GREENE

Opinion of the Court
sence he received a fair trial, understood as a trial resulting
in a verdict worthy of confidence." 514 U. S., at 434.

The Court of Appeals' negative answer to that question
rested on its conclusion that, without considering Stoltzfus'
testimony, the record contained ample, independent evidence
of guilt, as well as evidence sufficient to support the findings
of vileness and future dangerousness that warranted the imposition of the death penalty. The standard used by that
court was incorrect. As we made clear in Kyles, the materiality inquiry is not just a matter of determining whether,
after discounting the inculpatory evidence in light of the undisclosed evidence, the remaining evidence is sufficient to
support the jury's conclusions. Id., at 434-435. Rather,
the question is whether "the favorable evidence could reasonably be taken to put the whole case in such a different
light as to undermine confidence in the verdict." Id., at 435.

The District Judge decided not to hold an evidentiary
hearing to determine whether Exhibits 2, 7, and 8 had been
disclosed to the defense, because he was satisfied that the
"potentially devastating impeachment material" contained in
the other five warranted the entry of summary judgment in
petitioner's favor. App. 392. The District Court's conclusion that the admittedly undisclosed documents were sufficiently important to establish a violation of the Brady rule
was supported by the prosecutor's closing argument. That
argument relied on Stoltzfus' testimony to demonstrate petitioner's violent propensities and to establish that he was the
instigator and leader in Whitlock's abduction and, by inference, her murder. The prosecutor emphasized the importance of Stoltzfus' testimony in proving the abduction:

"[W]e are lucky enough to have an eyewitness who saw
[what] happened out there in that parking lot. [In a] lot
of cases you don't. A lot of cases you can just theorize
what happened in the actual abduction. But Mrs. Stoltzfus was there, she saw [what] happened." App. 169.

Opinion of the Court
Given the record evidence involving Henderson,36 the District Court concluded that, without Stoltzfus' testimony, the
jury might have been persuaded that Henderson, rather than
petitioner, was the ringleader. He reasoned that a "reasonable probability of conviction" of first-degree, rather than
capital, murder sufficed to establish the materiality of the
undisclosed Stoltzfus materials and, thus, a Brady violation.
App. 396.

The District Court was surely correct that there is a reasonable possibility that either a total, or just a substantial,
discount of Stoltzfus' testimony might have produced a different result, either at the guilt or sentencing phases. Petitioner did, for example, introduce substantial mitigating evidence about abuse he had suffered as a child at the hands of
his stepfather.37 As the District Court recognized, however,
petitioner's burden is to establish a reasonable probability
of a different result. Kyles, 514 U. S., at 434.

36 The District Court summarized the evidence against Henderson.
"Henderson's clothes had blood on them that night. Henderson had property belonging to Whitlock and gave her watch to a woman, Simmons,
while at a restaurant known as Dice's Inn. Tr. 541. Henderson left
Dice's Inn driving Whitlock's car. Henderson's wallet was found in the
vicinity of Whitlock's body and was possibly lost during his struggle with
her. Significantly, Henderson confessed to a friend on the night of the
murder that he had just killed an unidentified black person and that friend
observed blood on Henderson's jeans." App. 395.

37 At sentencing, the trial court discussed the mitigation evidence: "On

the charge of capital murder . . . it is difficult . . . to sit here and listen to
the testimony of [petitioner's mother] and Mr. Strickler's two sisters and
not feel a great, great deal of sympathy for, for any person who has a
childhood and a life like Mr. Strickler has had. He was in no way responsible for the circumstances of his birth. He was brutalized from the minute he's, almost from the minute he was born and certainly with his . . .
limitations and his ability with which he was born, it would have been
extremely difficult for him to, to help himself. And difficult, when you
look at a case like that to feel but anything but sympathy for him." Sentencing Hearing, 20 Record 57-58.

292 STRICKLER v. GREENE

Opinion of the Court
Even if Stoltzfus and her testimony had been entirely dis-credited, the jury might still have concluded that petitioner

was the leader of the criminal enterprise because he was theone seen driving the car by Kurt Massie near the location of
the murder and the one who kept the car for the followingweek.

38 In addition, Tudor testified that petitioner threatened Henderson with a knife later in the evening.More importantly, however, petitioner's guilt of capital

murder did not depend on proof that he was the dominantpartner: Proof that he was an equal participant with Henderson was sufficient under the judge's instructions.39 Accord-ingly, the strong evidence that Henderson was a killer is entirely consistent with the conclusion that petitioner was alsoan actual participant in the killing.

40

38 As the trial court stated at petitioner's sentencing hearing: "The facts
in this case which support this jury verdict are one that Mr. Strickler
was . . . in control of this situation. He was in control at the shopping
center in Harrisonburg. He was in control when the car went into the
field up here on the 340 north of Waynesboro. He was in control thereafter, he ended up with the car. There is no question who . . . was in control
of this entire situation." Id., at 22.

39 The judge gave the following instruction at petitioner's trial: "You

may find the defendant guilty of capital murder if the evidence establishes
that the defendant jointly participated in the fatal beating, if it is established beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was an active and
immediate participant in the act or acts that caused the victim's death."
Strickler v. Commonwealth, 241 Va., at 493-494, 404 S. E. 2d, at 234-235.
The Virginia Supreme Court affirmed the propriety of this instruction on
petitioner's direct appeal. Id., at 495, 404 S. E. 2d, at 235.

40 It is also consistent with the fact that Henderson was convicted of

first-degree murder but acquitted of capital murder after his jury, unlike
petitioner's, was instructed that they could convict him of capital murder
only if they found that he had " `inflict[ed] the fatal blows.' " Henderson's
jury was instructed, " `One who is present aiding and abetting the actual
killing, but who does not inflict the fatal blows that cause death is a principle [sic] in the second degree, and may not be found guilty of capital murder. Before you can find the defendant guilty of capital murder, the evidence must establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was

Opinion of the Court
Furthermore, there was considerable forensic and other
physical evidence linking petitioner to the crime.41 The
weight and size of the rock,42 and the character of the fatal
injuries to the victim,43 are powerful evidence supporting the
conclusion that two people acted jointly to commit a brutal
murder.

We recognize the importance of eyewitness testimony;
Stoltzfus provided the only disinterested, narrative account
of what transpired on January 5, 1990. However, Stoltzfus'
vivid description of the events at the mall was not the only
evidence that the jury had before it. Two other eyewitan active and immediate participant in the acts that caused the death.' "
2 App. in No. 97-29 (CA4), p. 777.

Henderson's trial took place before the Virginia Supreme Court affirmed
the trial instruction, and the "joint perpetrator" theory it embodied, given
at petitioner's trial. Strickler v. Commonwealth, 241 Va., at 494, 404 S. E.
2d, at 235. Petitioner's trial judge rejected one of petitioner's proffered
instructions, which would have required the Commonwealth to prove that
"the defendant was the person who actually delivered the blow that killed
Leanne Whitlock." Ibid. Petitioner's trial judge recused himself from
presiding over Henderson's trial, indicating that he had already formed
his own opinion about what had happened the night of Whitlock's murder.
21 Record 2.

41 For example, the police recovered hairs on a bra and shirt found with

Whitlock's body that "were microscopically alike in all identifiable characteristics" to petitioner's hair. App. 135. The shirt recovered from the
car at Strickler's mother's house had human blood on it. Petitioner's fingerprints were found on the outside and inside of the car taken from Whitlock. Id., at 128-129. Tudor testified that petitioner's pants had blood
on them, and he had a cut on his knuckle. Id., at 95.

42 The trial judge thought the shape of the rock so significant to the

jury's conclusion that he instructed the lawyers to have "detailed, high
quality photographs taken of [the rock] . . . and I want it put in the record
of the case." Sentencing Hearing, 20 Record 53.

43 The Deputy Chief Medical Examiner, who performed the autopsy, testified that the object that produced the fractures in Whitlock's skull caused
"severe lacerations to the brain," and any two of the four fractures would
have been fatal. App. 112.

Opinion of the Court
nesses, the security guard and Henderson's friend, placedpetitioner and Henderson at the Harrisonburg Valley Shopping Mall on the afternoon of Whitlock's murder. One eye-witness later saw petitioner driving Dean's car near the
scene of the murder.The record provides strong support for the conclusion that
petitioner would have been convicted of capital murder andsentenced to death, even if Stoltzfus had been severely impeached. The jury was instructed on two predicates forcapital murder: robbery with a deadly weapon and abduction
with intent to defile.44 On state habeas, the Virginia Su-preme Court rejected as procedurally barred petitioner's
challenge to this jury instruction on the ground that "abduc-tion with intent to defile" was not a predicate for capital
murder for a victim over the age of 12.45 That issue is not
before us. Even assuming, however, that this predicate waserroneous, armed robbery still would have supported the

capital murder conviction.

Petitioner argues that the prosecution's evidence on armedrobbery "flowed almost entirely from inferences from Stoltzfus' testimony," and especially from her statement that Hen-derson had a "hard object" under his coat at the mall. Brief
for Petitioner 35. That argument, however, ignores the factthat petitioner's mother and Tudor provided direct evidence
that petitioner had a knife with him on the day of the crime.

44 The trial court instructed the jury that, to convict petitioner of capital
murder, it must find beyond a reasonable doubt that (1) "the defendant
killed Leanne Whitlock"; (2) "the killing was willful, deliberate and premeditated"; and (3) "the killing occurred during the commission of robbery
while the defendant was armed with a deadly weapon, or occurred during
the commission of abduction with intent to extort money or a pecuniary
benefit or with the intent to defile or was of a person during the commission of, or subsequent to, rape." Strickler v. Murray, 249 Va. 120, 124-
125, 452 S. E. 2d 648, 650 (1995).

45 In its motion to dismiss petitioner's state habeas petition, the Commonwealth conceded that the instruction on intent to defile was erroneously given in this case as a predicate for capital murder. App. 218.

295Cite as: 527 U. S. 263 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
In addition, the prosecution contended in its closing argument that the rock--not the knife--was the murder
weapon.46 The prosecution did advance the theory that
petitioner had a knife when he got in the car with Whitlock,
but it did not specifically argue that petitioner used the knife
during the robbery.47

Petitioner also maintains that he suffered prejudice from
the failure to disclose the Stoltzfus documents because her
testimony impacted on the jury's decision to impose the
death penalty. Her testimony, however, did not relate to his
eligibility for the death sentence and was not relied upon by
the prosecution at all during its closing argument at the penalty phase.48 With respect to the jury's discretionary decision to impose the death penalty, it is true that Stoltzfus
described petitioner as a violent, aggressive person, but that
portrayal surely was not as damaging as either the evidence
that he spent the evening of the murder dancing and drinking at Dice's or the powerful message conveyed by the 69-

46 In his closing argument, the prosecutor stated that there was "really
no doubt about where it happened and what the murder weapon was. It
was not a gun, it wasn't a knife. It was this thing here, it is to[o] big to
be called a rock and to[o] small to be called a boulder." Id., at 167.

47 The instructions given to the jury defined a deadly weapon as "any

object or instrument that is likely to cause death or great bodily injury
because of the manner and under the circumstance in which it is used."
Id., at 160.

48 The jury recommended death after finding the predicates of "future

dangerousness" and "vileness." Neither of these predicates depended on
Stoltzfus' testimony. The trial court instructed the jury, "Before the penalty can be fixed at death, the Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt at least one of the following two alternatives. One, that
after consideration of his history and background, there is a probability
that he would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a
continuing, continuing serious threat to society or two, that his conduct
in committing the offense was outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible or
inhuman and that it involved torture, depravity of mind or aggravated
battery to the victim beyond the minimum necessary to accomplish the
act of murder." Tr. 899-900.

pound rock that was part of the record before the jury. Not-withstanding the obvious significance of Stoltzfus' testimony,

petitioner has not convinced us that there is a reasonableprobability that the jury would have returned a different
verdict if her testimony had been either severely impeachedor excluded entirely.

Petitioner has satisfied two of the three components of aconstitutional violation under

Brady: exculpatory evidenceand nondisclosure of this evidence by the prosecution. Petitioner has also demonstrated cause for failing to raise thisclaim during trial or on state postconviction review. However, petitioner has not shown that there is a reasonableprobability that his conviction or sentence would have been
different had these materials been disclosed. He thereforecannot show materiality under

Brady or prejudice from hisfailure to raise the claim earlier. Accordingly, the judgment

of the Court of Appeals is Affirmed.

Justice Souter, with whom Justice Kennedy joins asto Part II, concurring in part and dissenting in part.
I look at this case much as the Court does, starting withits view in Part III (which I join) that Strickler has shown
cause to excuse the procedural default of his Brady claim.Like the Court, I think it clear that the materials withheld
were exculpatory as devastating ammunition for impeachingStoltzfus.

1 See ante, at 282. Even on the question of preju1 The Court notes that the District Court did not resolve whether all
eight of the Stoltzfus documents had been withheld, as Strickler claimed,
or only five. For purposes of its decision granting summary judgment for
Strickler, the District Court assumed that only five had not been disclosed.
See ante, at 290, 279. The Court of Appeals also left the dispute unresolved, see App. 418, n. 8, though granting summary judgment for respondent based on a lack of prejudice would presumably have required
that court to assume that all eight documents had been withheld. Because this Court affirms the grant of summary judgment for respondent
based on lack of prejudice and because it relies on at least one of the

Opinion of Souter, J.
dice or materiality,2 over which I ultimately part companywith the majority, I am persuaded that Strickler has failed

to establish a reasonable probability that, had the materialswithheld been disclosed, he would not have been found guilty
of capital murder. See ante, at 292-296. As the Court says,however, the prejudice enquiry does not stop at the conviction but goes to each step of the sentencing process: thejury's consideration of aggravating, death-qualifying facts,
the jury's discretionary recommendation of a death sentenceif it finds the requisite aggravating factors, and the judge's
discretionary decision to follow the jury's recommendation.See

ante, at 294-296. It is with respect to the penultimatestep in determining the sentence that I think Strickler has

carried his burden. I believe there is a reasonable probabil-ity (which I take to mean a significant possibility) that disclosure of the Stoltzfus materials would have led the jury torecommend life, not death, and I respectfully dissent.

I
Before I get to the analysis of prejudice I should say some-thing about the standard for identifying it, and about the

unfortunate phrasing of the shorthand version in which thestandard is customarily couched. The Court speaks in
terms of the familiar, and perhaps familiarly deceptive, for-mulation: whether there is a "reasonable probability" of a
different outcome if the evidence withheld had been dis-closed. The Court rightly cautions that the standard indisputed documents in its analysis, see ante, at 282, I understand it to
have assumed that none of the eight documents was disclosed. I proceed
based on that assumption as well. If one thought the difference between
five and eight documents withheld would affect the determination of prejudice, a remand to resolve that factual question would be necessary.

2 In keeping with suggestions in a number of our opinions, see Schlup v.

Delo, 513 U. S. 298, 327, n. 45 (1995); Sawyer v. Whitley, 505 U. S. 333, 345
(1992), the Court treats the prejudice enquiry as synonymous with the
materiality determination under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963).
See ante, at 282, 288-289, 296. I follow the Court's lead.

Opinion of Souter, J.
tended by these words does not require defendants to showthat a different outcome would have been more likely than

not with the suppressed evidence, let alone that without thematerials withheld the evidence would have been insufficient
to support the result reached. See ante, at 289-290; Kyles
v. Whitley, 514 U. S. 419, 434-435 (1995). Instead, the Courtrestates the question (as I have done elsewhere) as whether

" `the favorable evidence could reasonably be taken to putthe whole case in such a different light as to undermine
confidence' " in the outcome. Ante, at 290 (quoting Kyles,
supra, at 435).

Despite our repeated explanation of the shorthand formulation in these words, the continued use of the term "probability" raises an unjustifiable risk of misleading courts into
treating it as akin to the more demanding standard, "more
likely than not." While any short phrases for what the
cases are getting at will be "inevitably imprecise," United
States v. Agurs, 427 U. S. 97, 108 (1976), I think "significant
possibility" would do better at capturing the degree to which
the undisclosed evidence would place the actual result in
question, sufficient to warrant overturning a conviction or
sentence.

To see that this is so, we need to recall Brady's evolution
since the appearance of the rule as originally stated, that
"suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an
accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution."
Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83, 87 (1963). Brady itself did
not explain what it meant by "material" (perhaps assuming
the term would be given its usual meaning in the law of
evidence, see United States v. Bagley, 473 U. S. 667, 703, n. 5
(1985) (Marshall, J., dissenting)). We first essayed a partial
definition in United States v. Agurs, supra, where we identified three situations arguably within the ambit of Brady and
said that in the first, involving knowing use of perjured testi527US1 Unit: $U77 [05-02-01 17:48:17] PAGES PGT: OPIN

mony, reversal was required if there was "any reasonable
likelihood" that the false testimony had affected the verdict.
Agurs, supra, at 103 (citing Giglio v. United States, 405 U. S.
150, 154 (1972), in turn quoting Napue v. Illinois, 360 U. S.
264, 271 (1959)). We have treated "reasonable likelihood"
as synonymous with "reasonable possibility" and thus have
equated materiality in the perjured-testimony cases with a
showing that suppression of the evidence was not harmless
beyond a reasonable doubt. Bagley, supra, at 678-680, and
n. 9 (opinion of Blackmun, J.). See also Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U. S. 619, 637 (1993) (defining harmless-beyond-areasonable-doubt standard as no " `reasonable possibility'
that trial error contributed to the verdict"); Chapman v.
California, 386 U. S. 18, 24 (1967) (same). In Agurs, we
thought a less demanding standard appropriate when the
prosecution fails to turn over materials in the absence of a
specific request. Although we refrained from attaching a
label to that standard, we explained it as falling between the
more-likely-than-not level and yet another criterion, whether
the reviewing court's " `conviction [was] sure that the error
did not influence the jury, or had but very slight effect.' "
427 U. S., at 112 (quoting Kotteakos v. United States, 328
U. S. 750, 764 (1946)). Finally, in United States v. Bagley,
supra, we embraced "reasonable probability" as the appropriate standard to judge the materiality of information withheld by the prosecution whether or not the defense had
asked first. Bagley took that phrase from Strickland v.
Washington, 466 U. S. 668, 694 (1984), where it had been used
for the level of prejudice needed to make out a claim of constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel. Strickland in
turn cited two cases for its formulation, Agurs (which did not
contain the expression "reasonable probability") and United
States v. Valenzuela-Bernal, 458 U. S. 858, 873-874 (1982)
(which held that sanctions against the Government for deportation of a potential defense witness were appropriate only

Opinion of Souter, J.
if there was a "reasonable likelihood" that the lost testimony"could have affected the judgment of the trier of fact").

The circuitous path by which the Court came to adopt"reasonable probability" of a different result as the rule of
Brady materiality suggests several things. First, while"reasonable possibility" or "reasonable likelihood," the

Kot-teakos standard, and "reasonable probability" express distinct levels of confidence concerning the hypothetical effectsof errors on decisionmakers' reasoning, the differences
among the standards are slight. Second, the gap betweenall three of those formulations and "more likely than not" is
greater than any differences among them. Third, becauseof that larger gap, it is misleading in

Brady cases to use theterm "probability," which is naturally read as the cognate of

"probably" and thus confused with "more likely than not,"see Morris v. Mathews, 475 U. S. 237, 247 (1986) (apparently
treating "reasonable probability" as synonymous with "prob-ably"); id., at 254, n. 3 (Blackmun, J., concurring in judgment)
(cautioning against confusing "reasonable probability" withmore likely than not). We would be better off speaking of
a "significant possibility" of a different result to characterizethe

Brady materiality standard. Even then, given the softedges of all these phrases,

3 the touchstone of the enquiry

3 Each of these phrases or standards has been used in a number of contexts. This Court has used "reasonable possibility," for example, in defining the level of threat of injury to competition needed to make out a claim
under the Robinson-Patman Act, see, e. g., Brooke Group Ltd. v. Brown &
Williamson Tobacco Corp., 509 U. S. 209, 222 (1993); the standard for judging whether a grand jury subpoena should be quashed under Federal Rule
of Criminal Procedure 17(c), see United States v. R. Enterprises, Inc., 498
U. S. 292, 301 (1991); and the debtor's burden in establishing that certain
collateral is necessary to reorganization and thus exempt from the Bankruptcy Code's automatic stay provision, see United Sav. Assn. of Tex. v.
Timbers of Inwood Forest Associates, Ltd., 484 U. S. 365, 375-376 (1988).
We have adopted the standard established in Kotteakos v. United States,
328 U. S. 750 (1946), for determining the harmlessness of nonconstitutional
errors on direct review as the criterion for the harmlessness enquiry concerning constitutional errors on collateral review. See Brecht v. Abra527US1 Unit: $U77 [05-02-01 17:48:17] PAGES PGT: OPIN

301Cite as: 527 U. S. 263 (1999)
Opinion of Souter, J.
must remain whether the evidentiary suppression "under-mines our confidence" that the factfinder would have reached

the same result. II

Even keeping in mind these caveats about the appropriatelevel of materiality, applying the standard to the facts of this
case does not give the Court easy answers, as the Courtcandidly acknowledges. See

ante, at 289. Indeed, the Courtconcedes that discrediting Stoltzfus's testimony "might have

changed the outcome of the trial," ibid., and that the DistrictCourt was "surely correct" to find a "reasonable possibility
that either a total, or just a substantial, discount of Stoltzfus'testimony might have produced a different result, either at
the guilt or sentencing phases," ante, at 291.In the end, however, the Court finds the undisclosed evidence inadequate to undermine confidence in the jury's senhamson, 507 U. S. 619, 637-638 (1993). We have used "reasonable probability" to define the plaintiff's burden in making out a claim under $ 7 of
the Clayton Act, see, e. g., Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, 370 U. S. 294,
325 (1962); FTC v. Morton Salt Co., 334 U. S. 37, 55-61 (1948) (Jackson, J.,
dissenting in part) (contrasting "reasonable possibility" and "reasonable
probability" and arguing for latter as appropriate standard under
Robinson-Patman Act); the standard for granting certiorari, vacating, and
remanding in light of intervening developments, see, e. g., Lawrence v.
Chater, 516 U. S. 163, 167 (1996) (per curiam); and the standard for exempting organizations from otherwise valid disclosure requirements in
light of threats or harassment resulting from the disclosure, see, e. g.,
Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 74 (1976) (per curiam). We have recently
used "significant possibility" in explaining the circumstances under which
nominal compensation is an appropriate award in a suit under the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, see Metropolitan Stevedore Co. v. Rambo, 521 U. S. 121, 123 (1997), but we most commonly use
that term in defining one of the requirements for the granting of a stay
pending certiorari. The three-part test requires a "reasonable probability" that the Court will grant certiorari or note probable jurisdiction, a
"significant possibility" that the Court will reverse the decision below,
and a likelihood of irreparable injury absent a stay. See, e. g., Barefoot v.
Estelle, 463 U. S. 880, 895 (1983); Packwood v. Senate Select Comm. on
Ethics, 510 U. S. 1319 (1994) (Rehnquist, C. J., in chambers).

302 STRICKLER v. GREENE

Opinion of Souter, J.
tencing recommendation, whereas I find it sufficient to dothat. Since we apply the same standard to the same record,

our differing conclusions largely reflect different assess-ments of the significance the jurors probably ascribed to the
Stoltzfus testimony. My assessment turns on two points.
First, I believe that in making the ultimate judgment aboutwhat should be done to one of several participants in a crime

this appalling the jurors would very likely have given weightto the degree of initiative and leadership exercised by that
particular defendant. Second, I believe that no other testi-mony comes close to the prominence and force of Stoltzfus's
account in showing Strickler as the unquestionably dominant
member of the trio involved in Whitlock's abduction and the
aggressive and moving figure behind her murder.

Although Stoltzfus was not the prosecution's first witness,
she was the first to describe Strickler in any detail, thus
providing the frame for the remainder of the story the prosecution presented to the jury. From the start of Stoltzfus's
testimony, Strickler was "Mountain Man" and his male companion "Shy Guy," labels whose repetition more than a dozen
times (by the prosecutor as well as by Stoltzfus) must have
left the jurors with a clear sense of the relative roles that
Strickler and Henderson played in the crimes that followed
Stoltzfus's observation. According to her, when she first
saw Strickler she "just sort of instinctively backed up because I was frightened." App. 36. Unlike retiring "Shy
Guy," Strickler was "revved up." Id., at 39, 60. Even in
describing her first encounter with Strickler inside the mall,
Stoltzfus spoke of him as domineering, a "very impatient"
character yelling at his female companion, "Blonde Girl," to
join him. Id., at 36, 38-39.

After describing in detail how "Mountain Man" and
"Blonde Girl" were dressed, Stoltzfus said that " `Mountain
Man' came tearing out of the Mall entrance door and went
up to the driver of [a] van and . . . was just really mad and
ran back and banged on back of the backside of the van"

527US1 Unit: $U77 [05-02-01 17:48:17] PAGES PGT: OPIN

303Cite as: 527 U. S. 263 (1999)
Opinion of Souter, J.
while "Shy Guy" and "Blonde Girl" hung back. Id., at 43."Mountain Man" approached a pickup truck, then "pounded

on" the front passenger side window of Whitlock's car,"shook and shook the car door," "banging and banging on the
window" while Whitlock checked to see if the door was
locked. Ibid. Finally, "he just really shook it hard and youcould tell he was mad. Shook it really hard and the door

opened and he jumped in . . . and faced her." Id., at 43-44.While Whitlock tried to push him away, "Mountain Man"
"motioned for `Blonde Girl' and `Shy Guy' to come" and thegirl did as she was bidden. She "started to jump into the
car," but "jumped back" when Whitlock stepped on the gas.
Id., at 44. Then "Mountain Man" started "hitting [Whitlock]
on the left shoulder, her right shoulder and then . . . the
head," finally "open[ing] the door again" so "the `Blonde Girl'
got in the back and `Shy Guy' followed and got behind him."
Id., at 45. "Shy Guy" passed "Mountain Man" his tan coat,
which "Mountain Man" "fiddled with" for "what seemed like
a long time," then "sat back up and . . . faced" Whitlock while
"the other two in the back seat sat back and relaxed." Ibid.
Stoltzfus then claimed that she got out of her car and went
over to Whitlock's, whereupon unassertive "Shy Guy" "instinctively jumped, you know, laid over on the seat to hide
from me." Id., at 46. Stoltzfus pulled up next to Whitlock's
car and repeatedly asked, "[A]re you O.K.[?]," but Whitlock
responded only with eye contact; "she didn't smile, there was
no expression," and "[ j]ust very serious, looked down to her
right," suggesting Strickler was holding a weapon on her.
Id., at 46, 47. Finally, Whitlock mouthed something, which
Stoltzfus demonstrated for the jury and then explained she
realized must have been the word, "help." Id., at 47.

Without rejecting the very notion that jurors with discretion in sentencing would be influenced by the relative dominance of one accomplice among others in a shocking crime,
I could not regard Stoltzfus's colorful testimony as anything
but significant on the matter of sentence. It was Stoltzfus

Opinion of Souter, J.
alone who described Strickler as the initiator of the abduc-tion, as the one who broke into Whitlock's car, who beckoned

his companions to follow him, and who violently subdued thevictim while "Shy Guy" sat in the back seat. The bare content of this testimony, important enough, was enhanced by
one of the inherent hallmarks of reliability, as Stoltzfus con-fidently recalled detail after detail. The withheld documents would have shown, however, that many of the detailsStoltzfus confidently mentioned on the stand (such as Strickler's appearance, Whitlock's appearance, the hour of daywhen the episode occurred, and her daughter's alleged notation of the license plate number of Whitlock's car) had apparently escaped her memory in her initial interviews with the
police. Her persuasive account did not come, indeed, until
after her recollection had been aided by further conversations with the police and with the victim's boyfriend. I
therefore have to assess the likely havoc that an informed
cross-examiner could have wreaked upon Stoltzfus as adequate to raise a significant possibility of a different recommendation, as sufficient to undermine confidence that the
death recommendation would have been the choice. All it
would have taken, after all, was one juror to hold out against
death to preclude the recommendation actually given.

The Court does not, of course, deny that evidence of dominant role would probably have been considered by the jury;
the Court, instead, doubts that this consideration, and the
evidence bearing on it, would have figured so prominently in
a juror's mind as to be a fulcrum of confidence. I am not
convinced by the Court's reasons.

The Court emphasizes the brutal manner of the killing and
Strickler's want of remorse as jury considerations diminishing the relative importance of Strickler's position as ringleader. See ante, at 295-296. Without doubt the jurors
considered these to be important factors, and without doubt
they may have been treated as sufficient to warrant death.
But as the Court says, sufficiency of other evidence and the

527US1 Unit: $U77 [05-02-01 17:48:17] PAGES PGT: OPIN

305Cite as: 527 U. S. 263 (1999)
Opinion of Souter, J.
facts it supports is not the Brady standard, and the signifi-cance of both brutality and sangfroid must surely have been

complemented by a certainty that without Strickler therewould have been no abduction and no ensuing murder.

The Court concludes that Stoltzfus's testimony is unlikely
to have had significant influence on the jury's sentencing rec-ommendation because the prosecutor made no mention of her

testimony in his closing statement at the sentencing proceed-ing. See

ante, at 295. But although the Court is entirely
right that the prosecution gave no prominence to the Stoltz-fus testimony at the sentencing stage, the Commonwealth's

closing actually did include two brief references to Strickler's
behavior in "just grabbing a complete stranger and abducting her," 19 Record 919; see also id., at 904, as relevant to
the jury's determination of future dangerousness. And
since Strickler's criminal record had no convictions involving
actual violence, a point defense counsel stressed in his closing argument, see id., at 913, the jurors may well have given
weight to Stoltzfus's lively portrait of Strickler as the aggressive leader of the group when they came to assess his
future dangerousness.

What is more important, common experience, supported
by at least one empirical study, see Bowers, Sandys, &
Steiner, Foreclosed Impartiality in Capital Sentencing: Jurors' Predispositions, Guilt-Trial Experience, and Premature
Decision Making, 83 Cornell L. Rev. 1476, 1486-1496 (1998),
tells us that the evidence and arguments presented during
the guilt phase of a capital trial will often have a significant
effect on the jurors' choice of sentence. True, Stoltzfus's
testimony directly discussed only the circumstances of Whitlock's abduction, but its impact on the jury was almost certainly broader, as the prosecutor recognized. After the jury
rendered its verdict on guilt, for example, the defense moved
for a judgment of acquittal on the capital murder charge
based on insufficiency of the evidence. In the prosecutor's
argument to the court he replied that

527US1 Unit: $U77 [05-02-01 17:48:17] PAGES PGT: OPIN
306 STRICKLER v. GREENE

Opinion of Souter, J.
"the evidence clearly shows that this man was the ag-gressor. He was the one that ran out. He was the one

that grabbed Leanne Whitlock. When she struggledtrying to get away from him . . . , he was the one that
started beating her there in the car. And finally sub-dued her enough to make her drive away from the mall,
so you start with the principle that he is the aggressor."20 Record 15.

Stoltzfus's testimony helped establish the "principle," as theprosecutor put it, that Strickler was "the aggressor," the
dominant figure, in the whole sequence of criminal events,including the murder, not just in the abduction. If the defense could have called Stoltzfus's credibility into question,the jurors' belief that Strickler was the chief aggressor might
have been undermined to the point that at least one of themwould have hesitated to recommend death.

The Court suggests that the jury might have concludedthat Strickler was the leader based on three other pieces of
evidence: Kurt Massie's identification of Strickler as thedriver of Whitlock's car on its way toward the field where
she was killed; Donna Tudor's testimony that Strickler keptthe car the following week; and Tudor's testimony that
Strickler threatened Henderson with a knife later on the eve-ning of the murder. But if we are going to look at other
testimony we cannot stop here. The accuracy of both Mas-sie's and Tudor's testimony was open to question,

4 and all of

it was subject to some evidence that Henderson had taken amajor role in the murder. The Court has quoted the Dis4 Massie's identification was open to some doubt because it occurred at
night as one car passed another on a highway. Moreover, he testified that
he first saw four people in the car, then only three, and that none of the
occupants was black. App. 66-67, 70-73. Tudor, as defense counsel
brought out on cross-examination, testified pursuant to a cooperation
agreement with the government and admitted that the story she told on
the stand was different from what she had told the defense investigator
before trial. Id., at 100-101, 103-104.

Opinion of Souter, J.
trict Court's summation of evidence against him, ante, at 291,n. 36: Henderson's wallet was found near the body, his clothes

were bloody, he presented a woman friend with the victim'swatch at a postmortem celebration (which he left driving the
victim's car), and he confessed to a friend that he had justkilled an unidentified black person. Had this been the totality of the evidence, the jurors could well have had little cer-tainty about who had been in charge. But they could have
had no doubt about the leader if they believed Stoltzfus.Ultimately, I cannot accept the Court's discount of Stoltzfus in the Brady sentencing calculus for the reason I haverepeatedly emphasized, the undeniable narrative force of
what she said. Against this, it does not matter so much thatother witnesses could have placed Strickler at the shopping
mall on the afternoon of the murder, ante, at 293-294, or thatthe Stoltzfus testimony did not directly address the aggravating factors found, ante, at 295. What is important is thather evidence presented a gripping story, see E. Loftus &
J. Doyle, Eyewitness Testimony: Civil and Criminal 5 (3d ed.1997) ("[R]esearch redoundingly proves that the story format
is a powerful key to juror decision making"). Its messagewas that Strickler was the madly energetic leader of two
morally apathetic accomplices, who were passive but for hisdirection. One cannot be reasonably confident that not a
single juror would have had a different perspective after animpeachment that would have destroyed the credibility of
that story. I would accordingly vacate the sentence and re-mand for reconsideration, and to that extent I respectfully
dissent.

GRUPO MEXICANO de DESARROLLO, S. A., et al. v.

ALLIANCE BOND FUND, INC., et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe second circuit

No. 98-231. Argued March 31, 1999--Decided June 17, 1999
Respondent investment funds purchased unsecured notes (Notes) from

petitioner Grupo Mexicano de Desarrollo, S. A. (GMD), a Mexican holding company. Four GMD subsidiaries (also petitioners) guaranteed the
Notes. After GMD fell into financial trouble and missed an interest
payment on the Notes, respondents accelerated the Notes' principal
amount and filed suit for the amount due in Federal District Court.
Alleging that GMD was at risk of insolvency, or already insolvent, that
it was preferring its Mexican creditors by its planned allocation to them
of its most valuable assets, and that these actions would frustrate any
judgment respondents could obtain, respondents requested a preliminary injunction restraining petitioners from transferring the assets.
The court issued the preliminary injunction and ordered respondents to
post a $50,000 bond. The Second Circuit affirmed.

Held:

1. This case has not been rendered moot by the District Court's
granting summary judgment to respondents on their contract claim and
converting the preliminary injunction into a permanent injunction.
Generally, the appeal of a preliminary injunction becomes moot when
the trial court enters a permanent injunction because the former merges
into the latter. Here, however, petitioners' potential cause of action
against the injunction bond for wrongful injunction suffices to preserve
the Court's jurisdiction, since petitioners' argument that the District
Court lacked the power to restrain their use of assets pending a money
judgment is independent of their defense against the money judgment
on the merits. For the same reason, petitioners' failure to appeal the
conversion of the preliminary injunction into a permanent injunction
does not forfeit their claim on the bond. Pp. 313-318.

2. The District Court lacked the authority to issue a preliminary injunction preventing petitioners from disposing of their assets pending
adjudication of respondents' contract claim for money damages because
such a remedy was historically unavailable from a court of equity.
Pp. 318-333.

(a) The federal courts have the equity jurisdiction that was exercised by the English Court of Chancery at the time the Constitution
was adopted and the Judiciary Act of 1789 was enacted. Pp. 318-319.

(b) The well-established general rule was that a judgment fixing
the debt was necessary before a court in equity would interfere with
the debtor's use of his property. See, e. g., Pusey & Jones Co. v. Hanssen, 261 U. S. 491, 497. It is by no means clear that there are any
exceptions to the general rule relevant to this case, and the lower courts
did not address this point. The merger of law and equity did not
change the rule, since the merger did not alter substantive rights. The
rule was regarded as serving not merely the procedural end of assuring
exhaustion of legal remedies, but also the substantive end of giving the
creditor an interest in the property which equity could act upon.
Pp. 319-324.

(c) The postmerger cases of Deckert v. Independence Shares Corp.,
311 U. S. 282, United States v. First Nat. City Bank, 379 U. S. 378, and
De Beers Consol. Mines, Ltd. v. United States, 325 U. S. 212, are entirely
consistent with the view that the preliminary injunction in this case was
beyond the District Court's equitable power. Pp. 324-327.

(d) The English Court of Chancery did not provide a prejudgment
injunctive remedy until 1975, and the decision doing so has been viewed
by commentators as a dramatic departure from prior practice. Enjoining the debtor's disposition of his property at the instance of a nonjudgment creditor is incompatible with this Court's traditionally cautious
approach to equitable powers, which leaves any substantial expansion
of past practice to Congress. Pp. 327-329.

(e) The various weighty considerations both for and against creating the remedy at issue here should be resolved not in this forum, but
in Congress. Pp. 329-333.

Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case presents the question whether, in an action formoney damages, a United States District Court has the

power to issue a preliminary injunction preventing the de-fendant from transferring assets in which no lien or equitable
interest is claimed. I

Petitioner Grupo Mexicano de Desarrollo, S. A. (GMD), isa Mexican holding company. In February 1994, GMD issued
$250 million of 8.25% unsecured, guaranteed notes due in2001 (Notes), which ranked pari passu in priority of payment
with all of GMD's other unsecured and unsubordinated debt.Interest payments were due in February and August of
every year. Four subsidiaries of GMD (which are the re-maining petitioners) guaranteed the Notes. Respondents
are investment funds which purchased approximately $75million of the Notes.

Between 1990 and 1994, GMD was involved in a toll roadconstruction program sponsored by the Government of Mexico. In order to elicit private financing, the Mexican Gov-ernment granted concessions to companies that would build
and operate the system of toll roads. GMD was both aninvestor in the concessionaries and among the construction
companies hired by the concessionaries to build the toll

Opinion of the Court
roads. Problems in the Mexican economy resulted in severe
losses for the concessionaries, who were therefore unable to
pay contractors like GMD. In response to these problems,
in 1997, the Mexican Government announced the Toll Road
Rescue Program, under which it would issue guaranteed
notes (Toll Road Notes) to the concessionaries, in exchange
for their ceding to the Government ownership of the toll
roads. The Toll Road Notes were to be used to pay the bank
debt of the concessionaries, and also to pay outstanding receivables held by GMD and other contractors for services
rendered to the concessionaries (Toll Road Receivables). In
the fall of 1997, GMD announced that it expected to receive
approximately $309 million of Toll Road Notes under the
program.

Because of the downturn in the Mexican economy and the
related difficulties in the toll road program, by mid-1997
GMD was in serious financial trouble. In addition to the
Notes, GMD owed other debts of about $450 million. GMD's
1997 Form 20-F, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 30, 1997, stated that GMD's current liabilities exceeded its current assets and that there was
"substantial doubt" whether it could continue as a going concern. As a result of these financial problems, neither GMD
nor its subsidiaries (who had guaranteed payment) made the
August 1997 interest payment on the Notes.

Between August and December 1997, GMD attempted to
negotiate a restructuring of its debt with its creditors. On
August 26, Reuters reported that GMD was negotiating with
the Mexican banks to reduce its $256 million bank debt, and
that it planned to deal with this liability before negotiating
with the investors owning the Notes. On October 28, GMD
publicly announced that it would place in trust its right to

Government (apparently to pay back taxes). GMD also negotiated with the holders of the Notes (including respondents) to restructure that debt, but by December these negotiations had failed.

On December 11, respondents accelerated the principal
amount of their Notes, and, on December 12, filed suit for
the amount due in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York (petitioners had consented to
personal jurisdiction in that forum). The complaint alleged
that "GMD is at risk of insolvency, if not insolvent already";
that GMD was dissipating its most significant asset, the Toll
Road Notes, and was preferring its Mexican creditors by its
planned allocation of Toll Road Notes to the payment of their
claims, and by its transfer to them of Toll Road Receivables;
and that these actions would "frustrate any judgment" respondents could obtain. App. 29-30. Respondents sought
breach-of-contract damages of $80.9 million, and requested a
preliminary injunction restraining petitioners from transferring the Toll Road Notes or Receivables. On that same day,
the District Court entered a temporary restraining order
preventing petitioners from transferring their right to receive the Toll Road Notes.

On December 23, the District Court entered an order in
which it found that "GMD is at risk of insolvency if not already insolvent"; that the Toll Road Notes were GMD's "only
substantial asset"; that GMD planned to use the Toll Road
Notes "to satisfy its Mexican creditors to the exclusion of
[respondents] and other holders of the Notes"; that "[i]n light
of [petitioners'] financial condition and dissipation of assets,
any judgment [respondents] obtain in this action will be frustrated"; that respondents had demonstrated irreparable injury; and that it was "almost certain" that respondents would
succeed on the merits of their claim. App. to Pet. for Cert.

Respondents contend that events subsequent to petition-ers' appeal of the preliminary injunction render this case

moot. While that appeal was pending in the Second Circuit,the case proceeded in the District Court. Petitioners filed
an answer and asserted various counterclaims. On April 17,1998, the District Court granted summary judgment to respondents on their contract claim and dismissed petitioners'counterclaims. The court ordered petitioners to pay respondents $82,444,259 by assignment or transfer of Toll RoadReceivables or Toll Road Notes; the court also converted the
preliminary injunction into a permanent injunction pendingsuch assignment or transfer. Although petitioners initially
appealed both portions of this order to the Second Circuit,they later abandoned their appeal from the permanent injunction. The appeal from the payment order is still pend-ing in the Second Circuit. The same date the District Court
entered judgment, respondents moved to dismiss petitioners'first appeal--the one now before us--arguing that the final
judgment rendered the appeal moot. On May 4, the SecondCircuit denied the motion to dismiss and two days later affirmed, as mentioned above, the District Court's grant of thepreliminary injunction.

Respondents argue that the issue of the propriety of thepreliminary injunction is moot because that injunction is now
merged into the permanent injunction. Petitioners contendthat the case is not moot because, if we hold that the District
Court was without power to issue the preliminary injunction,

Opinion of the Court

then under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 65(c) and 65.11they will have a claim against the injunction bond. They

assert that the injunction "interfered with GMD's effortsto restructure its debt and substantially impaired GMD's
ability to continue its operations in the ordinary course ofbusiness." Brief for Petitioners 7. Respondents concede
that a party who has been wrongfully enjoined has a claimon the bond, but they argue that although such a claim might
mean that the case is not moot, it does not prevent this interlocutory appeal from becoming moot. In any event, sayrespondents, because a claim for wrongful injunction requires that the enjoined party win on the ultimate merits,
petitioners have forfeited any claim by failing to appeal theportion of the District Court's judgment converting the preliminary injunction into a permanent injunction.Generally, an appeal from the grant of a preliminary injunction becomes moot when the trial court enters a perma-nent injunction, because the former merges into the latter.
We have dismissed appeals in such circumstances. See, e. g.,
Smith v. Illinois Bell Telephone Co., 270 U. S. 587, 588-589
(1926). We agree with petitioners, however, that their potential cause of action against the injunction bond preservesour jurisdiction over this appeal. Cf.

Liner v. Jafco, Inc.,
375 U. S. 301, 305-306 (1964).In the case of the usual preliminary injunction, the plaintiff seeks to enjoin, pending the outcome of the litigation,action that he claims is unlawful. If his lawsuit turns out to
be meritorious--if he is found to be entitled to the perma-nent injunction that he seeks--even if the preliminary injunction was wrongly issued (because at that stage of the

1 Rule 65(c) provides that an applicant for a preliminary injunction must
obtain security "for the payment of such costs and damages as may be
incurred or suffered by any party who is found to have been wrongfully
enjoined or restrained." Rule 65.1 states in part that "[t]he surety's liability may be enforced on motion without the necessity of an independent action."

Opinion of the Court
litigation the plaintiff 's prospects of winning were not suffi-ciently clear, or the plaintiff was not suffering irreparable

injury) its issuance would in any event be harmless error.The final injunction establishes that the defendant should
not have been engaging in the conduct that was enjoined.Hence, it is reasonable to regard the preliminary injunction
as merging into the final one: If the latter is valid, the formeris, if not procedurally correct, at least harmless. A quite
different situation obtains in the present case, where (accord-ing to petitioners' claim) the substantive validity of the final
injunction does not establish the substantive validity of thepreliminary one. For the latter was issued not to enjoin

unlawful conduct, but rather to render unlawful conduct thatwould otherwise be permissible, in order to protect the anticipated judgment of the court; and it is the essence of petition-ers' claim that such an injunction can be issued only after
the judgment is rendered. If petitioners are correct, theyhave been harmed by issuance of the unauthorized preliminary injunction--and hence should be able to recover on thebond--

even if the final injunction is proper. It would makeno sense, when this is the claim, to say that the preliminary

injunction merges into the final one.2

2 We recognize that respondents alleged in their complaint that the assignments of the rights to receive Toll Road Notes violated the negative
pledge clause of the note instrument and the provision that the Notes
ranked pari passu with other debt, and therefore that petitioners were
not entitled to engage in the restrained conduct. We do not, however,
understand the District Court to have made a finding--either in the preliminary injunction order or in the final order--that petitioners' enjoined
conduct was unlawful. The mootness of petitioners' claim at the present
stage of the proceedings must be assessed on the basis of what that claim
is. As shown by the question on which we granted certiorari, it is that
the District Court wrongfully entered an order to protect its judgment
before the judgment was rendered. If, in fact, petitioners had no right
under the note instrument to take the actions that were enjoined, that
would presumably be a defense to the action on the injunction bond. See,
e. g., Blumenthal v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., 910 F. 2d

Opinion of the Court

We reject respondents' argument that the controversy
over the bond saves the "case" from mootness, but does not
save the "issue" of the validity of the preliminary injunction
from mootness. University of Texas v. Camenisch, 451 U. S.
390 (1981), upon which respondents principally rely, is inapposite. In that case a deaf graduate student sued the University of Texas to obtain an injunction requiring the school
to pay for a sign-language interpreter for his school work.
The District Court granted a preliminary injunction and
required the student to post an injunction bond. Pending
appeal of that injunction, the university paid for the interpreter, but the student graduated before the Court
of Appeals issued its decision. Nevertheless, the Court of
Appeals held that the appeal of the preliminary injunction
was not moot because the issue of who had to pay for the
interpreter remained. We reversed:

"The Court of Appeals correctly held that the case as
a whole is not moot, since, as that court noted, it remains
to be decided who should ultimately bear the cost of the
interpreter. However, the issue before the Court of
Appeals was not who should pay for the interpreter, but
rather whether the District Court had abused its discretion in issuing a preliminary injunction requiring the
University to pay for him. The two issues are significantly different, since whether the preliminary injunction should have issued depended on the balance of factors listed in [Fifth Circuit precedent], while whether

the University should ultimately bear the cost of the
interpreter depends on a final resolution of the merits
of Camenisch's case.

tions Under Rule 65(c), 99 Harv. L. Rev. 828, 836 (1986). But it does not
bear upon the mootness of petitioners' present claim.

Opinion of the Court
"This, then, is simply another instance in which oneissue in a case has become moot, but the case as a whole

remains alive because other issues have not becomemoot. . . . Because the only issue presently before us--
the correctness of the decision to grant a preliminaryinjunction--is moot, the judgment of the Court of Appeals must be vacated and the case must be remandedto the District Court for trial on the merits."

Id., at393-394 (citations omitted).

Camenisch is simply an application of the same principlewhich underlies the rule that a preliminary injunction ordinarily merges into the final injunction. Since the prelimi-nary injunction no longer had any effect (the student had
graduated), and since the substantive issue governing thepropriety of what had been paid under the preliminary injunction (as opposed to the procedural issue of whether theinjunction should have issued when it did) was the same
issue underlying the merits claim, there was no sense in try-ing the preliminary injunction question separately. In the
present case, however, petitioners' basis for arguing that thepreliminary injunction was wrongfully issued--which is that
the District Court lacked the power to restrain their use ofassets pending a money judgment--is independent of respondents' claim on the merits--which is that petitionersbreached the note instrument by failing to make the August
1997 interest payment. The resolution of the merits is im-material to the validity of petitioners' potential claim on the
bond. Cf. American Can Co. v. Mansukhani, 742 F. 2d 314,320-321 (CA7 1984); Stacey G. v. Pasadena Independent Sch.
Dist., 695 F. 2d 949, 955 (CA5 1983).For the same reason, petitioners' failure to appeal the
permanent injunction does not forfeit their claim that thepreliminary injunction was wrongful. Petitioners do not
contest the District Court's power to issue a permanentinjunction after rendering a money judgment against them,

Opinion of the Court

but they do contest its power to issue a preliminary injunc-tion, and they do so on a ground that has nothing to do with

the validity of the permanent injunction. And again for thesame reason, we reject respondents' argument that petitioners have no wrongful injunction claim because they lost thecase on the merits.

III
We turn, then, to the merits question whether the DistrictCourt had authority to issue the preliminary injunction in

this case pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65.3The Judiciary Act of 1789 conferred on the federal courts
jurisdiction over "all suits . . . in equity." $ 11, 1 Stat. 78.We have long held that "[t]he `jurisdiction' thus conferred . . .
is an authority to administer in equity suits the principles ofthe system of judicial remedies which had been devised and
was being administered by the English Court of Chanceryat the time of the separation of the two countries." Atlas

3 Although this is a diversity case, respondents' complaint sought the
injunction pursuant to Rule 65, and the Second Circuit's decision was
based on that rule and on federal equity principles. Petitioners argue for
the first time before this Court that under Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304
U. S. 64 (1938), the availability of this injunction under Rule 65 should be
determined by the law of the forum State (in this case New York). Because this argument was neither raised nor considered below, we decline
to consider it.

equity jurisdiction." 11A C. Wright, A. Miller, & M. Kane,Federal Practice and Procedure $ 2941, p. 31 (2d ed. 1995).
We must ask, therefore, whether the relief respondents re-quested here was traditionally accorded by courts of equity.

A
Respondents do not even argue this point. The UnitedStates as

amicus curiae, however, contends that the prelimi-nary injunction issued in this case is analogous to the relief

obtained in the equitable action known as a "creditor's bill."This remedy was used (among other purposes) to permit a
judgment creditor to discover the debtor's assets, to reachequitable interests not subject to execution at law, and to
set aside fraudulent conveyances. See 1 D. Dobbs, Law ofRemedies $ 2.8(1), pp. 191-192 (2d ed. 1993); 4 S. Symons,
Pomeroy's Equity Jurisprudence $ 1415, pp. 1065-1066 (5thed. 1941); 1 G. Glenn, Fraudulent Conveyances and Preferences $ 26, p. 51 (rev. ed. 1940). It was well established,however, that, as a general rule, a creditor's bill could be
brought only by a creditor who had already obtained a judg-ment establishing the debt. See,

e. g., Pusey & Jones Co. v.
Hanssen, 261 U. S. 491, 497 (1923); Hollins v. BrierfieldCoal & Iron Co., 150 U. S. 371, 378-379 (1893); Cates v. Allen,

had to be exhausted before equitable remedies could be pur-sued, but also of the substantive rule that a general creditor
(one without a judgment) had no cognizable interest, either

he has no right to interfere, and it would lead to an unneces-sary, and, perhaps, a fruitless and oppressive interruption of
the exercise of the debtor's rights." Wiggins v. Armstrong,2 Johns. Ch. 144, 145-146 (N. Y. 1816). See also,

at 11; Wait, supra, $ 52, at 81, $ 73, at 113.The United States asserts that there were exceptions
to the general rule requiring a judgment. The existenceand scope of these exceptions is by no means clear.

4 Cf.

G. Glenn, The Rights and Remedies of Creditors Respect-ing Their Debtor's Property $$ 21-24, pp. 18-21 (1915). Although the United States says that some of them "mighthave been relevant in a case like this one," Brief for United
States as Amicus Curiae 11, it chooses not to resolve (orargue definitively) whether any particular one would have
been, id., at 12.5 For their part, as noted above, respondents

4 For example, some courts said that insolvency was an exception, but
others disagreed. See, e. g., Annot., Of the Demands Which Will Support
a Creditor's Bill, 66 American State Reports 271, 285 (1899) (cases are "in
almost hopeless conflict"). This Court has concluded that that particular
exception does not exist. See, e. g., Pusey & Jones Co. v. Hanssen, 261
U. S. 491, 495-497 (1923); Hollins v. Brierfield Coal & Iron Co., 150 U. S.
371, 385-386 (1893); Smith v. Railroad Co., 99 U. S. 398, 400-401 (1879).

5 Some cases suggested that there was an exception where the debt was

admitted or confessed, at least if the creditor possessed an interest in the
debtor's property. See, e. g., Scott v. Neely, 140 U. S. 106, 113 (1891); D. A.
Tompkins Co. v. Catawba Mills, 82 F. 780, 783 (CCSC 1897). Even if the
latter condition is overlooked, it is by no means clear that the action here
would qualify. Petitioners' answer (filed after the preliminary injunction
had issued) denied knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief
(which is the equivalent of a denial, see Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
8(b)) as to respondents' allegations that petitioners were currently in527US1 Unit: $U78 [05-09-01 12:58:54] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
do not discuss creditor's bills at all. Particularly in theabsence of any discussion of this point by the lower courts,

we are not inclined to speculate upon the existence or appli-cability to this case of any exceptions, and follow the wellestablished general rule that a judgment establishing thedebt was necessary before a court of equity would interfere
with the debtor's use of his property.

Justice Ginsburg concedes that federal equity courtshave traditionally rejected the type of provisional relief

granted in this case. See post, at 338 (opinion concurringin part and dissenting in part). She invokes, however, "the
grand aims of equity," and asserts a general power to grantrelief whenever legal remedies are not "practical and efficient," unless there is a statute to the contrary. Post, at 342(internal quotation marks omitted). This expansive view of
equity must be rejected. Joseph Story's famous treatise re-flects what we consider the proper rule, both with regard to
the general role of equity in our "government of laws, not ofmen," and with regard to its application in the very case
before us:

"Mr. Justice Blackstone has taken considerable painsto refute this doctrine. `It is said,' he remarks, `that it

is the business of a Court of Equity, in England, to abatethe rigor of the common law. But no such power is contended for. Hard was the case of bond creditors, whosedebtor devised away his real estate . . . . But a Court
of Equity can give no relief . . . .' And illustrations ofthe same character may be found in every state of the
Union. . . . In many [States], if not in all, a debtor mayprefer one creditor to another, in discharging his debts,
whose assets are wholly insufficient to pay all the
debted to respondents in the amount of $80.9 million, and that petitioners
breached their agreements under the Notes and the related guarantee;
and denied respondents' allegations that all conditions precedent to suit
had occurred, been waived, or otherwise been satisfied, and that respondents had suffered damages of $80.9 million.

debts." 1 Commentaries on Equity Jurisprudence $ 12,pp. 14-15 (1836).

See also infra, at 332-333. We do not question the propo-sition that equity is flexible; but in the federal system, at
least, that flexibility is confined within the broad bound-aries of traditional equitable relief. To accord a type of
relief that has never been available before--and especially(as here) a type of relief that has been specifically disclaimed
by longstanding judicial precedent--is to invoke a "defaultrule,"

post, at 342, not of flexibility but of omnipotence.When there are indeed new conditions that might call for a

wrenching departure from past practice, Congress is in amuch better position than we both to perceive them and
to design the appropriate remedy. Despite Justice Ginsburg's allusion to the "increasing complexities of modernbusiness relations,"

post, at 337 (internal quotation marksomitted), and to the bygone "age of slow-moving capital and

comparatively immobile wealth," post, at 338, we suspectthere is absolutely nothing new about debtors' trying to
avoid paying their debts, or seeking to favor some credi-tors over others--or even about their seeking to achieve
these ends through "sophisticated . . . strategies," ibid. Thelaw of fraudulent conveyances and bankruptcy was developed to prevent such conduct; an equitable power to restricta debtor's use of his unencumbered property before judgment was not.Respondents argue (supported by the United States) that
the merger of law and equity changed the rule that a generalcreditor could not interfere with the debtor's use of his property. But the merger did not alter substantive rights."Notwithstanding the fusion of law and equity by the Rules
of Civil Procedure, the substantive principles of Courts ofChancery remain unaffected."

not be inclined to believe that it is merely a question ofprocedure whether a person's unencumbered assets can be

Opinion of the Court
frozen by general-creditor claimants before their claims havebeen vindicated by judgment. It seems to us that question

goes to the substantive rights of all property owners. Inany event it appears, as we have observed, that the rule requiring a judgment was historically regarded as serving, notmerely the procedural end of assuring exhaustion of legal
remedies (which the merger of law and equity could renderirrelevant), but also the substantive end of giving the creditor an interest in the property which equity could then actupon. See

supra, at 319-320.6We note that none of the parties or amici specifically

raised the applicability to this case of Federal Rule of CivilProcedure 18(b), which states:

"Whenever a claim is one heretofore cognizable onlyafter another claim has been prosecuted to a conclusion,
the two claims may be joined in a single action; but thecourt shall grant relief in that action only in accordance
with the relative substantive rights of the parties. Inparticular, a plaintiff may state a claim for money and a
claim to have set aside a conveyance fraudulent as to
that plaintiff, without first having obtained a judgmentestablishing the claim for money."

6 As we stated in Adler v. Fenton, 24 How. 407, 411-412 (1861): " `Our
laws determine with accuracy the time and manner in which the property
of a debtor ceases to be subject to his disposition, and becomes subject to
the rights of his creditor. A creditor acquires a lien upon the lands of his
debtor by a judgment; and upon the personal goods of the debtor, by the
delivery of an execution to the sheriff. It is only by these liens that a
creditor has any vested or specific right in the property of his debtor.
Before these liens are acquired, the debtor has full dominion over his property; he may convert one species of property into another, and he may
alienate to a purchaser. The rights of the debtor, and those of a creditor,
are thus defined by positive rules; and the points at which the power of
the debtor ceases, and the right of the creditor commences, are clearly
established. These regulations cannot be contravened or varied by any
interposition of equity' " (quoting Moran v. Dawes, 1 Hopk. Ch. 365, 367
(N. Y. 1825)).

Opinion of the Court

Because the Rule was neither mentioned by the lower courtsnor briefed by the parties, we decline to consider its application to the present case. We note, however, that it saysnothing about preliminary relief, and specifically reserves
substantive rights (as did the Rules Enabling Act, see 28U. S. C. $ 2072(b)).

Respondents contend that two of our postmerger cases
support the District Court's order "in principle." Brief forRespondents 22. We find both of these cases entirely consistent with the view that the preliminary injunction in this
case was beyond the equitable authority of the DistrictCourt.

In Deckert v. Independence Shares Corp., 311 U. S. 282(1940), purchasers of certificates that entitled the holders to
invest in a trust of common stocks sued the company thatsold the certificates and the company administering the
trust, and related officers and affiliates, under the SecuritiesAct of 1933, alleging that the sale was fraudulent. They further alleged that the company that sold the certificates was
insolvent, that it was likely to make preferential paymentsto certain creditors, and that its assets were in danger of

dissipation. They sought the appointment of a receiver andan injunction restraining the company administering the
trust from transferring any assets of the corporations or ofthe trust. The District Court preliminarily enjoined the
company from transferring a fixed sum. Id., at 285-286.

7 Several States have adopted the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act
(or its successor the Uniform Fraudulent Transfers Act), which has been
interpreted as conferring on a nonjudgment creditor the right to bring a
fraudulent conveyance claim. See generally P. Alces, Law of Fraudulent
Transactions || 5.04[3], p. 5-116 (1989). Insofar as Rule 18(b) applies to
such an action, the state statute eliminating the need for a judgment may
have altered the common-law rule that a general contract creditor has no
interest in his debtor's property. Because this case does not involve a
claim of fraudulent conveyance, we express no opinion on the point.

Opinion of the Court
After deciding that the Securities Act permitted equitable
relief, we concluded that the bill stated a cause of action for
the equitable remedies of rescission of the contracts and restitution of the consideration paid, id., at 287-288, and that
the preliminary injunction "was a reasonable measure to preserve the status quo pending final determination of the questions raised by the bill," id., at 290. Deckert is not on point
here because, as the Court took pains to explain, "the bill
state[d] a cause [of action] for equitable relief." Id., at 288.

"The principal objects of the suit are rescission of the
Savings Plan contracts and restitution of the consideration paid . . . . That a suit to rescind a contract induced
by fraud and to recover the consideration paid may
be maintained in equity, at least where there are circumstances making the legal remedy inadequate, is well
established." Id., at 289.

The preliminary relief available in a suit seeking equitable
relief has nothing to do with the preliminary relief available
in a creditor's bill seeking equitable assistance in the collection of a legal debt.

In the second case relied on by respondents, United States
v. First Nat. City Bank, 379 U. S. 378 (1965), the United
States, in its suit to enforce a tax assessment and tax lien,
requested a preliminary injunction preventing a third-party
bank from transferring any of the taxpayer's assets which
were held in a foreign branch office of the bank. Id., at 379-
380. Relying on a statute giving district courts the power
to grant injunctions " `necessary or appropriate for the enforcement of the internal revenue laws,' " id., at 380 (quoting
former 26 U. S. C. $ 7402(a) (1964 ed.)), we concluded that the
temporary injunction was "appropriate to prevent further
dissipation of assets," 379 U. S., at 385. We stated that if
a district court could not issue such an injunction, foreign
taxpayers could avoid their tax obligations.

Opinion of the Court

First National is distinguishable from the present case ona number of grounds. First, of course, it involved not the

Court's general equitable powers under the Judiciary Act of1789, but its powers under the statute authorizing issuance
of tax injunctions.8 Second, First National relied in part
on the doctrine that courts of equity will " `go much farther
both to give and withhold relief in furtherance of the public
interest than they are accustomed to go when only private
interests are involved,' " id., at 383 (quoting Virginian R. Co.
v. Railway Employees, 300 U. S. 515, 552 (1937)). And finally, although the Court did not rely on this fact, the creditor (the Government) asserted an equitable lien on the property, see 379 U. S., at 379-380, which presents a different
case from that of the unsecured general creditor.

That Deckert and First National should not be read as
establishing the principle relied on by respondents is
strongly suggested by De Beers Consol. Mines, Ltd. v.
United States, 325 U. S. 212 (1945). In that case the United
States brought suit against several corporations seeking
equitable relief against alleged antitrust violations. The
United States also sought a preliminary injunction restraining the defendants from removing their assets from this
country pending adjudication of the merits. We concluded
that the injunction was beyond the power of the District
Court. We stated that "[a] preliminary injunction is always
appropriate to grant intermediate relief of the same character as that which may be granted finally," but that the injunction in that case dealt "with a matter lying wholly out8 Although the United States suggests that there is statutory support
for the present injunction in the All Writs Act, 28 U. S. C. $ 1651, Brief for

usage, and what are the principles of equity applicable in such a case."
De Beers Consol. Mines, Ltd. v. United States, 325 U. S. 212, 219 (1945).

side the issues in the suit." Id., at 220. We pointed outthat "Federal and State courts appear consistently to have

refused relief of the nature here sought," id., at 221, andwe concluded:

"To sustain the challenged order would create a prece-dent of sweeping effect. This suit, as we have said, is
not to be distinguished from any other suit in equity.What applies to it applies to all such. Every suitor who
resorts to chancery for any sort of relief by injunctionmay, on a mere statement of belief that the defendant can easily make away with or transport his moneyor goods, impose an injunction on him, indefinite in
duration, disabling him to use so much of his funds orproperty as the court deems necessary for security or
compliance with its possible decree. And, if so, it is dif-ficult to see why a plaintiff in any action for a personal
judgment in tort or contract may not, also, apply to thechancellor for a so-called injunction sequestrating his
opponent's assets pending recovery and satisfaction ofa judgment in such a law action. No relief of this character has been thought justified in the long history ofequity jurisprudence."

Id., at 222-223.

The statements in the last two sentences, though dictum,confirms that the relief sought by respondents does not have

a basis in the traditional powers of equity courts.

C
As further support for the proposition that the relief ac-corded here was unknown to traditional equity practice, it is

instructive that the English Court of Chancery, from whichthe First Congress borrowed in conferring equitable powers
on the federal courts, did not provide an injunctive remedysuch as this until 1975. In that year, the Court of Appeal
decided Mareva Compania Naviera S. A. v. International

Opinion of the Court

Bulkcarriers S. A., 2 Lloyd's Rep. 509.9 Mareva, althoughacknowledging that the prior case of Lister & Co. v. Stubbs,

[1890] 45 Ch. D. 1 (C. A.), said that a court has no power toprotect a creditor before he gets judgment,

10 relied on a statute giving courts the authority to grant an interlocutory in-junction " `in all cases in which it shall appear to the court

to be just or convenient,' " 2 Lloyd's Rep., at 510 (quotingJudicature Act of 1925, Law Reports 1925 (2), 15 & 16 Geo.
V, ch. 49, $ 45). It held (in the words of Lord Denning) that"[i]f it appears that the debt is due and owing--and there is
a danger that the debtor may dispose of his assets so as todefeat it before judgment--the Court has jurisdiction in a
proper case to grant an interlocutory judgment so as to prevent him [sic] disposing of those assets." 2 Lloyd's Rep.,
at 510. The Mareva injunction has now been confirmed bystatute. See Supreme Court Act of 1981, $ 37, 11 Halsbury's

Statutes 966, 1001 (1991 reissue).Commentators have emphasized that the adoption of
Mareva injunctions was a dramatic departure from priorpractice.

"Before 1975 the courts would not grant an injunctionto restrain a defendant from disposing of his assets pen9 Apparently the first "Mareva" injunction was actually issued in Nippon Yusen Kaisha v. Karageorgis, [1975] 2 Lloyd's Rep. 137 (C. A.), in
which Lord Denning recognized the prior practice of not granting such
injunctions, but stated that "the time has come when we should revise our
practice." Id., at 138; see also Hetherington, Introduction to the Mareva
Injunction, in Mareva Injunctions 1, n. 1 (M. Hetherington ed. 1983). For
whatever reason, Mareva has gotten the credit (or blame), and we follow
the tradition of leaving Nippon Yusen in the shadows.

10 In Lister & Co. v. Stubbs, 45 Ch. D., at 1, 13, the Court of Appeal held

that an injunction restraining the defendant's use of assets could not be
issued. Lord Justice Cotton stated: "I know of no case where, because it
was highly probable that if the action were brought to a hearing the plaintiff could establish that a debt was due to him from the defendant, the
defendant has been ordered to give security until that has been established by the judgment or decree."

dente lite merely because the plaintiff feared that bythe time he obtained judgment the defendant would

have no assets against which execution could be levied.Applications for such injunctions were consistently refused in the English Commercial Court as elsewhere.
They were thought to be so clearly beyond the powers ofthe court as to be `wholly unarguable.' " Hetherington,

supra n. 9, at 3.
See also Wasserman, Equity Renewed: Preliminary Injunc-tions to Secure Potential Money Judgments, 67 Wash. L. Rev.

257, 337 (1992) (stating that Mareva "revolutionized English
practice"). The Mareva injunction has been recognized asa powerful tool for general creditors; indeed, it has been

called the "nuclear weapo[n] of the law." R. Ough & W.Flenley, The Mareva Injunction and Anton Piller Order:
Practice and Precedents xi (2d ed. 1993).The parties debate whether

Mareva was based on statutory authority or on inherent equitable power. See Brieffor Petitioners 17, n. 8; Brief for Respondents 35-36. Regardless of the answer to this question, it is indisputable that
the English courts of equity did not actually exercise thispower until 1975, and that federal courts in this country have

traditionally applied the principle that courts of equity willnot, as a general matter, interfere with the debtor's disposition of his property at the instance of a nonjudgment credi-tor. We think it incompatible with our traditionally cautious
approach to equitable powers, which leaves any substantialexpansion of past practice to Congress, to decree the elimination of this significant protection for debtors.

The parties and amici discuss various arguments for and
against creating the preliminary injunctive remedy at issue
in this case. The United States suggests that the factors
supporting such a remedy include

Opinion of the Court

"simplicity and uniformity of procedure; preservation ofthe court's ability to render a judgment that will prove

enforceable; prevention of inequitable conduct on thepart of defendants; avoiding disparities between defendants that have assets within the jurisdiction (whichwould be subject to pre-judgment attachment `at law')
and those that do not; avoiding the necessity for plain-tiffs to locate a forum in which the defendant has substantial assets; and, in an age of easy global mobility ofcapital, preserving the attractiveness of the United
States as a center for financial transactions." Brief forUnited States as

Amicus Curiae 16.

But there are weighty considerations on the other side aswell, the most significant of which is the historical principle

that before judgment (or its equivalent) an unsecured credi-tor has no rights at law or in equity in the property of his
debtor. As one treatise writer explained:

"A rule of procedure which allowed any prowling credi-tor, before his claim was definitely established by judgment, and without reference to the character of hisdemand, to file a bill to discover assets, or to impeach
transfers, or interfere with the business affairs of thealleged debtor, would manifestly be susceptible of the
grossest abuse. A more powerful weapon of oppres-sion could not be placed at the disposal of unscrupulous litigants." Wait, Fraudulent Conveyances $ 73, at110-111.

The requirement that the creditor obtain a prior judgmentis a fundamental protection in debtor-creditor law--rendered
all the more important in our federal system by the debtor'sright to a jury trial on the legal claim. There are other factors which likewise give us pause: The remedy sought herecould render Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 64, which authorizes use of state prejudgment remedies, a virtual irrele-vance. Why go through the trouble of complying with local

Opinion of the Court
attachment and garnishment statutes when this all-purposeprejudgment injunction is available? More importantly,

by adding, through judicial fiat, a new and powerful weaponto the creditor's arsenal, the new rule could radically alter

the balance between debtor's and creditor's rights which
has been developed over centuries through many laws--including those relating to bankruptcy, fraudulent conveyances, and preferences. Because any rational creditorwould want to protect his investment, such a remedy might
induce creditors to engage in a "race to the courthouse" incases involving insolvent or near-insolvent debtors, which
might prove financially fatal to the struggling debtor. (Inthis case, we might observe, the respondents did not represent all of the holders of the Notes; they were an active few
who sought to benefit at the expense of the other noteholdersas well as GMD's other creditors.

11) It is significant that, in

England, use of the Mareva injunction has expanded rapidly.
"Since 1975, the English courts have awarded Mareva injunctions to freeze assets in an ever-increasing set of circumstances both within and beyond the commercial setting

to an ever-expanding number of plaintiffs." Wasserman,
supra, at 339. As early as 1984, one observer stated
that "[t]here are now a steady flow of such applications to
our Courts which have been estimated to exceed one thou11 Justice Ginsburg suggests that respondents acted to benefit all of
GMD's creditors. See post, at 341, n. 6. But respondents' complaint
sought the full amount they were allegedly owed, despite their contention
that petitioners could not pay all their creditors. It is not clear that the
"trust in compliance with Mexican law" that respondents proposed as a
possible preliminary remedy, ibid., was to be for the benefit of all creditors, rather than respondents alone--but that remedy was in any event
denied, which did not deter respondents from seeking a simple freeze on
assets to satisfy their anticipated judgment. There is nothing whatever
wrong with respondents' pursuing their own interests. Indeed, the fact
that it is entirely proper and entirely predictable is the very premise of
the point we are making: that this new remedy will promote unregulated
competition among the creditors of a struggling debtor.

We do not decide which side has the better of these arguments. We set them forth only to demonstrate that resolving them in this forum is incompatible with the democratic
and self-deprecating judgment we have long since made: that
the equitable powers conferred by the Judiciary Act of 1789
did not include the power to create remedies previously unknown to equity jurisprudence. Even when sitting as a
court in equity, we have no authority to craft a "nuclear
weapon" of the law like the one advocated here. Joseph
Story made the point many years ago:

"If, indeed, a Court of Equity in England did possess the
unbounded jurisdiction, which has been thus generally
ascribed to it, of correcting, controlling, moderating, and
even superceding the law, and of enforcing all the rights,
as well as charities, arising from natural law and justice,
and of freeing itself from all regard to former rules and
precedents, it would be the most gigantic in its sway,
and the most formidable instrument of arbitrary power,
that could well be devised. It would literally place the
whole rights and property of the community under the
arbitrary will of the Judge, acting, if you please, arbitrio
boni judicis, and it may be, ex aequo et bono, according
to his own notions and conscience; but still acting with a
despotic and sovereign authority. A Court of Chancery
might then well deserve the spirited rebuke of Seldon;
`For law we have a measure, and know what to trust
to--Equity is according to the conscience of him, that is
Chancellor; and as that is larger, or narrower, so is Equity. 'T is all one, as if they should make the standard
for the measure the Chancellor's foot. What an uncertain measure would this be? One Chancellor has a long
foot; another a short foot; a third an indifferent foot. It

is the same thing with the Chancellor's conscience.' " 1Commentaries on Equity Jurisprudence $ 19, at 21.

The debate concerning this formidable power over debtorsshould be conducted and resolved where such issues belong
in our democracy: in the Congress.

* * *Because such a remedy was historically unavailable from

a court of equity, we hold that the District Court had noauthority to issue a preliminary injunction preventing petitioners from disposing of their assets pending adjudica-tion of respondents' contract claim for money damages. We
reverse the judgment of the Second Circuit and remandthe case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Uncontested evidence presented to the District Court atthe preliminary injunction hearing showed that petitioner

Grupo Mexicano de Desarrollo, S. A. (GMD), had defaulted onits contractual obligations to respondents, a group of GMD
noteholders (Alliance), see App. to Pet. for Cert. 24a, 31a,that Alliance had satisfied all conditions precedent to its
breach of contract claim, see id., at 25a, and that GMD hadno plausible defense on the merits, see id., at 25a, 36a. Alliance also demonstrated that GMD had undertaken to treatAlliance's claims on the same footing as all other unsecured,
unsubordinated debt, see id., at 24a, but that GMD was infact satisfying Mexican creditors to the exclusion of Alliance,
id., at 26a. Furthermore, unchallenged evidence indicatedthat GMD was so rapidly disbursing its sole remaining asset

ance would have been unable to collect on the money judgment for which it qualified. See id., at 26a, 32a.1

Had it been possible for the District Judge to set up
"a pie-powder court . . . on the instant and on the spot,"
Parks v. Boston, 32 Mass. 198, 208 (1834) (Shaw, C. J.), the
judge could have moved without pause from evidence taking
to entry of final judgment for Alliance, including an order
prohibiting GMD from transferring assets necessary to satisfy the judgment. Lacking any such device for instant adjudication, the judge employed a preliminary injunction "to
preserve the relative positions of the parties until a trial on
the merits [could] be held." University of Texas v. Camenisch, 451 U. S. 390, 395 (1981). The order enjoined GMD
from distributing assets likely to be necessary to satisfy the

judgment in the instant case, but gave Alliance no security
interest in GMD's assets, nor any preference relative to
GMD's other creditors. Moreover, the injunction expressly
reserved to GMD the option of commencing proceedings
under the bankruptcy laws of Mexico or the United States.
App. to Pet. for Cert. 27a. In addition, the District Judge
recorded his readiness to modify the interim order if necessary to keep GMD in business. See id., at 53a. The preliminary injunction thus constrained GMD only to the extent
essential to the subsequent entry of an effective judgment.

The Court nevertheless disapproves the provisional relief
ordered by the District Court, holding that a preliminary
injunction freezing assets is beyond the equitable authority
of the federal courts. I would not so disarm the district

forthrightly concedes that had the District Court declined to issue the
preliminary injunction, GMD would have had no assets available to satisfy
the money judgment that Alliance ultimately obtained. See Tr. of Oral
Arg. 8-9.

courts. As I comprehend the courts' authority, injunctions
of this kind, entered in the circumstances presented here,
are within federal equity jurisdiction. Satisfied that the injunction issued in this case meets the exacting standards for
preliminary equitable relief, I would affirm the judgment of
the Second Circuit.2

II

The Judiciary Act of 1789 gave the lower federal courts
jurisdiction over "all suits . . . in equity." $ 11, 1 Stat. 78.
We have consistently interpreted this jurisdictional grant to
confer on the district courts "authority to administer . . . the
principles of the system of judicial remedies which had been
devised and was being administered" by the English High
Court of Chancery at the time of the founding. Atlas Life
Ins. Co. v. W. I. Southern, Inc., 306 U. S. 563, 568 (1939).

As I see it, the preliminary injunction ordered by the District Court was consistent with these principles. We long
ago recognized that district courts properly exercise their
equitable jurisdiction where "the remedy in equity could
alone furnish relief, and . . . the ends of justice requir[e] the
injunction to be issued." Watson v. Sutherland, 5 Wall. 74,
79 (1867). Particularly, district courts enjoy the "historic
federal judicial discretion to preserve the situation [through
provisional relief] pending the outcome of a case lodged in
court." 11A C. Wright, A. Miller, & M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure $ 2943, p. 79 (2d ed. 1995). The District
Court acted in this case in careful accord with these prescriptions, issuing the preliminary injunction only upon
well-supported findings that Alliance had "[no] adequate
remedy at law," would be "frustrated" in its ability to recover a judgment absent interim injunctive relief, and was

2 I agree, for the reasons Justice Scalia states, see ante, at 313-318,
that the case is not moot; accordingly, I join Part II of the Court's
opinion.

The Court holds the District Court's preliminary freezeorder impermissible principally because injunctions of this

kind were not "traditionally accorded by courts of equity" atthe time the Constitution was adopted.

Ante, at 319; seeante, at 333. In my view, the Court relies on an unjustifiably static conception of equity jurisdiction. From the begin-ning, we have defined the scope of federal equity in relation
to the principles of equity existing at the separation of thiscountry from England, see, e. g., Payne v. Hook, 7 Wall. 425,
430 (1869); Gordon v. Washington, 295 U. S. 30, 36 (1935); wehave never limited federal equity jurisdiction to the specific
practices and remedies of the pre-Revolutionary Chancellor.Since our earliest cases, we have valued the adaptable
character of federal equitable power. See Seymour v. Freer,8 Wall. 202, 218 (1869) ("[A] court of equity ha[s] unquestionable authority to apply its flexible and comprehensive juris-diction in such manner as might be necessary to the right
administration of justice between the parties."); Hecht Co. v.Bowles, 321 U. S. 321, 329 (1944) ("Flexibility rather than
rigidity has distinguished [federal equity jurisdiction].").We have also recognized that equity must evolve over time,
"in order to meet the requirements of every case, and tosatisfy the needs of a progressive social condition in which
new primary rights and duties are constantly arising andnew kinds of wrongs are constantly committed."

UnionPacific R. Co. v. Chicago, R. I. & P. R. Co., 163 U. S. 564,

3 We have on three occasions considered the availability of a preliminary
injunction to freeze assets pending litigation, see Deckert v. Independence
Shares Corp., 311 U. S. 282 (1940); De Beers Consol. Mines, Ltd. v. United
States, 325 U. S. 212 (1945); United States v. First Nat. City Bank, 379
U. S. 378 (1965). As the Court recognizes, see ante, at 324-327, these
cases involved factual and legal circumstances markedly different from
those presented in this case and thus do not rule out or in the provisional
remedy at issue here.

ed. 1941) (the "American system of equity is preserved andmaintained . . . to render the national jurisprudence as a
whole adequate to the social needs . . . . [I]t possesses aninherent capacity of expansion, so as to keep abreast of
each succeeding generation and age."). A dynamic equityjurisprudence is of special importance in the commercial law
context. As we observed more than a century ago: "It mustnot be forgotten that in the increasing complexities of modern business relations equitable remedies have necessarilyand steadily been expanded, and no inflexible rule has been
permitted to circumscribe them." Union Pacific R. Co.,163 U. S., at 600-601. On this understanding of equity's
character, we have upheld diverse injunctions that wouldhave been beyond the contemplation of the 18th-century
Chancellor.4Compared to many contemporary adaptations of equitable
remedies, the preliminary injunction Alliance sought in thiscase was a modest measure. In operation, moreover, the
preliminary injunction to freeze assets pendente lite may bea less heavy-handed remedy than prejudgment attachment,

4 In a series of cases implementing the desegregation mandate of Brown
v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954), for example, we recognized the
need for district courts to draw on their equitable jurisdiction to supervise
various aspects of local school administration. See Freeman v. Pitts, 503
U. S. 467, 491-492 (1992) (describing responsibility shouldered by district
courts, "in a manner consistent with the purposes and objectives of [their]
equitable power," first, to structure and supervise desegregation decrees,
then, as school districts achieved compliance, to relinquish control at a
measured pace). Similarly, courts enforcing the antitrust laws have superintended intricate programs of corporate dissolution or divestiture.

of the office of equity, the facts of this case, and the moderate,
status quo preserving provisional remedy, I am persuadedthat the District Court acted appropriately.

5

I do not question that equity courts traditionally have notissued preliminary injunctions stopping a party sued for an

unsecured debt from disposing of assets pending adjudica-tion. (As the Court recognizes, however, see

ante, at 319-
321, the historical availability of prejudgment freeze injunc-tions in the context of creditors' bills remains cloudy.) But

it is one thing to recognize that equity courts typically didnot provide this relief, quite another to conclude that, therefore, the remedy was beyond equity's capacity. I would not
draw such a conclusion.

Chancery may have refused to issue injunctions of this
sort simply because they were not needed to secure a just
result in an age of slow-moving capital and comparatively
immobile wealth. By turning away cases that the law
courts could deal with adequately, the Chancellor acted to
reduce the tension inevitable when justice was divided between two discrete systems. See Wasserman, supra, at 319.
But as the facts of this case so plainly show, for creditors
situated as Alliance is, the remedy at law is worthless absent
the provisional relief in equity's arsenal. Moreover, increasingly sophisticated foreign-haven judgment proofing strategies, coupled with technology that permits the nearly instan5 The Court suggests that a "debtor's right to a jury trial on [a] legal
claim" counsels against the exercise of equity power here. Ante, at 330.
But the decision to award provisional relief--whether equitable or legal--
always rests with the judge. Moreover, the merits of any legal claim will
be resolved by a jury, if there is any material issue of fact for trial, and
findings made at the preliminary stage do not bind the jury. See Wasserman, 67 Wash. L. Rev., at 322-323.

taneous transfer of assets abroad, suggests that defendantsmay succeed in avoiding meritorious claims in ways unimaginable before the merger of law and equity. See LoPucki,The Death of Liability, 106 Yale L. J. 1, 32-38 (1996).
I am not ready to say a responsible Chancellor today woulddeny Alliance relief on the ground that prior case law is
unsupportive.The development of

Mareva injunctions in England after1975 supports the view of the lower courts in this case, a

view to which I adhere. As the Court observes, see ante,at 327-329, preliminary asset-freeze injunctions have been
available in English courts since the 1975 Court of Appealdecision in

Mareva Compania Naviera S. A. v. Interna-tional Bulkcarriers S. A., 2 Lloyd's Rep. 509. Although the

cases reveal some uncertainty regarding Mareva's jurisdic-tional basis, the better-reasoned and more recent decisions
ground Mareva in equity's traditional power to remedy the"abuse" of legal process by defendants and the "injustice"
that would result from defendants "making themselvesjudgment-proof " by disposing of their assets during the
pendency of litigation. Iraqi Ministry of Defence v. Arcepey Shipping Co., 1 All E. R. 480, 484-487 (1979) (citationsomitted); see Hetherington, Introduction to the Mareva Injunction, in Mareva Injunctions 1, 10-13, and n. 95, 20 (M.Hetherington ed. 1983) (explaining the doctrinal basis of this
jurisdictional theory and citing cases adopting it). Thatgrounding, in my judgment, is secure.

The Court worries that permitting preliminary injunctionsto freeze assets would allow creditors, " `on a mere statement

of belief that the defendant can easily make away with ortransport his money or goods, [to] impose an injunction on
him, indefinite in duration, disabling him to use so much ofhis funds or property as the court deems necessary for secu527US1 Unit: $U78 [05-09-01 12:58:54] PAGES PGT: OPIN

rity or compliance with its possible decree.' " Ante, at 327(quoting

De Beers Consol. Mines, Ltd. v. United States, 325
U. S. 212, 222 (1945)). Given the strong showings a creditorwould be required to make to gain the provisional remedy,

and the safeguards on which the debtor could insist, I agree
with the Second Circuit "that this `parade of horribles'[would] not come to pass." 143 F. 3d 688, 696 (1998).

Under standards governing preliminary injunctive reliefgenerally, a plaintiff must show a likelihood of success on the
merits and irreparable injury in the absence of an injunction.See

Doran v. Salem Inn, Inc., 422 U. S. 922, 931 (1975).
Plaintiffs with questionable claims would not meet the likelihood of success criterion. See 11A Wright, Miller, & Kane,
Federal Practice and Procedure $ 2948.3, at 184-188 (as a
general rule, plaintiff seeking preliminary injunction must
demonstrate a reasonable probability of success). The irreparable injury requirement would not be met by unsubstantiated allegations that a defendant may dissipate assets.
See id., $ 2948.1, at 153 ("Speculative injury is not sufficient."); see also Wasserman, 67 Wash. L. Rev., at 286-305
(discussing application of traditional preliminary injunction
requirements to provisional asset-freeze requests). As the
Court of Appeals recognized, provisional freeze orders would
be appropriate in damages actions only upon a finding that,
without the freeze, "the movant would be unable to collect
[a money] judgment." 143 F. 3d, at 697. The preliminary
asset-freeze order, in short, would rank and operate as an
extraordinary remedy.

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(c), moreover, requires
a preliminary injunction applicant to post a bond "in such
sum as the court deems proper, for the payment of such costs
and damages as may be incurred or suffered by any party
who is found to have been wrongfully enjoined." As an essential condition for a preliminary freeze order, a district
court could demand sufficient security to ensure a remedy
for wrongly enjoined defendants. Furthermore, it would be

Opinion of Ginsburg, J.
incumbent on a district court to "match the scope of its in-junction to the most probable size of the likely judgment,"

thereby sparing the defendant from undue hardship. SeeHoxworth v. Blinder, Robinson & Co., 903 F. 2d 186, 199
(CA3 1990); cf. App. to Pet. for Cert. 53a (District Courtexpressed readiness to modify the preliminary injunction if
necessary to GMD's continuance in business).The protections in place guard against any routine or arbitrary imposition of a preliminary freeze order designed tostop the dissipation of assets that would render a court's
judgment worthless. Cf. ante, at 327, 332-333. The casewe face should be paradigmatic. There was no question that
GMD's debt to Alliance was due and owing. And the shortspan--less than four months--between preliminary injunction and summary judgment shows that the temporary re-straint on GMD did not linger beyond the time necessary for
a fair and final adjudication in a busy but efficiently operatedcourt. Absent immediate judicial action, Alliance would
have been left with a multimillion dollar judgment on which
it could collect not a penny.6 In my view, the District Courtproperly invoked its equitable power to avoid that manifestly

unjust result and to protect its ability to render an enforceable final judgment.At the hearing on the preliminary injunction, the District

Judge asked: "We have got a case where there is no defense

6 Before the District Court, Alliance frankly acknowledged the existence
of other, unrepresented creditors. While acting to protect its own interest, Alliance asked the District Court to fashion relief that "does not just
directly benefit us, but benefits . . . the whole class of creditors" by creating "an even playing field" among creditors. App. to Pet. for Cert. 46a;
see also id., at 45a (Alliance suggests that District Court direct GMD to
set up a trust in compliance with Mexican law in order to oversee distributions to creditors). The Court supplies no reason to think that Alliance
should have abandoned its rock-solid claim just because other creditors,
for whatever reason, failed to bring suit. But cf. ante, at 331 ("respondents did not represent all of the holders of the Notes; they were an active
few who sought to benefit at the expense of the other [creditors]").

presented, why shouldn't I be able to provide [Alliance]with [injunctive] relief?" App. to Pet. for Cert. 34a. Why,

the District Judge asked, should GMD be allowed "to usethe process of the court to delay entry of a judgment as to
which there is no defense? Why is that equitable?" Id., at36a. The Court gives no satisfactory answer.

B
Contrary to the Court's suggestion, see ante, at 332, thiscase involves no judicial usurpation of Congress' authority.

Congress, of course, can instruct the federal courts to issuepreliminary injunctions freezing assets pending final judgment, or instruct them not to, and the courts must heed Con-gress' command. See

Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, 326 U. S.99, 105 (1945) ("Congressional curtailment of equity powers

must be respected."). Indeed, Congress has restricted theequity jurisdiction of federal courts in a variety of contexts.
See Yakus v. United States, 321 U. S. 414, 442, n. 8 (1944)(cataloging statutes regulating federal equity power).

The Legislature, however, has said nothing about prelimi-nary freeze orders. The relevant question, therefore, is
whether, absent congressional direction, the general equita-ble powers of the federal courts permit relief of the kind
fashioned by the District Court. I would find the defaultrule in the grand aims of equity. Where, as here, legal remedies are not "practical and efficient," Payne, 7 Wall., at 431,the federal courts must rely on their "flexible jurisdiction in
equity . . . to protect all rights and do justice to all con-cerned,"

Rubber Co. v. Goodyear, 9 Wall. 788, 807 (1870). Nocountervailing precedent or principle holds the federal courts

powerless to prevent a defendant from dissipating assets, tothe destruction of a plaintiff 's claim, during the course of
judicial proceedings. Accordingly, I would affirm the judg-ment of the Court of Appeals and uphold the District Court's
preliminary injunction.

MARTIN, DIRECTOR, MICHIGAN DEPARTMENT OFCORRECTIONS,

et al. v. HADIX et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe sixth circuit

No. 98-262. Argued March 30, 1999--Decided June 21, 1999
Respondent prisoners filed two federal class actions in 1977 and 1980

against petitioner prison officials challenging the conditions of confinement in the Michigan prison system under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983. By 1987,
the plaintiffs had prevailed in both suits, the District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan had ruled them entitled to attorney's fees under

$ 1988 for postjudgment monitoring of the defendants' compliance with
remedial decrees, systems were established for awarding those fees on
a semiannual basis, and the District Court had established specific
market rates for awarding fees. By April 26, 1996, the effective date
of the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PLRA), the prevailing
market rate in both cases was $150 per hour. However, $ 803(d)(3) of
the PLRA, 42 U. S. C. $ 1997e(d)(3), limits the size of fees that may be
awarded to attorneys who litigate prisoner lawsuits. In the Eastern
District, those fees are capped at a maximum hourly rate of $112.50.
When first presented with the issue, the District Court concluded that
the PLRA cap did not limit attorney's fees for services performed in
these cases prior to, but that were still unpaid by, the PLRA's effective
date, and the Sixth Circuit affirmed. Fee requests next were filed in
both cases for services performed between January 1, 1996, and June
30, 1996, a period encompassing work performed both before and after
the PLRA's effective date. In nearly identical orders, the District
Court reiterated its earlier conclusion that the PLRA does not limit fees
for work performed before April 26, 1996, but concluded that the PLRA
cap does limit fees for services performed after that date. The Sixth
Circuit consolidated the appeals from these orders, and, as relevant
here, affirmed in part and reversed in part. It held that the PLRA's
fee limitation does not apply to cases pending on the enactment date.
If it did, the court held, it would have an impermissible retroactive
effect, regardless of when the work was performed.

Held: Section 803(d)(3) limits attorney's fees for postjudgment monitoring

services performed after the PLRA's effective date, but does not limit
fees for monitoring performed before that date. Pp. 352-362.

(a) Whether the PLRA applies to cases pending when it was enacted
depends on whether Congress has expressly prescribed the statute's

527US1 Unit: $U79 [05-02-01 17:53:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Syllabus
temporal reach. Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U. S. 244, 280.
If not, the Court determines whether the statute's application to the
conduct at issue would result in a retroactive effect. If so, the Court
presumes that the statute does not apply to that conduct. E. g., ibid.
P. 352.

(b) Congress has not expressly mandated $ 803(d)(3)'s temporal reach.
The fundamental problem with petitioners' arguments that the language of $ 803(d)(1)--which provides for attorney's fees "[i]n any action brought by a prisoner who is confined" (emphasis added)--and of

$ 803(d)(3)--which relates to fee "award[s]"--clearly expresses a congressional intent that $ 803(d) apply to pending cases is that $ 803(d) is
better read as setting substantive limits on the award of attorney's
fees, and as making no attempt to define the temporal reach of these
substantive limitations. Had Congress intended $ 803(d)(3) to apply to
all fee orders entered after the effective date, it could have used language that unambiguously addresses the section's temporal reach, such
as the language suggested in Landgraf: "[T]he [PLRA] shall apply to
all proceedings pending on or commenced after the date of enactment."
511 U. S., at 260 (internal quotation marks omitted). Pp. 353-355.

(c) The Court also rejects respondents' contention that the PLRA's
fee provisions reveal a congressional intent that they apply prospectively only to cases filed after the effective date. According to respondents, a comparison of $ 802--which, in addressing "appropriate
remedies" in prison litigation, explicitly provides that it applies to
pending cases, $ 802(b)(1)--with $ 803--which is silent on the subject--
supports the negative inference that $ 803 does not apply to pending
cases. This argument is based on an analogy to Lindh v. Murphy,
521 U. S. 320, 329, in which the Court, in concluding that chapter 153
of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 was inapplicable to pending cases, relied heavily on the observation that
chapter 154 of that Act included explicit language making it applicable
to such cases. The "negative inference" argument is inapposite here.
In Lindh, the negative inference arose from the fact that the two chapters addressed similar issues, see ibid.; here, $$ 802 and 803 address
wholly distinct subject matters. Finally, respondents' attempt to bolster their "negative inference" argument with the legislative history--
which indicates that $ 803's attorney's fees limitations were originally
part of $ 802, along with language making them applicable to pending
cases--overstates the inferences that can be drawn from an ambiguous
act of legislative drafting. Pp. 355-357.

(d) Application of $ 803(d)(3) in parts of this case would have retroactive effects inconsistent with the usual rule that legislation is deemed
to be prospective. Pp. 357-362.

(1) This inquiry demands a commonsense, functional judgment about
whether the new provision attaches new legal consequences to events
completed before its enactment. Landgraf, 511 U. S., at 270. This judgment should be informed and guided by familiar considerations of fair notice, reasonable reliance, and settled expectations. Ibid. Pp. 357-358.

(2) For postjudgment monitoring performed before the PLRA's
effective date, the attorney's fees provisions have a retroactive effect
contrary to the usual assumption that statutes are prospective in operation. The attorneys in both cases below had a reasonable expectation that work they performed before the PLRA's enactment would be
compensated at the pre-PLRA rates set by the District Court. The
PLRA, as applied to work performed before its effective date, would
alter the fee arrangement post hoc by reducing the compensation rate.
To give effect to the PLRA's fees limitations, after the fact, would
attach new legal consequences to completed conduct. Landgraf, supra,
at 270. The Court rejects petitioners' contention that the application
of a new attorney's fees provision is proper in that fees questions do
not change the parties' substantive obligations because they are collateral to the main cause of action. When determining whether a new
statute operates retroactively, it is not enough to attach a label
(e. g., "procedural," "collateral") to the statute; it must be asked whether
the statute operates retroactively, as does the PLRA. Petitioners also
misplace their reliance on Bradley v. School Bd. of Richmond, 416 U. S.
696, 720-721. Unlike the situation here, the award of statutory attorney's fees in that case did not upset any reasonable expectations of the
parties. See Landgraf, 511 U. S., at 276-279. Thus, in the absence of
an express command by Congress to apply the PLRA retroactively, the
Court declines to do so. Id., at 280. Pp. 358-360.

(3) With respect to postjudgment monitoring performed after the
PLRA's effective date, by contrast, there is no retroactive effect, and
the PLRA fees cap applies to such work. On April 26, 1996, through
the PLRA, the plaintiffs' attorneys were on notice that their hourly
rate had been adjusted. From that point forward, they would be paid
at a rate consistent with the law's dictates, and any expectation of compensation at the pre-PLRA rates was unreasonable. The Court rejects
respondents' contention that the PLRA has retroactive effect in this
context because it attaches new legal consequences (a lower pay rate)
to conduct completed before enactment, the attorney's initial decision to
file suit on behalf of prisoners. That argument is based on the erroneous assumption that the attorney's initial decision to file a case is irrevocable. Respondents do not seriously contend that the attorneys here
were prohibited from withdrawing from the case during the postjudgment monitoring stage. Pp. 360-361.

Opinion of the Court
Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court.*
Section 803(d)(3) of the Prison Litigation Reform Act of1995 (PLRA or Act), 110 Stat. 1321-72, 42 U. S. C. $ 1997e(d)(3)

(1994 ed., Supp. III),# places limits on the fees that may beawarded to attorneys who litigate prisoner lawsuits. We are
asked to decide how this section applies to cases that werepending when the PLRA became effective on April 26, 1996.
We conclude that $ 803(d)(3) limits attorney's fees with re-spect to postjudgment monitoring services performed after
the PLRA's effective date but it does not so limit fees forpostjudgment monitoring performed before the effective
date. I

The fee disputes before us arose out of two class actionlawsuits challenging the conditions of confinement in the
Michigan prison system. The first case, which we will call
Glover, began in 1977 when a now-certified class of femaleprisoners filed suit under Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983,

in the United States District Court for the Eastern Districtof Michigan. The Glover plaintiffs alleged that the defendant prison officials had violated their rights under the EqualProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by denying
them access to vocational and educational opportunities thatwere available to male prisoners. They also claimed that
the defendants had denied them their right of access to thecourts. After a bench trial, the District Court found "[s]ignificant discrimination against the female prison population"in violation of the Equal Protection Clause,

$ 803(d)(d) of the PLRA, like the parties, we refer to it simply as $ 803(d)

son, 478 F. Supp. 1075, 1083 (1979), and concluded that thedefendants' policies had denied the

Glover plaintiffs their
right of meaningful access to the courts, id., at 1096-1097.In 1981, the District Court entered a "Final Order" detailing

the specific actions to be undertaken by the defendants to
remedy the constitutional violations. Glover v. Johnson,510 F. Supp. 1019 (ED Mich.). One year later, the court

found that the plaintiffs were "prevailing parties" and thusentitled to attorney's fees under 42 U. S. C. $ 1988 (1994 ed.
and Supp. III). Glover v. Johnson, Civ. Action No. 77-71229(ED Mich., Feb. 2, 1982), App. 103a.

In 1985, the parties agreed to, and the District Court entered, an order providing that the plaintiffs were entitled to
attorney's fees for postjudgment monitoring of the defendants' compliance with the court's remedial decrees. Glover
v. Johnson, No. 77-71229 (ED Mich., Nov. 12, 1985), App. 125a
(Order Granting Plaintiffs' Motion for System for Submission
of Attorney Fee). This order also established the system
for awarding monitoring fees that was in place when the
present dispute arose. Under this system, the plaintiffs
submit their fee requests on a semiannual basis, and the
defendants then have 28 days to submit any objections to
the requested award. The District Court resolves any disputes. Ibid. In an appeal from a subsequent dispute over
the meaning of this order, the Court of Appeals for the Sixth
Circuit affirmed that the plaintiffs were entitled to attorney's
fees, at the prevailing market rate, for postjudgment monitoring. Glover v. Johnson, 934 F. 2d 703, 715-716 (1991).
The prevailing market rate has been adjusted over the years,
but it is currently set at $150 per hour. See Hadix v. Johnson, 143 F. 3d 246, 248 (CA6 1998) (describing facts of
Glover).

The second case at issue here, Hadix, began in 1980. At
that time, male prisoners at the State Prison of Southern
Michigan, Central Complex (SPSM-CC), filed suit under
42 U. S. C. $ 1983 in the United States District Court for

Opinion of the Court
the Eastern District of Michigan claiming that the condi-tions of their confinement at SPSM-CC violated the First,

Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution.Five years later, the

Hadix plaintiffs and the defendant
prison officials entered into a consent decree to " `assure
the constitutionality' " of the conditions of confinement atSPSM-CC.

Hadix v. Johnson, 144 F. 3d 925, 930 (CA6 1998)
(quoting consent decree). The consent decree, which wasapproved by the District Court, addressed a variety of issues

at SPSM-CC, ranging from sanitation and safety to foodservice, mail, and access to the courts.

In November 1987, the District Court entered an order
awarding attorney's fees to the Hadix plaintiffs for postjudgment monitoring of the defendants' compliance with the
consent decree. Hadix v. Johnson, No. 80-CV-73581 (ED
Mich., Nov. 19, 1987), App. 79a. Subsequently, the Hadix
plaintiffs were awarded attorney's fees through a procedure similar to the procedure that had been established for
the Glover plaintiffs: The plaintiffs submitted semiannual fee
requests, the defendants filed timely objections to these requests, and the District Court resolved any disputes. The
District Court set, and periodically adjusted, a specific market rate for the fee awards; by 1995, that rate was set at
$150 per hour for lead counsel. See Hadix v. Johnson, 65
F. 3d 532, 536 (CA6 1995).

Thus, by 1987, Glover and Hadix were on parallel paths.
In both cases, the District Court had concluded that the
plaintiffs were entitled to postjudgment monitoring fees
under 42 U. S. C. $ 1988, and the parties had established a
system for awarding those fees on a semiannual basis.
Moreover, in both cases, the District Court had established
specific market rates for awarding fees. By the time the
PLRA was enacted, the prevailing market rate in both cases
had been set at $150 per hour.

The fee landscape changed with the passage of the PLRA
on April 26, 1996. The PLRA, as its name suggests, con527US1 Unit: $U79 [05-02-01 17:53:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
tains numerous provisions governing the course of prisonlitigation in the federal courts. It provides, for example,

limits on the availability of certain types of relief in suchsuits, see 18 U. S. C. $ 3626(a)(2) (1994 ed., Supp. III), and for
the termination of prospective relief orders after a limited
time, $ 3626(b). The section of the PLRA at issue here,$ 803(d)(3), places a cap on the size of attorney's fees that

may be awarded in prison litigation suits:

"(d) Attorney's fees"(1) In any action brought by a prisoner who is confined to any jail, prison, or other correctional facility, in
which attorney's fees are authorized under [42 U. S. C.$ 1988], such fees shall not be awarded, except to the

extent [authorized here].. . . . .

"(3) No award of attorney's fees in an action describedin paragraph (1) shall be based on an hourly rate greater
than 150 percent of the hourly rate established under
[18 U. S. C. $ 3006A (1994 ed. and Supp. III)], for pay-ment of court-appointed counsel." $ 803(d), 42 U. S. C.

$ 1997e(d) (1994 ed., Supp. III).
Court-appointed attorneys in the Eastern District of Michi-gan are compensated at a maximum rate of $75 per hour,

and thus, under $ 803(d)(3), the PLRA fee cap for attorneys
working on prison litigation suits translates into a maximumhourly rate of $112.50.

Questions involving the PLRA first arose in both Gloverand

Hadix with respect to fee requests for postjudgment
monitoring performed before the PLRA was enacted. In
both cases, in early 1996, the plaintiffs submitted fee requests for work performed during the last half of 1995.
These requests were still pending when the PLRA became
effective on April 26, 1996. In both cases, the District Court
concluded that the PLRA fee cap did not limit attorney's fees
for services performed in these cases prior to the effective

Glover and Hadix for

these fee requests were subject to the fee cap found in

$ 803(d)(3) of the PLRA, and the District Court accepted
this argument in part. In nearly identical orders issued in
the two cases, the court reiterated its earlier conclusion that
the PLRA does not limit fees for work performed before
April 26, 1996, but concluded that the PLRA fee cap does
limit fees for services performed after the effective date.

The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit consolidated
the appeals from these orders, and, as relevant here, affirmed
in part and reversed in part. Hadix v. Johnson, 143 F. 3d
246 (1998). According to the Court of Appeals, the PLRA's
fee limitation does not apply to fee requests such as those
in Hadix and Glover that relate to cases that were pending
on the date of enactment. If it were applied to pending
cases, the court held, it would have an impermissible retroactive effect, regardless of when the work was performed.

The Court of Appeals' holding--that the PLRA's attorney's fees provisions do not apply to pending cases--is inconsistent with the holdings of other Circuits on these issues.

those fees compensate attorneys for work performed priorto the enactment of the PLRA. Alexander S. v. Boyd, 113

In this Court, the Hadix and Glover plaintiffs are respond-ents, and the defendant prison officials from both cases are
petitioners. II

Petitioners contend that the PLRA applies to Glover and
Hadix, cases that were pending when the PLRA wasenacted. This fact pattern presents a recurring question in

the law: When should a new federal statute be applied topending cases? See,

e. g., Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U. S. 320(1997); Hughes Aircraft Co. v. United States ex rel. Schumer,

520 U. S. 939 (1997). To answer this question, we ask first"whether Congress has expressly prescribed the statute's
proper reach." Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U. S.244, 280 (1994). If there is no congressional directive on the
temporal reach of a statute, we determine whether the appli-cation of the statute to the conduct at issue would result in
a retroactive effect. Ibid. If so, then in keeping with our"traditional presumption" against retroactivity, we presume
that the statute does not apply to that conduct. Ibid. Seealso

Opinion of the Court

A

1

Congress has not expressly mandated the temporal reach
of $ 803(d)(3). Section 803(d)(1) provides that "[i]n any action brought by a prisoner who is confined [to a correctional
facility] . . . attorney's fees . . . shall not be awarded, except"
as authorized by the statute. Section 803(d)(3) further provides that "[n]o award of attorney's fees . . . shall be based
on an hourly rate greater than 150 percent of the hourly
rate established under [18 U. S. C. $ 3006A], for payment of
court-appointed counsel." Petitioners contend that this language--particularly the phrase "[i]n any action brought by
a prisoner who is confined," $ 803(d)(1) (emphasis added)--
clearly expresses a congressional intent that $ 803(d) apply
to pending cases. They argue that "any" is a broad, encompassing word, and that its use with "brought," a pasttense verb, demonstrates congressional intent to apply the
fees limitations to all fee awards entered after the PLRA
became effective, even when those awards were for services performed before the PLRA was enacted. They also
contend that $ 803(d)(3), by its own terms, applies to all
"award[s]"--understood as the actual court order directing
the payment of fees--entered after the effective date of the
PLRA, regardless of when the work was performed.

The fundamental problem with all of petitioners' statutory arguments is that they stretch the language of $ 803(d)
to find congressional intent on the temporal scope of that
section when we believe that $ 803(d) is better read as setting
substantive limits on the award of attorney's fees. Section
803(d)(1), for example, prohibits fee awards unless those fees
were "directly and reasonably incurred" in the suit, and unless those fees are "proportionately related" to, or "directly
and reasonably incurred in enforcing," the relief ordered.
42 U. S. C. $ 1997e(d)(1) (1994 ed., Supp. III). Similarly,

$ 803(d)(3) sets substantive limits by prohibiting the award

527US1 Unit: $U79 [05-02-01 17:53:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN
354 MARTIN v. HADIX

Opinion of the Court
of fees based on hourly rates greater than a specified rate.In other words, these sections define the substantive availability of attorney's fees; they do not purport to define thetemporal reach of these substantive limitations. This language falls short of demonstrating a "clear congressional intent" favoring retroactive application of these fees limita-tions.

Landgraf, 511 U. S., at 280. It falls short, in other
words, of the "unambiguous directive" or "express com-mand" that the statute is to be applied retroactively.

Id., at
263, 280.In any event, we note that "brought," as used in this

section, is not a past-tense verb; rather, it is the participle
in a participial phrase modifying the noun "action." And
although the word "any" is broad, it stretches the imagination to suggest that Congress intended, through the use
of this one word, to make the fee limitations applicable to all
fee awards. Finally, we do not believe that the phrase "[n]o
award" in $ 803(d)(3) demonstrates congressional intent to
apply that section to all fee awards (i. e., fee payment orders)
entered after the PLRA's effective date. Had Congress intended $ 803(d)(3) to apply to all fee orders entered after the
effective date, even when those awards compensate for work
performed before the effective date, it could have used language more obviously targeted to addressing the temporal
reach of that section. It could have stated, for example, that
"No award entered after the effective date of this Act shall
be based on an hourly rate greater than the ceiling rate."

The conclusion that $ 803(d) does not clearly express congressional intent that it apply retroactively is strengthened
by comparing $ 803(d) to the language that we suggested in
Landgraf might qualify as a clear statement that a statute was to apply retroactively: "[T]he new provisions shall
apply to all proceedings pending on or commenced after the
date of enactment." Id., at 260 (internal quotation marks
omitted). This provision, unlike the language of the PLRA,
unambiguously addresses the temporal reach of the statute.

Opinion of the Court
With no such analogous language making explicit referenceto the statute's temporal reach, it cannot be said that Congress has "expressly prescribed" $ 803(d)'s temporal reach.Id., at 280.

2
Respondents agree that $ 803(d) of the PLRA lacks anexpress directive that the statute apply retroactively, but

they contend that the PLRA reveals congressional intentthat the fees provisions apply

prospectively only. That is,respondents insist that the PLRA's fees provisions demonstrate that they only apply to cases filed after the effectivedate of the Act. For respondents, this congressional intent
is evident from a study of the Act's structure and legisla-tive history.

According to respondents, a comparison of $$ 802 and 803of the PLRA leads to the conclusion that $ 803(d) should
only apply to cases filed after its enactment. The attorney'sfees provisions are found in $ 803 of the PLRA, and, as described above, this section contains no explicit directivethat it should apply to pending cases. By contrast, $ 802--
addressing "appropriate remedies" in prison litigation--explicitly provides that it applies to pending cases: "[This
section] shall apply with respect to all prospective reliefwhether such relief was originally granted or approved
before, on, or after the date of the enactment of this title."$ 802(b)(1), note following 18 U. S. C. $ 3626 (1994 ed., Supp.
III). According to respondents, the presence of this ex-press command in $ 802, when coupled with $ 803's silence,
supports the negative inference that $ 803 is not to apply topending cases. Respondents buttress this "negative inference" argument by reference to the legislative historyof the fees provisions. Respondents contend that when the
attorney's fees limitations were originally drafted, they werein the section that became $ 802 of the PLRA, which at the
time contained language making them applicable to pendingcases. Later, the fees provisions were moved to what be527US1 Unit: $U79 [05-02-01 17:53:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN
356 MARTIN v. HADIX

Opinion of the Court
came $ 803 of the PLRA, a section without language makingit applicable to pending cases. Thus, according to respondents, when Congress moved the fees provisions out of $ 802,with its explicitly retroactive language, it demonstrated its
intent to apply the fees provisions prospectively only. Brief
for Respondents 15-18.Respondents' "negative inference" argument is based on

an analogy to our decision in Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U. S.320 (1997). In

Lindh, we considered whether chapter 153
of the newly enacted Antiterrorism and Effective DeathPenalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214, was applicable

to pending cases. In concluding that chapter 153 does not
apply to such cases, we relied heavily on the observation
that chapter 154 of AEDPA includes explicit language making that chapter applicable to pending cases. We concluded
that "[n]othing . . . but a different intent explains the different treatment." 521 U. S., at 329. This argument carried special weight because both chapters addressed similar
issues: Chapter 153 established new standards for review of
habeas corpus applications by state prisoners, and chapter
154 created new standards for review of habeas corpus applications by state prisoners under capital sentences. Because
both chapters "govern[ed] standards affecting entitlement to
relief " in habeas cases, "[i]f . . . Congress was reasonably
concerned to ensure that chapter 154 be applied to pending
cases, it should have been just as concerned about chapter
153." Ibid.

Because $$ 802 and 803 address wholly distinct subject
matters, the same negative inference does not arise from
the silence of $ 803. Section 802 addresses "[a]ppropriate
remedies" in prison litigation, prohibiting, for example,
prospective relief unless it is "narrowly drawn" and is "the
least intrusive means necessary to correct the violation."

$ 802(a), 18 U. S. C. $ 3626(a)(1)(A) (1994 ed., Supp. III).
That section also creates new standards designed to encourage the prompt termination of prospective relief or527US1 Unit: $U79 [05-02-01 17:53:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN

357Cite as: 527 U. S. 343 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
ders, providing, for example, for the "immediate termina-tion of any prospective relief if the relief was approved or

granted in the absence of a finding by the court that therelief is narrowly drawn, extends no further than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right, and is theleast intrusive means necessary to correct the violation of
the Federal right." $ 802(a), 18 U. S. C. $ 3626(b)(2). Sec-tion 803(d), by contrast, does not address the propriety of
various forms of relief and does not provide for the immedi-ate termination of ongoing relief orders. Rather, it governs
the award of attorney's fees. Thus, there is no reason toconclude that if Congress was concerned that $ 802 apply to
pending cases, it would "have been just as concerned" that$ 803 apply to pending cases.

Finally, we note that respondents' reliance on the legis-lative history overstates the inferences that can be drawn
from an ambiguous act of legislative drafting. Even if re-spondents are correct about the legislative history, the inference that respondents draw from this history is specu-lative. It rests on the assumption that the

reason the feesprovisions were moved was to move them away from the

language applying $ 802 to pending cases, when they mayhave been moved for a variety of other reasons. This weak
inference provides a thin reed on which to rest the argu-ment that the fees provisions, by negative implication, were
intended to apply prospectively.

B
Because we conclude that Congress has not "expresslyprescribed" the proper reach of $ 803(d)(3),

Landgraf, 511U. S., at 280, we must determine whether application of this

section in this case would have retroactive effects incon-sistent with the usual rule that legislation is deemed to be
prospective. The inquiry into whether a statute operatesretroactively demands a commonsense, functional judgment about "whether the new provision attaches new legal

Opinion of the Court
consequences to events completed before its enactment."Id., at 270. This judgment should be informed and guided

by "familiar considerations of fair notice, reasonable reliance,and settled expectations." Ibid.

1
For postjudgment monitoring performed before the ef-fective date of the PLRA, the PLRA's attorney's fees

provisions, as construed by respondents, would have a retro-active effect contrary to the usual assumption that congressional statutes are prospective in operation. The attorneysin both

Hadix and Glover had a reasonable expectation thatwork they performed prior to enactment of the PLRA in

monitoring petitioners' compliance with the court orderswould be compensated at the pre-PLRA rates as provided
in the stipulated order. Long before the PLRA wasenacted, the plaintiffs were declared prevailing parties, and
the parties agreed to a system for periodically award-ing attorney's fees for postjudgment monitoring. The District Court entered orders establishing that the fees were tobe awarded at prevailing market rates, and specifically set
those rates, as relevant here, at $150 per hour. Respond-ents' counsel performed a specific task--monitoring petitioners' compliance with the court orders--and they were toldthat they would be compensated at a rate of $150 per hour.
Thus, when the lawyers provided these postjudgment moni-toring services before the enactment of the PLRA, they
worked in reasonable reliance on this fee schedule. ThePLRA, as applied to work performed before its effective
date, would alter the fee arrangement post hoc by reducingthe rate of compensation. To give effect to the PLRA's
fees limitations, after the fact, would "attac[h] new legal con-sequences" to completed conduct.

Landgraf, supra, at 270.Petitioners contest this conclusion. They contend that

the application of a new attorney's fees provision is " `un-questionably proper,' " Brief for Petitioners 24 (quoting

527US1 Unit: $U79 [05-02-01 17:53:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
Landgraf, supra, at 273), because fees questions "are in-cidental to, and independent from, the underlying substantive cause of action." They do not, in other words, changethe substantive obligations of the parties because they are
"collateral to the main cause of action." Brief for Petitioners 24-25 (quoting Landgraf, 511 U. S., at 277) (internalquotation marks omitted). Attaching the label "collateral"

to attorney's fees questions does not advance the retroactiv-ity inquiry, however. While it may be possible to generalize
about types of rules that ordinarily will not raise retroactiv-ity concerns, see,

e. g., id., at 273-275, these generalizations
do not end the inquiry. For example, in Landgraf, we acknowledged that procedural rules may often be applied to
pending suits with no retroactivity problems, id., at 275, but
we also cautioned that "the mere fact that a new rule is
procedural does not mean that it applies to every pending
case," id., at 275, n. 29. We took pains to dispel the "sugges[tion] that concerns about retroactivity have no application to procedural rules." Ibid. See also Lindh v. Murphy,
521 U. S., at 327-328. When determining whether a new
statute operates retroactively, it is not enough to attach a
label (e. g., "procedural," "collateral") to the statute; we must
ask whether the statute operates retroactively.

Moreover, petitioners' reliance on our decision in Bradley
v. School Bd. of Richmond, 416 U. S. 696 (1974), to support
their argument that attorney's fees provisions can be applied
retroactively is misplaced. In Bradley, the District Court
had awarded attorney's fees, based on general equitable
principles, to a group of parents who had prevailed in their
suit seeking the desegregation of the Richmond schools.
While the case was pending on appeal, Congress passed a
statute specifically authorizing the award of attorney's fees
for prevailing parties in school desegregation cases. The
Court of Appeals held that the new statute could not authorize fee awards for work performed before the effective date of the new law, but we reversed, holding that the

527US1 Unit: $U79 [05-02-01 17:53:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN
360 MARTIN v. HADIX

Opinion of the Court
fee award in that case was proper. Because attorney's feeswere available, albeit under different principles, before

passage of the statute, and because the District Court hadin fact already awarded fees invoking these different principles, there was no manifest injustice in allowing the feestatute to apply in that case.

Id., at 720-721. We heldthat the award of statutory attorney's fees did not upset any

reasonable expectations of the parties. See also Landgraf,supra, at 276-279 (distinguishing Bradley on these same
grounds). In this case, by contrast, from the beginning ofthese suits, the parties have proceeded on the assumption
that 42 U. S. C. $ 1988 would govern. The PLRA was notpassed until well after respondents had been declared prevailing parties and thus entitled to attorney's fees. To im-pose the new standards now, for work performed before the
PLRA became effective, would upset the reasonable expec-tations of the parties.

2
With respect to postjudgment monitoring performed afterthe effective date of the PLRA, by contrast, there is no retroactivity problem. On April 26, 1996, through the PLRA,the plaintiffs' attorneys were on notice that their hourly rate
had been adjusted. From that point forward, they would bepaid at a rate consistent with the dictates of the law. After
April 26, 1996, any expectation of compensation at the pre-PLRA rates was unreasonable. There is no manifest injustice in telling an attorney performing postjudgment monitor-ing services that, going forward, she will earn a lower hourly
rate than she had earned in the past. If the attorney doesnot wish to perform services at this new, lower pay rate, she
can choose not to work. In other words, as applied to workperformed after the effective date of the PLRA, the PLRA
has future effect on future work; this does not raise retro-activity concerns.

Respondents contend that the PLRA has retroactive effectin this context because it attaches new legal consequences

527US1 Unit: $U79 [05-02-01 17:53:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
(a lower pay rate) to conduct completed before enactment.The preenactment conduct that respondents contend is affected is the attorney's initial decision to file suit on behalfof the prisoner clients. Brief for Respondents 29-31. Even
assuming, arguendo, that when the attorneys filed thesecases in 1977 and 1980, they had a reasonable expectation
that they would be compensated for postjudgment monitor-ing based on a particular fee schedule (

i. e., the pre-PLRA,"prevailing market rate" schedule), respondents' argument

that the PLRA affects pre-PLRA conduct fails because itis based on the assumption that the attorney's initial decision to file a case on behalf of a client is an irrevocable one.In other words, respondents' argument assumes that once
an attorney files suit, she must continue working on thatcase until the decree is terminated. Respondents provide
no support for this assumption, however. They allude toethical constraints on an attorney's ability to withdraw from
a case midstream, see Brief for Respondents 29 ("And finally,it is at that time that plaintiffs' counsel commit themselves
ethically to continued representation of their clients to en-sure that the Constitution is honored, a course of conduct
that cannot lightly be altered"), but they do not seriouslycontend that the attorneys here were prohibited from withdrawing from the case during the postjudgment monitor-ing stage, see, e. g., Tr. of Oral Arg. 42-43. It cannot be
said that the PLRA changes the legal consequences of theattorneys' pre-PLRA decision to file the case.

C
In sum, we conclude that the PLRA contains no expresscommand about its temporal scope. Because we find that

the PLRA, if applied to postjudgment monitoring servicesperformed before the effective date of the Act, would have
a retroactive effect inconsistent with our assumption thatstatutes are prospective, in the absence of an express command by Congress to apply the Act retroactively, we de527US1 Unit: $U79 [05-02-01 17:53:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN

cline to do so. Landgraf, 511 U. S., at 280. With respectto postjudgment monitoring performed after the effective

date, by contrast, there is no retroactive effect, and thePLRA fees cap applies to such work. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is affirmedin part and reversed in part.

It is so ordered.

Justice Scalia, concurring in part and concurring in thejudgment.
Our task in this case is to determine the temporal application of that provision of the Prison Litigation Reform Actof 1995 (PLRA), 42 U. S. C. $ 1997e(d)(3) (1994 ed., Supp. III),

which prescribes that "[n]o award of attorney's fees in anaction [brought by a prisoner in which attorney's fees are
authorized under 42 U. S. C. $ 1988 (1994 ed., and Supp. III)]
shall be based on an hourly rate greater than 150 percent ofthe hourly rate established under [18 U. S. C. $ 3006A (1994

ed., and Supp. III)] for payment of court-appointed counsel."I agree with the Court that the intended temporal application is not set forth in the text of the statute, and thatthe outcome must therefore be governed by our interpretive
principle that, in absence of contrary indication, a statutewill not be construed to have retroactive application, see
Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U. S. 244, 280 (1994).
But that leaves open the key question: retroactive in refer-ence to what? The various options in the present case include (1) the alleged violation upon which the fee-imposingsuit is based (applying the new fee rule to any case involving
an alleged violation that occurred before the PLRA becameeffective would be giving it "retroactive application"); (2) the
lawyer's undertaking to prosecute the suit for which attor-ney's fees were provided (applying the new fee rule to any
case in which the lawyer was retained before the PLRA became effective would be giving it "retroactive application");

527US1 Unit: $U79 [05-02-01 17:53:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN

363Cite as: 527 U. S. 343 (1999)
Opinion of Scalia, J.
(3) the filing of the suit in which the fees are imposed (applying the new fee rule to any suit brought before the PLRA
became effective would be giving it "retroactive application"); (4) the doing of the legal work for which the fees are
payable (applying the new fee rule to any work done before
the PLRA became effective would be giving it "retroactive
application"); and (5) the actual award of fees in a prisoner
case (applying the new fee rule to an award rendered before
the PLRA became effective would be giving it "retroactive
application").

My disagreement with the Court's approach is that, in deciding which of the above five reference points for the retroactivity determination ought to be selected, it seems to me
not much help to ask which of them would frustrate expectations. In varying degrees, they all would. As I explained
in my concurrence in Landgraf, supra, at 286 (opinion concurring in judgments), I think the decision of which reference point (which "retroactivity event") to select should
turn upon which activity the statute was intended to regulate. If it was intended to affect primary conduct, No. 1
should govern; if it was intended to induce lawyers to undertake representation, No. 2--and so forth.

In my view, the most precisely defined purpose of the provision at issue here was to reduce the previously established
incentive for lawyers to work on prisoners' civil rights cases.
If the PLRA is viewed in isolation, of course, its purpose
could be regarded as being simply to prevent a judicial
award of fees in excess of the referenced amount--in which
case the relevant retroactivity event would be the award.
In reality, however, the PLRA simply revises the fees provided for by $ 1988, and it seems to me that the underlying
purpose of that provision must govern its amendment as
well--which purpose was to provide an appropriate incentive
for lawyers to work on (among other civil rights cases) pris527US1 Unit: $U79 [05-02-01 17:53:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN

oner suits.1 That being so, the relevant retroactivity eventis the doing of the work for which the incentive was offered.

All work rendered in reliance upon the fee assurance con-tained in the former $ 1988 will be reimbursed at those rates;

all work rendered after the revised fee assurance of thePLRA became effective will be limited to the new rates.
The District Court's announcement that it would permit fu-ture work to be billed at a higher rate operated

in futuro;it sought to regulate future conduct rather than adjudicate past. It was therefore no less subject to revision bystatute than is an injunction. Pennsylvania v. Wheeling &
Belmont Bridge Co., 18 How. 421, 436 (1856).For these reasons, I concur in the judgment of the Court
and join all but Part II-B of its opinion.

Justice Ginsburg, with whom Justice Stevens joins,concurring in part and dissenting in part.

I agree with the Court's determination that $ 803(d) of thePrison Litigation Reform Act of 1995, (PLRA or Act), 42
U. S. C. $ 1997e(d) (1994 ed., Supp. III), does not "limit feesfor postjudgment monitoring performed before the [Act's] effective date," ante, at 347, and with much of the reasoningset out in Parts I, II-A-1, and II-B-1 of the Court's opinion.
I disagree, however, with the holding that $ 803(d) "limitsattorney's fees with respect to postjudgment monitoring
services performed after . . . the effective date." Ibid.

1 Although the fees awarded under $ 1988 are payable to the party rather
than to the lawyer, I think it clear that the purpose of the provision was
to enable the civil rights plaintiffs to offer a rate of compensation that
would attract attorneys.

2 I reject Justice Ginsburg's contention that the retroactivity event

should be the attorney's undertaking to represent the civil rights plaintiff.
The fees are intended to induce not merely signing on (no time can be
billed for that) but actually doing the legal work. Like the Court, I do
not think it true that an attorney who has signed on cannot terminate his
representation; he assuredly can if the client says that he will no longer

Opinion of Ginsburg, J.
I do not find in the PLRA's text or history a satisfactorybasis for concluding that Congress meant to order a midstream change, placing cases commenced before the PLRAbecame law under the new regime. I would therefore affirm
in full the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the SixthCircuit, which held $ 803(d) inapplicable to cases brought to
court prior to the enactment of the PLRA. To explain myview of the case, I retread some of the factual and analytical
ground treated in more detail in the Court's opinion.

I
On April 26, 1996, President Clinton signed the PLRA intolaw. Section 803(d) of the Act, governing attorney's fees,

provides:

"(1) In any action brought by a prisoner who is con-fined to any jail, prison, or other correctional facility, in

which attorney's fees are authorized under section 1988of this title, such fees shall not be awarded, except to
the extent that--"(A) the fee was directly and reasonably incurred in
proving an actual violation of the plaintiff 's rights pro-tected by a statute pursuant to which a fee may be
awarded under section 1988 of this title; and"(B)(i) the amount of the fee is proportionately related to the court ordered relief for the violation; or"(ii) the fee was directly and reasonably incurred in
enforcing the relief ordered for the violation."(2) Whenever a monetary judgment is awarded in an
action described in paragraph (1), a portion of the judg-ment (not to exceed 25 percent) shall be applied to
satisfy the amount of attorney's fees awarded againstthe defendant. If the award of attorney's fees is not
greater than 150 percent of the judgment, the excessshall be paid by the defendant.

"(3) No award of attorney's fees in an action describedin paragraph (1) shall be based on an hourly rate greater

than 150 percent of the hourly rate established undersection 3006A of title 18 for payment of court-appointed

counsel." 42 U. S. C. $ 1997e(d) (1994 ed., Supp. III).
At issue here is whether $ 803(d) governs post-April 26,1996, fee awards in two lawsuits commenced before that

date. In Glover v. Johnson, 478 F. Supp. 1075 (ED Mich.1979), a class of female Michigan inmates filed an action
under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 (1994 ed., Supp. III) against variousMichigan prison officials (State) in 1977; the

Glover plaintiffsalleged principally that they were denied vocational and educational opportunities afforded their male counterparts, inviolation of the Equal Protection Clause. Ruling in plaintiffs' favor, the District Court entered a remedial order andretained jurisdiction over the case pending defendants' substantial compliance with that order. See Glover v. Johnson,510 F. Supp. 1019, 1020 (ED Mich. 1981). Under a 1985 ruling governing fee awards, plaintiffs' counsel applied for feesand costs twice yearly. See Hadix v. Johnson, 143 F. 3d 246,
248 (CA6 1998).In Hadix v. Johnson, a class of male Michigan inmates filed
a $ 1983 action against the State in 1980, alleging that theconditions of their confinement violated the First, Eighth,
Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments. In 1985, the partiesentered into a consent decree governing sanitation, health
care, fire safety, overcrowding, court access, and other as-pects of prison life. The District Court retained jurisdiction over the case pending substantial compliance with thedecree. Plaintiffs' attorneys remain responsible for monitoring compliance with the decree. In 1987, the DistrictCourt entered an order governing the award of fees and
costs to plaintiffs' counsel for compliance monitoring. Seeid., at 249.

Counsel for plaintiffs in both cases filed fee applications forcompensation at the court-approved market-based level of
$150 per hour for work performed between January 1, 1996,and June 30, 1996. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 27a, 33a. The

State objected, arguing that $ 803(d) limits all fees awarded
after April 26, 1996, in these litigations to $112.50 per hour.
Id., at 34a. In separate but nearly identical opinions, the
District Court refused to apply $ 803(d)'s fee limitation to
work performed before the PLRA's effective date, see id.,
at 28a, n. 1; id., at 34a, n. 1, but applied the limitation to all
work performed thereafter, see id., at 31a, 41a.

Relying on its recent decision in Glover v. Johnson, 138
F. 3d 229 (1998), the Sixth Circuit affirmed the District
Court's refusal to apply $ 803(d) to work completed preenactment. See 143 F. 3d, at 248. The appeals court reversed the District Court's judgment, however, to the extent
that it applied $ 803(d) to work performed postenactment.
See id., at 255-256. Unpersuaded that Congress intended
the PLRA attorney's fees provisions to apply retroactively,
the panel held that $ 803(d) "is inapplicable to cases brought
before the statute was enacted whether the underlying work
was performed before or after the enactment date of the
statute." Ibid.

II

In Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U. S. 244 (1994),
we reaffirmed the Court's longstanding presumption against
retroactive application of the law. "If [a] statute would operate retroactively," we held, "our traditional presumption
teaches that it does not govern absent clear congressional
intent favoring such a result." Id., at 280.

Emphasizing that $ 803(d) applies to "any action brought
by a prisoner who is confined," the State insists that the
statute's plain terms reveal Congress' intent to limit fees in
pending as well as future cases. See Brief for Petitioners
14-15 (emphases deleted; internal quotation marks omitted).
As the Court recognizes, however, $ 803(d)'s "any action
brought" language refers to the provision's substantive scope,
not its temporal reach, see ante, at 353-354; "any" appears
in the text only in proximity to provisions identifying the

368 MARTIN v. HADIX

Opinion of Ginsburg, J.
law's substantive dimensions.1 Had Congress intended that$ 803(d) apply retroactively, it might easily have specified, as

the Court suggests, that all postenactment awards shall besubject to the limitation, see ante, at 354, or prescribed
that the provision "shall apply in all proceedings pendingon or commenced after the date of enactment of this Act."
Congress instead left unaddressed $ 803(d)'s temporal reach.Comparison of $ 803(d)'s text with that of a neighboring
provision, $ 802(b)(1) of the PLRA, is instructive for theretroactivity question we face. Section 802(b)(1), which
governs "appropriate remedies" in prison litigation, appliesexpressly to "all prospective relief whether such relief was
originally granted or approved before, on, or after thedate of the enactment of this title." 110 Stat. 1321-70, note
following 18 U. S. C. $ 3626. "Congress [thus] saw fit to tellus which part of the Act was to be retroactively applied,"
i. e., $ 802. Jensen v. Clarke, 94 F. 3d 1191, 1203 (CA8 1996).While I agree with the Court that the negative implication
created by these two provisions is not dispositive, see ante,at 357, Congress' silence nevertheless suggests that $ 803(d)
has no carryback thrust.Absent an express statutory command respecting retroactivity, Landgraf teaches, the attorney's fees provisionshould not be applied to pending cases if doing so would
"have retroactive effect." 511 U. S., at 280. As the Courtrecognizes, see

ante, at 360, application of $ 803(d) to workperformed before the PLRA's effective date would be impermissibly retroactive. Instead of the court-approved

1 Section 803(d) is thus unlike the unenacted provision discussed in
Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U. S. 244, 260 (1994), which would
have made the statute at issue in that case applicable " `to all proceedings pending on or commenced after' " the effective date. Because this
language would have linked the word "all" directly to the statute's temporal scope, we recognized that it might have qualified as a clear statement of retroactive effect. The word "any" is not similarly tied to the
temporal scope of the PLRA, however, and so the inference suggested in
the Landgraf discussion is not permissible here.

Opinion of Ginsburg, J.
market-based fee that attorneys anticipated for work per-formed under the old regime, counsel would be limited to

the new statutory rate. We long ago recognized the injus-tice of interpreting a statute to reduce the level of compensation for work already performed. See United States v.
Heth, 3 Cranch 399, 408-409 (1806) (precluding, as impermis-sibly retroactive, application of a statute reducing customs

collectors' commissions to customs collected before enact-ment, even when the commission was due after the statute's
effective date). III

In my view, $ 803(d) is most soundly read to cover all, andonly, representations undertaken after the PLRA's effective
date. Application of $ 803(d) to representations commencedbefore the PLRA became law would "attac[h] new legal consequences to [an] even[t] completed before [the statute's] en-actment"; hence the application would be retroactive under
Landgraf. 511 U. S., at 270. The critical event effectedbefore the PLRA's effective date is the lawyer's undertaking to prosecute the client's civil rights claim. Applying$ 803(d) to pending matters significantly alters the consequences of the representation on which the lawyer has em-barked.

2 Notably, attorneys engaged before passage of the

PLRA have little leeway to alter their conduct in responseto the new legal regime; an attorney who initiated a prisoner's rights suit before April 26, 1996, remains subject to aprofessional obligation to see the litigation through to final
disposition. See ABA Model Rule of Professional Conduct1.3, and Comment [3] (1999) ("[A] lawyer should carry

2 An attorney's decision to invest time and energy in a civil rights suit
necessarily involves a complex balance of factors, including the likelihood
of success, the amount of labor necessary to prosecute the case to completion, and the potential recovery. Applying $ 803(d) to PLRA representations ongoing before April 26, 1996, effectively reduces the value of
the lawyer's prior investment in the litigation, and disappoints reasonable
reliance on the law in place at the time of the lawyer's undertaking.

through to conclusion all matters undertaken for a client.").
Counsel's actions before and after that date are thus "inextricab[ly] part of a course of conduct initiated prior to the
law." Inmates of D. C. Jail v. Jackson, 158 F. 3d 1357, 1362
(CADC 1998) (Wald, J., dissenting).

While the injustice in applying the fee limitations to pending actions may be more readily apparent regarding work
performed before the PLRA's effective date, application of
the statute to work performed thereafter in pending cases
also frustrates reasonable reliance on prior law and courtapproved market rates. Consider, for example, two attorneys who filed similar prison reform lawsuits at the same
time, pre-PLRA. Both attorneys initiated their lawsuits
in the expectation that, if they prevailed, they would earn
the market rate anticipated by pre-PLRA law. In one
case, the lawsuit progressed swiftly, and labor-intensive
pretrial discovery was completed before April 26, 1996.
In the other, the suit lagged through no fault of plaintiff 's
counsel, pending the court's disposition of threshold motions,
and the attorney was unable to pursue discovery until after
April 26, 1996.3 Both attorneys have prosecuted their
claims with due diligence; both were obliged, having accepted the representations, to perform the work for which
they seek compensation. There is scarcely greater injustice
in denying pre-PLRA compensation for pretrial discovery
in the one case than the other. Nor is there any reason to
think that Congress intended these similarly situated attorneys to be treated differently.

The Court avoids a conclusion of retroactivity by dismissing as an unsupported assumption the attorneys' assertion
of an obligation to continue their representations through to

3 If counsel's conduct caused delay or protraction, the court could properly exercise discretion to deny or reduce the attorney's fee. See 42
U. S. C. $ 1988(b) (1994 ed., Supp. III) ("[T]he court, in its discretion, may
allow . . . a reasonable attorney's fee.").

Opinion of Ginsburg, J.
final disposition. See ante, at 361. It seems to me, how-ever, that the assertion has secure support.

Like the ABA's Model Rules, the Michigan Rules of Pro-fessional Conduct (1999), which apply to counsel in both
Hadix and Glover, see Rule 83.20( j), provide that absent
good cause for terminating a representation, "a lawyershould carry through to conclusion all matters undertaken

for a client." Rule 1.3, Comment. It is true that with-drawal may be permitted where "the representation will result in an unreasonable financial burden on the lawyer," Rule1.16(b)(5), but explanatory comments suggest that this exception is designed for situations in which "the client refuses
to abide by the terms of an agreement relating to the representation, such as an agreement concerning fees," Rule 1.16,
Comment. Consistent with the Michigan Rules, counsel for
petitioners affirmed at oral argument their ethical obligation
to continue these representations to a natural conclusion.
See Tr. of Oral Arg. 43 ("[Continuing the representation]
does involve ethical concerns certainly, especially in the[se]
circumstance[s]."). There is no reason to think counsel ethically could have abandoned these representations in response to the PLRA fee limitation, nor any basis to believe
the trial court would have permitted counsel to withdraw.
See Rule 1.16(c) ("When ordered to do so by a tribunal, a
lawyer shall continue representation."). As I see it, the
attorneys' pre-PLRA pursuit of the civil rights claims thus
created an obligation, enduring post-PLRA, to continue to
provide effective representation.

Accordingly, I conclude that the Sixth Circuit soundly
resisted the "sophisticated construction," 143 F. 3d, at 252,
that would split apart, for fee award purposes, a constant
course of representation. "[T]he triggering event for retroactivity purposes," I am persuaded, "is when the lawyer undertakes to litigate the civil rights action on behalf of the
client." Inmates of D. C. Jail, 158 F. 3d, at 1362 (Wald, J.,
dissenting).

when it wants new rules to govern pending cases. Because$ 803(d) contains no clear statement on its temporal reach,
and because the provision would operate retroactively as ap-plied to lawsuits pending on the Act's effective date, I would
hold that the fee limitation applies only to cases commencedafter April 26, 1996.

373OCTOBER TERM, 1998
Syllabus

JONES v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fifth circuit

No. 97-9361. Argued February 22, 1999--Decided June 21, 1999
Petitioner was sentenced to death for the crime of kidnaping resulting in

the victim's death. Petitioner's sentence was imposed pursuant to the
Federal Death Penalty Act of 1994, 18 U. S. C. $ 3591 et seq. At the
sentencing hearing, the District Court instructed the jury and provided
it with four decision forms on which to record its sentencing recommendation. The court refused petitioner's request to instruct the jury as
to the consequences of jury deadlock. The jury unanimously recommended that petitioner be sentenced to death. The District Court imposed sentence in accordance with the jury's recommendation, and the
Fifth Circuit affirmed.

Held: The judgment is affirmed.
132 F. 3d 232, affirmed.

Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to
Parts I, II, and III-B, concluding:

1. The Eighth Amendment does not require that a jury be instructed
as to the consequences of their failure to agree. Pp. 379-384.

(a) As petitioner argues, the Federal Death Penalty Act requires
judge sentencing when the jury, after retiring for deliberations, reports
itself as unable to reach a unanimous verdict. In such a case, the
sentencing duty falls upon the District Court pursuant to 18 U. S. C.

$ 3594. Pp. 379-381.

(b) The Eighth Amendment, however, does not require that a jury
be instructed as to the consequences of a breakdown in the deliberative
process. Such an instruction has no bearing on the jury's role in the
sentencing process. Moreover, the jury system's very object is to secure unanimity, and the Government has a strong interest in having the
jury express the conscience of the community on the ultimate life or
death question. A charge of the sort petitioner suggests might well
undermine this strong governmental interest. In addition, Congress
chose not to require such an instruction be given. The Court declines
to invoke its supervisory powers over the federal courts and require
that such an instruction be given in every capital case in these circumstances. Pp. 381-384.

2. There is no reasonable likelihood that the jury was led to believe
that petitioner would receive a court-imposed sentence less than life

527US1 Unit: $U80 [05-09-01 13:00:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN
374 JONES v. UNITED STATES

Syllabus
imprisonment in the event they could not recommend unanimously a
sentence of death or life imprisonment without the possibility of release. Pp. 384-395.

(a) Petitioner claims that the instruction pertaining to the jury's
sentencing recommendation, in combination with the Decision Forms,
led to confusion warranting reversal of his sentence under the Due Process Clause, the Eighth Amendment, and the Act. Because petitioner
did not voice the objections that he now raises before the jury retired,
see Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 30, his claim of error is subject to a limited
appellate review for plain error, e. g., Johnson v. United States, 520 U. S.
461, 465-466. Pp. 384-389.

(b) Under that review, relief is not warranted unless there has been
(1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) affects substantial rights. Petitioner's
argument falls short of satisfying even the first requirement, for no
error occurred. The proper standard for reviewing claims that allegedly ambiguous instructions caused jury confusion is whether there is a
reasonable likelihood that the jury applied the challenged instruction in
a way that violates the Constitution. There is no such likelihood here.
The District Court gave no explicit instructions on the consequences of
nonunanimity; and the passages that petitioner argues led to jury confusion, when viewed in the context of the entire instructions, lack any
ambiguity. Nor did the Decision Forms or their accompanying instructions create a reasonable likelihood of confusion over the effect of nonunanimity. The District Court's explicit instruction that the jury had
to be unanimous and its exhortation to the jury to discuss the punishment and to attempt to reach agreement make it doubtful that the jury
thought it was compelled to recommend a lesser sentence in the event of
a disagreement. Even assuming, arguendo, that a plain error occurred,
petitioner cannot show that it affected his substantial rights. The District Court admonished the jury not to concern itself with the effect of
a lesser sentence recommendation. Moreover, assuming that the jurors
were confused over the consequences of deadlock, petitioner cannot
show the confusion necessarily worked to his detriment. It is just as
likely that the jurors, loathe to recommend a lesser sentence, would
have compromised on a life imprisonment sentence as on a death sentence. Cf. Romano v. Oklahoma, 512 U. S. 1, 14. Pp. 389-395.

3. Assuming, arguendo, that the District Court erred in allowing the
jury to consider nonstatutory aggravating factors that were vague,
overbroad, or duplicative in violation of the Eighth Amendment, such
error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. An appellate court
may conduct harmless-error review by considering either whether absent an invalid factor, the jury would have reached the same verdict or
whether the result would have been the same had the invalid aggravat527US1 Unit: $U80 [05-09-01 13:00:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
ing factor been precisely defined. See Clemons v. Mississippi, 494
U. S. 738, 753-754. The Fifth Circuit performed the first sort of analysis, and its explanation appears sufficient. Even if its analysis was too
perfunctory, it is plain, under the alternative mode of harmless-error
analysis, that the error indeed was harmless. Had the nonstatutory
aggravating factors been precisely defined in writing, the jury would
have reached the same recommendation as it did. The Government's
argument to the jury cured the factors of any infirmity as written.
Pp. 402-405.

Petitioner was sentenced to death for committing a kid-naping resulting in death to the victim. His sentence was

less than life imprisonment in the event that they could notreach a unanimous sentence recommendation; and whether

the submission to the jury of two allegedly duplicative,vague, and overbroad nonstatutory aggravating factors was
harmless error. We answer "no" to the first two questions.As for the third, we are of the view that there was no error
in allowing the jury to consider the challenged factors. As-suming error,

arguendo, we think it clear that such errorwas harmless.

I
Petitioner Louis Jones, Jr., kidnaped Private Tracie JoyMcBride at gunpoint from the Goodfellow Air Force Base in

San Angelo, Texas. He brought her to his house and sexu-ally assaulted her. Soon thereafter, petitioner drove Private McBride to a bridge just outside of San Angelo, wherehe repeatedly struck her in the head with a tire iron until
she died. Petitioner administered blows of such severeforce that, when the victim's body was found, the medical
examiners observed that large pieces of her skull had beendriven into her cranial cavity or were missing.

The Government charged petitioner with, inter alia, kid-naping with death resulting to the victim, in violation of 18
U. S. C. $ 1201(a)(2), an offense punishable by life imprison-ment or death. Exercising its discretion under the Federal
Death Penalty Act of 1994, 18 U. S. C. $ 3591 et seq., theGovernment decided to seek the latter sentencing option.
Petitioner was tried in the District Court for the NorthernDistrict of Texas and found guilty by the jury.

The District Court then conducted a separate sentencinghearing pursuant to $ 3593. As an initial matter, the sentencing jury was required to find that petitioner had the req-uisite intent, see $ 3591(a)(2); it concluded that petitioner
intentionally killed his victim and intentionally inflictedserious bodily injury resulting in her death. Even on a
finding of intent, however, a defendant is not death eligibleunless the sentencing jury also finds that the Government

Opinion of the Court
has proved beyond a reasonable doubt at least one of the
statutory aggravating factors set forth at $ 3592. See

$ 3593(e). Because petitioner was charged with committing
a homicide, the Government had to prove 1 of the 16 statutory aggravating factors set forth at 18 U. S. C. $ 3592(c)
(1994 ed. and Supp. III) (different statutory aggravating factors for other crimes punishable by death are set forth at

$$ 3592(b), (d)). The jury unanimously found that two such
factors had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt--it
agreed that petitioner caused the death of his victim during
the commission of another crime, see $ 3592(c)(1), and that he
committed the offense in an especially heinous, cruel, and
depraved manner, see $ 3592(c)(6).1

Once petitioner became death eligible, the jury had to decide whether he should receive a death sentence. In making
the selection decision, the Act requires that the sentencing
jury consider all of the aggravating and mitigating factors
and determine whether the former outweigh the latter (or,
if there are no mitigating factors, whether the aggravating
factors alone are sufficient to warrant a death sentence).

$$ 3591(a), 3592, 3593(e). The Act, however, requires more
exacting proof of aggravating factors than mitigating ones--
although a jury must unanimously agree that the Government established the existence of an aggravating factor beyond a reasonable doubt, $ 3593(c), the jury may consider a
mitigating factor in its weighing process so long as one juror
finds that the defendant established its existence by preponderance of the evidence, $$ 3593(c), (d). In addition to the

1 As phrased on the Special Findings Form returned by the jury, the
statutory aggravating factors read:

"2(A). The defendant LOUIS JONES caused the death of Tracie Joy
McBride, or injury resulting in the death of Tracie Joy McBride, which
occurred during the commission of the offense of Kidnapping."

"2(C). The defendant LOUIS JONES committed the offense in an especially heinous, cruel, and depraved manner in that it involved torture or
serious physical abuse to Tracie Joy McBride." App. 51-52.

Opinion of the Court
two statutory aggravators that established petitioner's death
eligibility, the jury also unanimously found two aggravators
of the nonstatutory variety 2 had been proved: One set forth
victim impact evidence and the other victim vulnerability
evidence.3 As for mitigating factors, at least one juror found
10 of the 11 that petitioner proposed and seven jurors wrote
in a factor petitioner had not raised on the Special Findings
Form.4

2 The term "nonstatutory aggravating factor" is used to refer to any
aggravating factor that is not specifically described in 18 U. S. C. $ 3592.
Section 3592(c) provides that the jury may consider "whether any other
aggravating factor for which notice has been given exists." Pursuant to

$ 3593(a), when the Government decides to seek the death penalty, it must
provide notice of the aggravating factors that it proposes to prove as justifying a sentence of death.

3 As phrased on the Special Findings Form, the nonstatutory aggravating factors read:

"3(B). Tracie Joy McBride's young age, her slight stature, her background, and her unfamiliarity with San Angelo, Texas.

"3(C). Tracie Joy McBride's personal characteristics and the effect of
the instant offense on Tracie Joy McBride's family constitute an aggravating factor of the offense." App. 53.

4 The mitigating factors that the jury found as set forth on the Special

Findings Form (along with the number of jurors that found for each factor
in brackets) are as follows:

"1. That the defendant Louis Jones did not have a significant prior criminal record." [6]

"2. That the defendant Louis Jones' capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of the defendant's conduct or to conform to the requirements of law
was significantly impaired, regardless of whether the capacity was so impaired as to constitute a defense to the charge." [2]

"3. That the defendant Louis Jones committed the offense under severe
mental or emotional disturbance." [1]

"4. That the defendant Louis Jones was subjected to physical, sexual,
and emotional abuse as a child (and was deprived of sufficient parental
protection that he needed)." [4]

Opinion of the Court
After weighing the aggravating and mitigating factors, thejury unanimously recommended that petitioner be sentenced

to death. App. 57-58. The District Court imposed sen-tence in accordance with the jury's recommendation pursuant to $ 3594. The United States Court of Appeals for theFifth Circuit affirmed the sentence. 132 F. 3d 232 (1998).
We granted certiorari, 525 U. S. 809 (1998), and now affirm.

A

We first decide the question whether petitioner was enti-tled to an instruction as to the consequences of jury deadlock. Petitioner requested, in relevant part, the followinginstruction:

"In the event, after due deliberation and reflection, thejury is unable to agree on a unanimous decision as to the
sentence to be imposed, you should so advise me andI will impose a sentence of life imprisonment without
possibility of release. . . ."In the event you are unable to agree on [a sentence
of] Life Without Possibility of Release or Death, but youare unanimous that the sentence should not be less than
Life Without Possibility of Release, you should reportthat vote to the Court and the Court will sentence the
defendant to Life Without the Possibility of Release."App. 14-15.

"7. That the defendant Louis Jones is remorseful for the crime he committed." [4]

"8. That the defendant Louis Jones' daughter will be harmed by the
emotional trauma of her father's execution." [9]

"9. That the defendant Louis Jones was under unusual and substantial
internally generated duress and stress at the time of the offense." [3]

"10. That the defendant Louis Jones suffered from numerous neurological or psychological disorders at the time of the offense." [1] Id., at 54-56.

Seven jurors added petitioner's ex-wife as a mitigating factor without
further elaboration. Id., at 56.

380 JONES v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
In petitioner's view, the Eighth Amendment requires that
the jurors be instructed as to the effect of their inability to
agree. He alternatively argues that we should invoke our
supervisory power over the federal courts and require that
such an instruction be given.

Before we turn to petitioner's Eighth Amendment argument, a question of statutory interpretation calls for our attention. The Fifth Circuit held that the District Court did
not err in refusing petitioner's requested instruction because
it was not substantively correct. See 132 F. 3d, at 242-243.
According to the Court of Appeals, $ 3593(b)(2)(C), which
provides that a new jury shall be impaneled for a new sentencing hearing if the guilt phase jury is discharged for
"good cause," requires the District Court to impanel a second
jury and hold a second sentencing hearing in the event of
jury deadlock. Id., at 243. The Government interprets the
statute the same way (although its reading is more nuanced)
and urges that the judgment below be affirmed on this
ground.

Petitioner, however, reads the Act differently. In his
view, whenever the jury reaches a result other than a unanimous verdict recommending a death sentence or life imprisonment without the possibility of release, the duty of
sentencing falls upon the district court pursuant to $ 3594,
which reads:

"Upon a recommendation under section 3593(e) that
the defendant should be sentenced to death or life imprisonment without possibility of release, the court shall
sentence the defendant accordingly. Otherwise, the
court shall impose any lesser sentence that is authorized
by law. Notwithstanding any other law, if the maximum term of imprisonment for the offense is life imprisonment, the court may impose a sentence of life imprisonment without possibility of release."

381Cite as: 527 U. S. 373 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
Petitioner's argument is based on his construction of the
term "[o]therwise." He argues that this term means that
when the jury, after retiring for deliberations, reports itself
as unable to reach a unanimous verdict, the sentencing determination passes to the court.

As the dissent also concludes, post, at 417-418, petitioner's
view of the statute is the better one. The phrase "good
cause" in $ 3593(b)(2)(C) plainly encompasses events such as
juror disqualification, but cannot be read so expansively as
to include the jury's failure to reach a unanimous decision.
Nevertheless, the Eighth Amendment does not require that
the jurors be instructed as to the consequences of their failure to agree.

To be sure, we have said that the Eighth Amendment requires that a sentence of death not be imposed arbitrarily.
See, e. g., Buchanan v. Angelone, 522 U. S. 269, 275 (1998).
In order for a capital sentencing scheme to pass constitutional muster, it must perform a narrowing function with
respect to the class of persons eligible for the death penalty
and must also ensure that capital sentencing decisions rest
upon an individualized inquiry. Ibid. The instruction that
petitioner requested has no bearing on what we have called
the "eligibility phase" of the capital sentencing process. As
for what we have called the "selection phase," our cases have
held that in order to satisfy the requirement that capital sentencing decisions rest upon an individualized inquiry, a
scheme must allow a "broad inquiry" into all "constitutionally relevant mitigating evidence." Id., at 276. Petitioner
does not argue, nor could he, that the District Court's failure
to give the requested instruction prevented the jury from
considering such evidence.

In theory, the District Court's failure to instruct the jury
as to the consequences of deadlock could give rise to an
Eighth Amendment problem of a different sort: We also have
held that a jury cannot be "affirmatively misled regarding its

527US1 Unit: $U80 [05-09-01 13:00:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN
382 JONES v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
role in the sentencing process." Romano v. Oklahoma, 512U. S. 1, 9 (1994). In no way, however, was the jury affirmatively misled by the District Court's refusal to give petition-er's proposed instruction. The truth of the matter is that
the proposed instruction has no bearing on the jury's role inthe sentencing process. Rather, it speaks to what happens
in the event that the jury is unable to fulfill its role--whendeliberations break down and the jury is unable to produce
a unanimous sentence recommendation. Petitioner's argu-ment, although less than clear, appears to be that a death
sentence is arbitrary within the meaning of the EighthAmendment if the jury is not given any bit of information
that might possibly influence an individual juror's voting be-havior. That contention has no merit. We have never suggested, for example, that the Eighth Amendment requires ajury be instructed as to the consequences of a breakdown in
the deliberative process. On the contrary, we have longbeen of the view that "[t]he very object of the jury system
is to secure unanimity by a comparison of views, and by ar-guments among the jurors themselves."

Allen v. UnitedStates, 164 U. S. 492, 501 (1896).
5 We further have recognized that in a capital sentencing proceeding, the Govern-ment has "a strong interest in having the jury express the

conscience of the community on the ultimate question of lifeor death."

Lowenfield v. Phelps, 484 U. S. 231, 238 (1988)(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). We are of

the view that a charge to the jury of the sort proposed bypetitioner might well have the effect of undermining this
strong governmental interest.6

5 We have thus approved of the use of a supplemental charge to encourage a jury reporting itself as deadlocked to engage in further deliberations, see Allen v. United States, 164 U. S., at 501, even capital sentencing
juries, see Lowenfield v. Phelps, 484 U. S. 231, 237-241 (1988).

6 It is not insignificant that the Courts of Appeals to have addressed this

question, as far as we are aware, are uniform in rejecting the argument
that the Constitution requires an instruction as to the consequences of a
jury's inability to agree. See, e. g., Coe v. Bell, 161 F. 3d 320, 339-340

383Cite as: 527 U. S. 373 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
We similarly decline to exercise our supervisory powers torequire that an instruction on the consequences of deadlock

be given in every capital case. In drafting the Act, Con-gress chose not to require such an instruction. Cf. $ 3593(f)
(district court "shall instruct the jury that, in consideringwhether a sentence of death is justified, it shall not consider
the race, color, religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of thedefendant or of any victim and that the jury is not to recommend a sentence of death unless it has concluded that itwould recommend a sentence of death for the crime in question no matter what the race, color, religious beliefs, nationalorigin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim may be").
Petitioner does point us to a decision from the New JerseySupreme Court requiring, in an exercise of that court's supervisory authority, that the jury be informed of the sentenc-ing consequences of nonunanimity. See New Jersey v. Ramseur, 106 N. J. 123, 304-315, 524 A. 2d 188, 280-286 (1987).Of course, New Jersey's practice has no more relevance to
our decision than the power to persuade. Several otherStates have declined to require a similar instruction. See,
e. g., North Carolina v. McCarver, 341 N. C. 364, 394, 462S. E. 2d 25, 42 (1995);

Brogie v. Oklahoma, 695 P. 2d 538, 547(Okla. Crim. App. 1985); Calhoun v. Maryland, 297 Md. 563,

593-595, 468 A. 2d 45, 58-60 (1983); Coulter v. Alabama, 438So. 2d 336, 346 (Ala. Crim. App. 1982); Justus v. Virginia,
220 Va. 971, 979, 266 S. E. 2d 87, 92-93 (1980). We find thereasoning of the Virginia Supreme Court in

Justus far morepersuasive than that of the New Jersey Supreme Court, especially in light of the strong governmental interest thatwe have recognized in having the jury render a unanimous
sentence recommendation:
(CA6 1998); Green v. French, 143 F. 3d 865, 890 (CA4 1998); United States
v. Chandler, 996 F. 2d 1073, 1088-1089 (CA11 1993); Evans v. Thompson,
881 F. 2d 117, 123-124 (CA4 1989). Indeed, the Fifth Circuit, in the alternative, reached the same conclusion in this very case. See 132 F. 3d 232,
245 (1998).

384 JONES v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
"The court properly refused an instruction offered bythe defendant which would have told the jury that if it

could not reach agreement as to the appropriate punish-ment, the court would dismiss it and impose a life sentence. While this was a correct statement of law it concerned a procedural matter and was not one whichshould have been the subject of an instruction. It

would have been an open invitation for the jury to avoidits responsibility and to disagree."

Id., at 979, 266 S. E.
2d, at 92.

In light of the legitimate reasons for not instructing the jury
as to the consequences of deadlock, and in light of congres-sional silence, we will not exercise our supervisory powers

to require that an instruction of the sort petitioner soughtbe given in every case. Cf.

Shannon v. United States, 512
U. S. 573, 587 (1994). B

Petitioner further argues that the jury was led to believethat if it could not reach a unanimous sentence recommendation he would receive a judge-imposed sentence less severe
than life imprisonment, and his proposed instruction as to
the consequences of deadlock was necessary to correct the
jury's erroneous impression. Moreover, he contends that
the alleged confusion independently warrants reversal of his
sentence under the Due Process Clause, the Eighth Amendment, and the Act itself. He grounds his due process claim
in the assertion that sentences may not be based on materially untrue assumptions, his Eighth Amendment claim in his
contention that the jury is entitled to accurate sentencing
information, and his statutory claim in an argument that jury
confusion over the available sentencing options constitutes
an "arbitrary factor" under $ 3595(c)(2)(A).

To put petitioner's claim in the proper context, we must
briefly review the jury instructions and sentencing proce527US1 Unit: $U80 [05-09-01 13:00:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
dures used at trial. After instructing the jury on the aggravating and mitigating factors and explaining the process
of weighing those factors, the District Court gave the following instructions pertaining to the jury's sentencing
recommendation:

"Based upon this consideration, you the jury, by unanimous vote, shall recommend whether the defendant
should be sentenced to death, sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of release, or sentenced to
some other lesser sentence.

"If you unanimously conclude that the aggravating
factors found to exist sufficiently outweigh any mitigating factor or factors found to exist, or in the absence of
any mitigating factors, that the aggravating factors are
themselves sufficient to justify a sentence of death, you
may recommend a sentence of death. Keep in mind,
however, that regardless of your findings with respect
to aggravating and mitigating factors, you are never
required to recommend a death sentence.

"If you recommend the imposition of a death sentence,
the court is required to impose that sentence. If you
recommend a sentence of life without the possibility of
release, the court is required to impose that sentence.
If you recommend that some other lesser sentence be
imposed, the court is required to impose a sentence that
is authorized by the law. In deciding what recommendation to make, you are not to be concerned with the
question of what sentence the defendant might receive
in the event you determine not to recommend a death
sentence or a sentence of life without the possibility of
release. That is a matter for the court to decide in
the event you conclude that a sentence of death or life
without the possibility of release should not be recommended." App. 43-44.

386 JONES v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
The District Court also provided the jury with four de-cision forms on which to record its recommendation.

7 In

its instructions explaining those forms, the District Courttold the jury that its choice of form depended on its

recommendation:

"The forms are self-explanatory: Decision Form Ashould be used if you determine that a sentence of death

should not be imposed because the government failed toprove beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of the
required intent on the part of the defendant or a re-quired aggravating factor. Decision Form B should be
used if you unanimously recommend that a sentence ofdeath should be imposed. Decision Form C or Decision
Form D should be used if you determine that a sentenceof death should not be imposed because: (1) you do not
unanimously find that the aggravating factor or factorsfound to exist sufficiently outweigh any mitigating factor
or factors found to exist; (2) you do not unanimously findthat the aggravating factor or factors found to exist are

7 The decision forms read as follows:
"DECISION FORM A

"We the jury have determined that a sentence of death should not be
imposed because the government has failed to prove beyond a reasonable
doubt the existence of the required intent on the part of the defendant or
a required aggravating factor."

"DECISION FORM B

"Based upon consideration of whether the aggravating factor or factors
found to exist sufficiently outweigh any mitigating factor or factors found
to exist, or in the absence of any mitigating factors, whether the aggravating factor or factors are themselves sufficient to justify a sentence of
death, we recommend, by unanimous vote, that a sentence of death be
imposed."

"DECISION FORM C

"We the jury recommend, by unanimous verdict, a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of release."

"DECISION FORM D

"We the jury recommend some other lesser sentence." App. 57-59.

themselves sufficient to justify a sentence of deathwhere no mitigating factor has been found to exist; or

(3) regardless of your findings with respect to aggravat-ing and mitigating factors you are not unanimous in recommending that a sentence of death should be imposed.Decision Form C should be used if you unanimously recommend that a sentence of imprisonment for life withoutthe possibility of release should be imposed.

"Decision Form D should be used if you recommendthat some other lesser sentence should be imposed."
Id., at 47-48.
Petitioner maintains that the instructions in combinationwith the decision forms led the jury to believe that if

it failed to recommend unanimously a sentence of death orlife imprisonment without the possibility of release, then it
would be required to use Decision Form D and the courtwould impose a sentence less than life imprisonment.

8 The

scope of our review is shaped by whether petitioner properlyraised and preserved an objection to the instructions at trial.

A party generally may not assign error to a jury instructionif he fails to object before the jury retires or to "stat[e] distinctly the matter to which that party objects and thegrounds of the objection." Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 30.
These timeliness and specificity requirements apply duringthe sentencing phase as well as the trial. See 18 U. S. C.

$ 3595(c)(2)(C); see also Fed. Rules Crim. Proc. 1, 54(a).They enable a trial court to correct any instructional mis8 Petitioner does not argue that the District Court's instructions on the
lesser sentence option, standing alone, constituted reversible error although the parties agree that, after the jury found petitioner guilty of
kidnaping resulting in death, the only possible sentences were death and
a life sentence. See Brief for Petitioner 18-19; Brief for United States
13, n. 2; see also 18 U. S. C. $ 1201. Petitioner made such an argument
below; the Fifth Circuit, however, concluded that the instructions as to
the lesser sentence option did not rise to the level of plain error. 132
F. 3d, at 246-248.

Opinion of the Court
takes before the jury retires and in that way help to avoidthe burdens of an unnecessary retrial. While an objection

in a directed verdict motion before the jury retires can pre-serve a claim of error,

Leary v. United States, 395 U. S. 6,
32 (1969), objections raised after the jury has completed its
deliberations do not. See Singer v. United States, 380 U. S.24, 38 (1965);

Lopez v. United States, 373 U. S. 427, 436 (1963);
cf. United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U. S. 150,238-239 (1940). Nor does a request for an instruction before

the jury retires preserve an objection to the instruction actu-ally given by the court. Otherwise, district judges would
have to speculate on what sorts of objections might be implied through a request for an instruction and issue rulings
on "implied" objections that a defendant never intends to
raise. Such a rule would contradict Rule 30's mandate that
a party state distinctly his grounds for objection.

Petitioner did not voice the objections to the instructions
and decision forms that he now raises before the jury retired.
See App. 16-33. While Rule 30 could be read literally to
bar any review of petitioner's claim of error, our decisions
instead have held that an appellate court may conduct a limited review for plain error. Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 52(b);
Johnson v. United States, 520 U. S. 461, 465-466 (1997);
United States v. Olano, 507 U. S. 725, 731-732 (1993); Lopez,
supra, at 436-437; Namet v. United States, 373 U. S. 179,
190-191 (1963). Petitioner, however, contends that the Federal Death Penalty Act creates an exception. He relies on
language in the Act providing that an appellate court shall
remand a case where it finds that "the sentence of death was
imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any
other arbitrary factor." $ 3595(c)(2)(A). According to petitioner, the alleged jury confusion over the available sentencing options is an arbitrary factor and thus warrants resentencing even if he did not properly preserve the objection.

This argument rests on an untenable reading of the Act.
The statute does not explicitly announce an exception to

527US1 Unit: $U80 [05-09-01 13:00:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN

389Cite as: 527 U. S. 373 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
plain-error review, and a congressional intent to create suchan exception cannot be inferred from the overall scheme.

Statutory language must be read in context and a phrase"gathers meaning from the words around it."

Jarecki v.
G. D. Searle & Co., 367 U. S. 303, 307 (1961); see also Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., 513 U. S. 561, 575 (1995). Here, the samesubsection that petitioner relies upon further provides that

reversal is warranted where "the proceedings involvedany other legal error requiring reversal of the sentence that
was properly preserved for appeal under the rules of crimi-nal procedure." $ 3595(c)(2)(C). This language makes clear
that Congress sought to impose a timely objection requirement at sentencing and did not intend to equate the phrase
"arbitrary factor" with legal error. Petitioner's broad interpretation of $ 3595(c)(2)(A) would drain $ 3595(c)(2)(C) of any
independent meaning.

We review the instructions, then, for plain error. Under
that review, relief is not warranted unless there has been
(1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) affects substantial rights.
Johnson, supra, at 467; Olano, supra, at 732. Appellate review under the plain-error doctrine, of course, is circumscribed and we exercise our power under Rule 52(b) sparingly. See United States v. Young, 470 U. S. 1, 15 (1985);

United States v. Frady, 456 U. S. 152, 163, and n. 14 (1982);
cf. Henderson v. Kibbe, 431 U. S. 145, 154 (1977) ("It is the
rare case in which an improper instruction will justify reversal of a criminal conviction when no objection has been made
in the trial court"). An appellate court should exercise its
discretion to correct plain error only if it "seriously affect[s]
the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings." Olano, supra, at 732 (internal quotation marks
omitted); Young, supra, at 15; United States v. Atkinson, 297
U. S. 157, 160 (1936).

Petitioner's argument--which depends on the premise
that the instructions and decision forms led the jury to believe that it did not have to recommend unanimously a lesser

527US1 Unit: $U80 [05-09-01 13:00:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN
390 JONES v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
sentence--falls short of satisfying even the first requirement
of the plain-error doctrine, for we cannot see that any error
occurred. We have considered similar claims that allegedly
ambiguous instructions caused jury confusion. See, e. g.,
Victor v. Nebraska, 511 U. S. 1 (1994); Estelle v. McGuire,
502 U. S. 62 (1991); Boyde v. California, 494 U. S. 370 (1990).
The proper standard for reviewing such claims is " `whether
there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury has applied the
challenged instruction in a way' that violates the Constitution." Estelle, supra, at 72 (quoting Boyde, supra, at 380);
see also Victor, supra, at 6 (applying reasonable likelihood
standard to direct review of state criminal conviction).9

There is no reasonable likelihood that the jury applied the
instructions incorrectly. The District Court did not expressly inform the jury that it would impose a lesser sentence in case of deadlock. It simply told the jury that, if
it recommended a lesser sentence, the court would impose
a sentence "authorized by the law." App. 44. Nor did the
District Court expressly require the jury to select Decision
Form D if it could not reach agreement. Instead, it exhorted the jury "to discuss the issue of punishment with one

9 Petitioner concedes that the Boyde standard applies to the extent that
he is advancing a constitutional claim, but relying on our prior decision in
Andres v. United States, 333 U. S. 740, 752 (1948), he contends that a more
lenient standard applies to the extent that he seeks relief under the statute directly. Our decisions in Boyde and Estelle, however, foreclose that
reading of Andres. In Boyde we noted that our prior decisions, including
Andres, had been "less than clear" in articulating a single workable standard for evaluating claims that an instruction prevented the jury's consideration of constitutionally relevant evidence. 494 U. S., at 378. In order to
supply "a single formulation for this Court and other courts to employ
in deciding this kind of federal question," we announced the "reasonable
likelihood" standard. Id., at 379. We made this same point later in Estelle, noting that "[i]n Boyde . . . we made it a point to settle on a single
standard of review for jury instructions--the `reasonable likelihood' standard--after considering the many different phrasings that had previously
been used by this Court." 502 U. S., at 72-73, n. 4.

Opinion of the Court
another in an effort to reach agreement, if you can do so."
Id., at 46.

Notwithstanding the absence of an explicit instruction onthe consequences of nonunanimity, petitioner identifies several passages which, he believes, support the inference that
the jury was confused on this point. He trains on that por-tion of the instructions telling the jurors that the court

would decide the sentence if they did not recommend a sen-tence of death or life without the possibility of release. Petitioner argues that this statement, coupled with two earlierreferences to a "lesser sentence" option, caused the jurors to
infer that the District Court would impose a lesser sentence
if they could not unanimously agree on a sentence of death
or life without the possibility of release. He maintains that
this inference is strengthened by a later instruction: "In
order to bring back a verdict recommending the punishment
of death or life without the possibility of release, all twelve
of you must unanimously vote in favor of such specific penalty." Id., at 45. According to petitioner, the failure to
mention the "lesser sentence" option in this statement
strongly implied that, in contradistinction to the first two
options, the "lesser sentence" option did not require jury
unanimity.

Petitioner parses these passages too finely. Our decisions
repeatedly have cautioned that instructions must be evaluated not in isolation but in the context of the entire charge.
See, e. g., Bryan v. United States, 524 U. S. 184, 199 (1998);
United States v. Park, 421 U. S. 658, 674 (1975); Cupp v.
Naughten, 414 U. S. 141, 147 (1973); Boyd v. United States,
271 U. S. 104, 107 (1926). We agree with the Fifth Circuit
that when these passages are viewed in the context of the
entire instructions, they lack ambiguity and cannot be given
the reading that petitioner advances. See 132 F. 3d, at 244.
We previously have held that instructions that might be ambiguous in the abstract can be cured when read in conjunction with other instructions. Bryan, supra, at 199; Victor,

Opinion of the Court
supra, at 14-15; Estelle, supra, at 74-75. Petitioner's claimis far weaker than those we evaluated in Bryan, Victor, and

Estelle because the jury in this case received an explicit in-struction that it had to be unanimous. Just prior to its admonition that the jury should not concern itself with the ulti-mate sentence if it does not recommend death or life without
the possibility of release, the trial court expressly instructedthe jury in unambiguous language that any sentencing recommendation had to be by a unanimous vote. Specifically,it stated that "you the jury, by unanimous vote, shall recommend whether the defendant should be sentenced to death,sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of release, or sentenced to some other lesser sentence." App. 43.Other instructions, by contrast, specified when the jury did
not have to act unanimously. For example, the DistrictCourt explicitly told the jury that its findings on the mitigating circumstances, unlike those on the aggravating circum-stances, did not have to be unanimous.

10 To be sure, the

District Court could have used the phrase "unanimously"more frequently. But when read alongside an unambiguous

charge that any sentencing recommendation be unanimousand other instructions explicitly identifying when the jury
need not be unanimous, the passages identified by petitionerdo not create a reasonable likelihood that the jury believed
that deadlock would cause the District Court to impose alesser sentence.

10 The relevant portion of the instruction read: "You will also recall that
I previously told you that all twelve of you had to unanimously agree that
a particular aggravating circumstance was proved beyond a reasonable
doubt before you consider it. Quite the opposite is true with regard to
mitigating factors. A finding with respect to a mitigating factor may be
made by any one or more of the members of the jury, and any member
who finds by a preponderance of the evidence the existence of a mitigating
factor may consider such factor established for his or her weighing of
aggravating and mitigating factors regardless of the number of other jurors who agree that such mitigating factor has been established." App.

Opinion of the Court
Petitioner also relies on alleged ambiguities in the decisionforms and the explanatory instructions. He stresses the

fact that Decision Form D (lesser sentence recommendation),unlike Decision Forms B (death sentence) and C (life without
the possibility of release), did not contain the phrase "by
unanimous vote" and required only the foreperson's signa-ture. These features of Decision Form D, according to petitioner, led the jury to conclude that nonunanimity wouldresult in a lesser sentence. According to petitioner, the instructions accompanying Decision Form D, unlike those re-specting Decision Forms B and C, did not mention unanimity,
thereby increasing the likelihood of confusion.

With respect to this aspect of petitioner's argument, we
agree with the Fifth Circuit that "[a]lthough the verdict
forms standing alone could have persuaded a jury to conclude that unanimity was not required for the lesser sentence
option, any confusion created by the verdict forms was clarified when considered in light of the entire jury instruction."
132 F. 3d, at 245. The District Court's explicit instruction
that the jury had to be unanimous and its exhortation to the
jury to discuss the punishment and attempt to reach agreement, App. 46, make it doubtful that the jury thought it
was compelled to employ Decision Form D in the event of
disagreement.

Petitioner also places too much weight on the fact that
Decision Form D required only the foreperson's signature.
Although it only contained a space for the foreperson's signature, Form D, like the others, used the phrase "We the jury
recommend . . . ," thereby signaling that Form D represented
the jury's recommendation. Id., at 59. Moreover, elsewhere, the jury foreperson alone signed the jury forms to
indicate the jury's unanimous agreement. Specifically, only
the jury foreperson signed the special findings form on which
the jury was required to indicate its unanimous agreement
that an aggravating factor had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Id., at 51-53. In these circumstances, we do

Opinion of the Court
not think that the decision forms or accompanying instructions created a reasonable likelihood of confusion over the
effect of nonunanimity.11

Even assuming, arguendo, that an error occurred (and that
it was plain), petitioner cannot show that it affected his substantial rights. Any confusion among the jurors over the
effect of a lesser sentence recommendation was allayed by
the District Court's admonition that the jury should not concern itself with the effect of such a recommendation. See
supra, at 390 (quoting App. 44). The jurors are presumed
to have followed these instructions. See Shannon, 512
U. S., at 585; Richardson v. Marsh, 481 U. S. 200, 206 (1987).
Even if the jurors had some lingering doubts about the effect of deadlock, therefore, the instructions made clear that
they should set aside their concerns and either report that
they were unable to reach agreement or recommend a lesser
sentence if they believed that this was the only option.

Moreover, even assuming that the jurors were confused
over the consequences of deadlock, petitioner cannot show
the confusion necessarily worked to his detriment. It is just
as likely that the jurors, loath to recommend a lesser sentence, would have compromised on a sentence of life imprisonment as on a death sentence. Where the effect of an al11 Petitioner also urges us to take cognizance of two affidavits prepared
after the jury had returned its sentencing recommendation. One affidavit, attached to petitioner's new trial motion, was executed by an investigator for the federal public defender after a juror had contacted the public
defender's office. Id., at 66-68. The other affidavit, attached to petitioner's motion to reconsider the District Court's order denying his motion for
a new trial, was executed by one of the jurors. Id., at 78-80. The Fifth
Circuit ruled that petitioner could not rely on these affidavits to undermine the jury's sentencing recommendation. 132 F. 3d, at 245-246. Petitioner did not raise this independent determination in any of his questions
presented, and we do not believe that the issue is fairly included within
them. We therefore decline review of this ruling by the Fifth Circuit.

Opinion of Thomas, J.
leged error is so uncertain, a defendant cannot meet his burden of showing that the error actually affected his substantial rights. Cf. Romano, 512 U. S., at 14. In Romano, we
considered a similar argument, namely, that jurors had disregarded a trial judge's instructions and given undue weight
to certain evidence. In rejecting that argument, we noted
that, even assuming that the jury disregarded the trial
judge's instructions, "[i]t seems equally plausible that the evidence could have made the jurors more inclined to impose a
death sentence, or it could have made them less inclined to
do so." Ibid. Any speculation on the effect of a lesser sentence recommendation, like the evidence in Romano, would
have had such an indeterminate effect on the outcome of the
proceeding that we cannot conclude that any alleged error in
the District Court's instructions affected petitioner's substantial rights. See Park, 421 U. S., at 676; Lopez, 373 U. S.,
at 436-437.

III

A

Apart from the claimed instructional error, petitioner argues that the nonstatutory aggravating factors found and
considered by the jury, see n. 2, supra, were vague, overbroad, and duplicative in violation of the Eighth Amendment,
and that the District Court's error in allowing the jury to
consider them was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.

The Eighth Amendment, as the Court of Appeals correctly
recognized, see 132 F. 3d, at 250, permits capital sentencing
juries to consider evidence relating to the victim's personal
characteristics and the emotional impact of the murder on
the victim's family in deciding whether an eligible defendant
should receive a death sentence. See Payne v. Tennessee,
501 U. S. 808, 827 (1991) ("A State may legitimately conclude
that evidence about the victim and about the impact of the
murder on the victim's family is relevant to the jury's decision as to whether or not the death penalty should be im527US1 Unit: $U80 [05-09-01 13:00:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of Thomas, J.
posed. There is no reason to treat such evidence differently
than other relevant evidence is treated"). Petitioner does
not dispute that, as a general matter, such evidence is appropriate for the sentencing jury's consideration. See Reply
Brief for Petitioner 15. His objection is that the two nonstatutory aggravating factors were duplicative, vague, and
overbroad so as to render their use in this case unconstitutional, a point with which the Fifth Circuit agreed, 132 F. 3d,
at 250-251, although it ultimately ruled in the Government's
favor on the ground that the alleged error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, id., at 251-252.

The Government here renews its argument that the nonstatutory aggravators in this case were constitutionally
valid. At oral argument, however, it was suggested that
this case comes to us on the assumption that the nonstatutory aggravating factors were invalid because the Government did not cross-appeal on the question. Tr. of Oral Arg.
25. As the prevailing party, the Government is entitled to
defend the judgment on any ground that it properly raised
below. See, e. g., El Paso Natural Gas Co. v. Neztsosie, 526
U. S. 473, 479 (1999); Northwest Airlines, Inc. v. County of
Kent, 510 U. S. 355, 364 (1994) ("A prevailing party need not
cross-petition to defend a judgment on any ground properly
raised below, so long as that party seeks to preserve, and
not to change, the judgment"). It further was suggested
that because we granted certiorari on the Government's rephrasing of petitioner's questions and because the third
question--"whether the court of appeals correctly held that
the submission of invalid nonstatutory aggravating factors
was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt"--presumes error,
we must assume the nonstatutory aggravating factors were
erroneous. Tr. of Oral Arg. 25-27. We are not convinced
that the reformulated question presumes error. The question whether the nonstatutory aggravating factors were constitutional is fairly included within the third question pre527US1 Unit: $U80 [05-09-01 13:00:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN

397Cite as: 527 U. S. 373 (1999)
Opinion of Thomas, J.
sented--we might answer "no" to the question "[w]hetherthe Court of Appeals correctly held that the submission of

invalid nonstatutory aggravating factors was harmless be-yond a reasonable doubt," 525 U. S. 809 (1998), by explaining
that the Fifth Circuit was incorrect in holding that there was
error. Without a doubt, the Government would have done
better to call our attention to the fact that it planned to
argue that the nonstatutory aggravating factors were valid
at the petitioning stage. But it did not affirmatively concede that the nonstatutory aggravators were invalid, see
Brief in Opposition 18-22, and absent such a concession,
we think that the Government's argument is properly
presented.12

12 The dissent would treat this aspect of the Government's argument as
waived. Post, at 420-421, n. 24. As Justice Ginsburg explained, for a
unanimous Court, in Caterpillar Inc. v. Lewis, 519 U. S. 61 (1996): "Under
this Court's Rule 15.2, a nonjurisdictional argument not raised in a respondent's brief in opposition to a petition for a writ of certiorari `may be
deemed waived.' " Id., at 75, n. 13 (emphasis added). But we have not
done so when the issue not raised in the brief in opposition was "predicate
to an intelligent resolution of the question presented." Ohio v. Robinette,
519 U. S. 33, 38 (1996) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Caterpillar, 519 U. S., at 75, n. 13. In those instances, we have treated the
issue not raised in opposition as fairly included within the question presented. This is certainly such a case. Assessing the error (including
whether there was error at all) is essential to an intelligent resolution of
whether any such error was harmless. Moreover, here, as in Caterpillar,
"[t]he parties addressed the issue in their briefs and at oral argument."
Ibid. By contrast, in the cases that the dissent looks to for support for
its position, there were good reasons to decline to exercise our discretion.
In Roberts v. Galen of Va., Inc., 525 U. S. 249, 253-254 (1999) (per curiam),
the "claims [we declined to consider did] not appear to have been sufficiently developed below for us to assess them," and in South Central Bell
Telephone Co. v. Alabama, 526 U. S. 160, 171 (1999), the argument respondent raised for the first time in its merits brief was "so far-reaching
an argument" that "[w]e would normally expect notice [of it]," especially
when, unlike this case, the respondent's argument did not appear to have
been raised or considered below.

398 JONES v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of Thomas, J.

1
We first address petitioner's contention that the two nonstatutory aggravating factors were impermissibly duplica-tive. The Fifth Circuit reasoned that "[t]he plain meaning

of the term `personal characteristics,' used in [nonstatutoryaggravator] 3(C), necessarily includes `young age, slight stature, background, and unfamiliarity,' which the jury wasasked to consider in 3(B)." 132 F. 3d, at 250. The problem,
the court thought, was that this duplication led to "double
counting" of aggravating factors. Following a Tenth Circuitdecision,

United States v. McCullah, 76 F. 3d 1087, 1111
(1996), the Fifth Circuit was of the view that in a weighingscheme, "double counting" has a tendency to skew the process so as to give rise to the risk of an arbitrary, and thusunconstitutional, death sentence. 132 F. 3d, at 251. In the
Fifth Circuit's words, there may be a thumb on the scale infavor of death "[i]f the jury has been asked to weigh the
same aggravating factor twice." Ibid.

We have never before held that aggravating factors couldbe duplicative so as to render them constitutionally invalid,

nor have we passed on the "double counting" theory that theTenth Circuit advanced in

McCullah 13 and the Fifth Circuitappears to have followed here. What we have said is that

the weighing process may be impermissibly skewed if the
sentencing jury considers an invalid factor. See Stringer v.
Black, 503 U. S. 222, 232 (1992). Petitioner's argument (and
the reasoning of the Fifth and Tenth Circuits) would have usreach a quite different proposition--that if two aggravating

factors are "duplicative," then the weighing process neces-sarily is skewed, and the factors are therefore invalid.

Even accepting, for the sake of argument, petitioner's"double counting" theory, there are nevertheless several

13 The Tenth Circuit, in a decision subsequent to McCullah, has emphasized that factors do not impermissibly overlap unless one "necessarily
subsumes" the other. Cooks v. Ward, 165 F. 3d 1283, 1289 (1998).

Opinion of Thomas, J.
problems with the Fifth Circuit's application of the theory inthis case. The phrase "personal characteristics" as used in

factor 3(C) does not obviously include the specific personalcharacteristics listed in 3(B)--"young age, her slight stature,
her background, and her unfamiliarity with San Angelo"--
especially in light of the fact that 3(C) went on to refer to theimpact of the crime on the victim's family. In the context of

considering the effect of the crime on the victim's family, itwould be more natural to understand "personal characteristics" to refer to those aspects of the victim's character andpersonality that her family would miss the most. More important, to the extent that there was any ambiguity arising
from how the factors were drafted, the Government's argument to the jury made clear that 3(B) and 3(C) went to entirely different areas of aggravation--the former clearly
went to victim vulnerability while the latter captured the
victim's individual uniqueness and the effect of the crime on
her family. See, e. g., 25 Record 2733-2734 ("[Y]ou can consider [the victim's] young age, her slight stature, her background, her unfamiliarity with the San Angelo area. . . . She
is barely five feet tall [and] weighs approximately 100
pounds. [She is] the ideal victim"); id., at 2734 ("[Y]ou can
consider [the victim's] personal characteristics and the effects of the instant offense on her family. . . . You heard about
this young woman, you heard about her from her mother,
you heard about her from her friends that knew her. She
was special, she was unique, she was loving, she was caring,
she had a lot to offer this world"). As such, even if the
phrase "personal characteristics" as used in factor 3(C) was
understood to include the specific personal characteristics
listed in 3(B), the factors as a whole were not duplicative--
at best, certain evidence was relevant to two different aggravating factors. Moreover, any risk that the weighing process would be skewed was eliminated by the District Court's
instruction that the jury "should not simply count the number of aggravating and mitigating factors and reach a deci527US1 Unit: $U80 [05-09-01 13:00:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN
400 JONES v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of Thomas, J.
sion based on which number is greater [but rather] shouldconsider the weight and value of each factor." App. 45.

2
We also are of the view that the Fifth Circuit incorrectlyconcluded that factors 3(B) and 3(C) were unconstitutionally

vague. In that court's view, the nonstatutory aggravatingfactors challenged here "fail[ed] to guide the jury's discretion, or [to] distinguish this murder from any other murder."132 F. 3d, at 251. The Court of Appeals, relying on our decision in Maynard v. Cartwright, 486 U. S. 356, 361-362 (1988),also was of the opinion that "[t]he use of the terms `background,' `personal characteristics,' and `unfamiliarity' with-out further definition or instruction left the jury with . . .
open-ended discretion." 132 F. 3d, at 251 (internal quota-tion marks omitted).

Ensuring that a sentence of death is not so infected withbias or caprice is our "controlling objective when we examine
eligibility and selection factors for vagueness." Tuilaepa v.California, 512 U. S. 967, 973 (1994). Our vagueness review, however, is "quite deferential." Ibid. As long as anaggravating factor has a core meaning that criminal juries
should be capable of understanding, it will pass consti-tutional muster.

Ibid. Assessed under this deferentialstandard, the factors challenged here surely are not vague.

The jury should have had no difficulty understanding thatfactor 3(B) was designed to ask it to consider whether the
victim was especially vulnerable to petitioner's attack. Norshould it have had difficulty comprehending that factor 3(C)
asked it to consider the victim's personal traits and the effectof the crime on her family.

14 Even if the factors as written

14 Petitioner argues that the term "personal characteristics" was so
vague that the jury may have thought it could consider the victim's race
and the petitioner's race under factor 3(C). In light of the remainder of
the factor and the Government's argument with respect to the factor, we
fail to see that possibility. In any event, in accordance with the Death

Opinion of Thomas, J.
were somewhat vague, the Fifth Circuit was wrong to con-clude that the factors were not given further definition, see

132 F. 3d, at 251; as we have explained, the Government'sargument made absolutely clear what each nonstatutory factor meant.15 3

Finally, we turn to petitioner's contention that the chal-lenged nonstatutory factors were overbroad. An aggravating factor can be overbroad if the sentencing jury "fairlycould conclude that an aggravating circumstance applies to
every defendant eligible for the death penalty." Arave v.
Creech, 507 U. S. 463, 474 (1993). We have not, however,specifically considered what it means for a factor to be overbroad when it is important only for selection purposes andespecially when it sets forth victim vulnerability or victim
impact evidence. Of course, every murder will have an im-pact on the victim's family and friends and victims are often
chosen because of their vulnerability. It might seem, then,that the factors 3(B) and 3(C) apply to every eligible defendant and thus fall within the Eighth Amendment's proscription against overbroad factors. But that cannot be correct;if it were, we would not have decided

Payne as we did.
Even though the concepts of victim impact and victim vul-nerability may well be relevant in every case,

evidence of
victim vulnerability and victim impact in a particular case isinherently individualized. And such evidence is surely relevant to the selection phase decision, given that the sentencer
Penalty Act's explicit command in $ 3593(f), the District Court instructed
the jury not to consider race at all in reaching its decision. App. 47. Jurors are presumed to have followed their instructions. See Richardson
v. Marsh, 481 U. S. 200, 206 (1987).

15 We reiterate the point we made in Tuilaepa v. California, 512 U. S.

967 (1994)--we have held only a few, quite similar factors vague, see, e. g.,
Maynard v. Cartwright, 486 U. S. 356 (1988) (whether murder was "especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel"), while upholding numerous other factors against vagueness challenges, see 512 U. S., at 974 (collecting cases).

527US1 Unit: $U80 [05-09-01 13:00:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN
402 JONES v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
should consider all of the circumstances of the crime in deciding whether to impose the death penalty. See Tuilaepa, 512
U. S., at 976.

What is of common importance at the eligibility and selection stages is that "the process is neutral and principled so
as to guard against bias or caprice in the sentencing decision." Id., at 973. So long as victim vulnerability and
victim impact factors are used to direct the jury to the individual circumstances of the case, we do not think that
principle will be disturbed. Because factors 3(B) and 3(C)
directed the jury to the evidence specific to this case, we do
not think that they were overbroad in a way that offended
the Constitution.

B

The error in this case, if any, rests in loose drafting of
the nonstatutory aggravating factors; as we have made clear,
victim vulnerability and victim impact evidence are appropriate subjects for the capital sentencer's consideration.
Assuming that use of these loosely drafted factors was indeed error, we conclude that the error was harmless.

Harmless-error review of a death sentence may be performed in at least two different ways. An appellate court
may choose to consider whether absent an invalid factor, the
jury would have reached the same verdict or it may choose
instead to consider whether the result would have been the
same had the invalid aggravating factor been precisely defined. See Clemons v. Mississippi, 494 U. S. 738, 753-754
(1990). The Fifth Circuit chose to perform the first sort of
analysis, and ultimately concluded that the jury would have
returned a recommendation of death even had it not considered the two supposedly invalid nonstatutory aggravating
factors:

"After removing the offensive non-statutory aggravating factors from the balance, we are left with two

Opinion of the Court
statutory aggravating factors and eleven mitigating fac-tors to consider when deciding whether, beyond a reasonable doubt, the death sentence would have been im-posed had the invalid aggravating factors never been
submitted to the jury. At the sentencing hearing, thegovernment placed great emphasis on the two statutory
aggravating factors found unanimously by the jury--Jones caused the death of the victim during the commission of the offense of kidnapping; and the offense wascommitted in an especially heinous, cruel, and depraved
manner in that it involved torture or serious physicalabuse of the victim. Under part two of the Special
Findings Form, if the jury had failed to find that thegovernment proved at least one of the statutory aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt, then the delib-erations would have ceased leaving the jury powerless
to recommend the death penalty. Therefore, the abilityof the jury to recommend the death penalty hinged on
a finding of a least one statutory aggravating factor.Conversely, jury findings regarding the non-statutory
aggravating factors were not required before the jurycould recommend the death penalty. After removing
the two non-statutory aggravating factors from the mix,we conclude that the two remaining statutory aggravating factors unanimously found by the jury support thesentence of death, even after considering the eleven mitigating factors found by one or more jurors. Conse-quently, the error was harmless because the death sentence would have been imposed beyond a reasonabledoubt had the invalid aggravating factors never been
submitted to the jury." 132 F. 3d, at 252.
Petitioner claims that the court's analysis was so perfunctoryas to be infirm. His argument is largely based on the following passage from Clemons: "Under these circumstances, itwould require a detailed explanation based on the record for

527US1 Unit: $U80 [05-09-01 13:00:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN
404 JONES v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
us possibly to agree that the error in giving the invalid `especially heinous' instruction was harmless." 494 U. S., at 753-
754 (emphasis added). Clemons, however, involved quite
different facts. There, an "especially heinous" aggravating
factor was determined to be unconstitutionally vague. The
only remaining aggravating factor was that the murder was
committed during a robbery for pecuniary gain. The State
had repeatedly emphasized the invalid factor and said little
about the valid aggravator. See id., at 753. Despite this,
all that the Mississippi Supreme Court said was: " `We likewise are of the opinion beyond a reasonable doubt that the
jury's verdict would have been the same with or without
the "especially heinous, atrocious or cruel" aggravating circumstance.' " Ibid. (quoting Clemons v. State, 535 So. 2d
1354, 1364 (Miss. 1988)). We quite understandably required
a "detailed explanation based on the record" in those
circumstances.

The same "detailed explanation . . . on the record" that we
required in Clemons may not have been necessary in this
case. Cf. Sochor v. Florida, 504 U. S. 527, 540 (1992) (there
is no federal requirement that state courts adopt "a particular formulaic indication" before their review for harmless
error will pass scrutiny). But even if the Fifth Circuit's
harmless-error analysis was too perfunctory, we think it
plain, under the alternative mode of harmless-error analysis,
that the error indeed was harmless beyond a reasonable
doubt. See $ 3595(c)(2) (federal death sentences are not to
be set aside on the basis of errors that are harmless beyond a
reasonable doubt). Had factors 3(B) and 3(C) been precisely
defined in writing, the jury surely would have reached the
same recommendation as it did. The Government's argument to the jury, see, e. g., 25 Record 2733-2734, cured the
nonstatutory factors of any infirmity as written. We are
satisfied that the jury in this case actually understood what
each factor was designed to put before it, and therefore have

no doubt that the jury would have reached the same conclu-sion had the aggravators been precisely defined in writing.

Appeals is affirmed.

It is so ordered.

Justice Ginsburg, with whom Justice Stevens and
Justice Souter join, and with whom Justice Breyer joinsas to Parts I, II, III, and V, dissenting.

The Federal Death Penalty Act of 1994 (FDPA), 18 U. S. C.$$ 3591-3598 (1994 ed. and Supp. III), establishes a complex
regime applicable when the Government seeks the ultimatepenalty for a defendant found guilty of an offense potentially
punishable by death. This case is pathmarking, for it is the
first application of the FDPA. Two questions, as I compre-hend petitioner's core objections, warrant prime attention.

First, when Congress specifies only two sentencing options
for an offense, death or life without possibility of release,
must the jury be told exactly that? Or, can a death decision
stand despite misleading trial court "lesser sentence" instructions, specifically, instructions open to the construction
that lack of a unanimous jury vote for either life or death
would allow the judge to impose a sentence less severe than
life in prison? Second, when the jury is unable to agree on
a unanimous recommendation in a case in which death or life
without possibility of release are the only sentencing options,
must the judge then impose the life sentence? Or, is the
judge required or permitted to impanel a second jury to
make the life or death decision?

The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit confronted
these two questions and resolved both for the prosecution.
The Fifth Circuit also tolerated the trial court's submission
of two nonstatutory aggravating factors to the jury, although

527US1 Unit: $U80 [05-09-01 13:00:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN
406 JONES v. UNITED STATES

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
the appeals court found those factors duplicative and vague.1The lower courts' disposition for death, despite the flawed

trial proceedings, and this Court's tolerance of the flaws, dis-regard a most basic guide: "[A]ccurate sentencing information is an indispensable prerequisite to a [ jury's] determi-nation of whether a defendant shall live or die."

Gregg v.Georgia, 428 U. S. 153, 190 (1976) ( joint opinion of Stewart,

Powell, and Stevens, JJ.). That "indispensable prerequi-site" was not satisfied in this case. I would reverse and remand so that the life or death decision may be made by anaccurately informed trier.

I
After authorizing the federal death penalty for a small cat-egory of cases in 1988,

2 Congress enacted comprehensive

death penalty legislation in 1994. See FDPA, 108 Stat.

1 The Court granted certiorari on three questions as phrased by the
United States:
" `1. Whether petitioner was entitled to a jury instruction that the jury's
failure to agree on a sentencing recommendation automatically would result in a court-imposed sentence of life imprisonment without possibility
of release. 2. Whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury instructions led the jury to believe that deadlock on the penalty recommendation would automatically result in a court-imposed sentence less severe
than life imprisonment. 3. Whether the Court of Appeals correctly held
that the submission of invalid nonstatutory aggravating factors was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.' " 525 U. S. 809 (1998); see also Brief for
United States I.

I think it fair and " `principled,' " ante, at 402, to read the indigent petitioner's arguments on the questions presented with the willingness to

penalty for murder resulting from certain drug-related offenses. See

procedures; principally, it provides for a separate sentencing
hearing whenever the Government seeks the death penalty
for defendants found guilty of a covered offense. See 18
U. S. C. $ 3593.5

In death-eligible homicide cases, the Act instructs, the
jury must respond sequentially to three inquiries; imposition
of the death penalty requires unanimity on each of the three.
First, the jury determines whether there was a killing or
death resulting from the defendant's intentional engagement
in life-threatening activity. See 18 U. S. C. $ 3591(a)(2).6

3 Congress enacted three statutes authorizing the death penalty between 1972 and 1988: Antihijacking Act of 1974, $ 105, 88 Stat. 411-413,
repealed by FDPA, $ 6002, 108 Stat. 1970 (air piracy); Criminal Law and
Procedure Technical Amendments Act of 1986, $ 61, 100 Stat. 3614 (witness
killing); Department of Defense Authorization Act, 1986, $ 534, 99 Stat.
634-635 (amending the Uniform Military Justice Act to establish weighing
procedures for courts-martial considering the death penalty for espionage). Earlier federal statutes authorizing the death penalty remained
on the books, but were not invoked following this Court's decision in Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238 (1972) (per curiam), which led to a hiatus
in death penalty adjudications. See Little, The Federal Death Penalty:
History and Some Thoughts About the Department of Justice's Role, 26
Ford. Urb. L. J. 347, 349, n. 5, 372-380 (1999).

4 See id., at 391, and n. 242 (estimating that the FDPA applies to at least

44 offenses).

5 The sentencing hearing is before a jury unless the defendant, with the

approval of the Government, moves for a hearing before the court. See
18 U. S. C. $ 3593(b).

6 Section 3591(a)(2) allows the death penalty for a defendant found guilty

of a death-eligible homicide "if the defendant, as determined beyond a
reasonable doubt at the [sentencing] hearing":

"(B) intentionally inflicted serious bodily injury that resulted in the
death of the victim;

Second, the jury decides which, if any, of the Government-proposed aggravating factors, statutory and nonstatutory,

were proved beyond a reasonable doubt. See $ 3593(d).7Third, if the jury finds at least one of the statutory aggravators proposed by the Government, the jury then determineswhether the aggravating factors "sufficiently outweigh" the
mitigating factors to warrant a death sentence, or, absentmitigating factors, whether the aggravators alone warrant
that sentence. $ 3593(e). The mitigating factors, sevenstatutory and any others tending against the death sentence,
are individually determined by each juror; unlike aggravat-ing factors, on which the jury must unanimously agree under
a "beyond a reasonable doubt" standard, a mitigating factormay be considered in the jury's weighing process if any one

juror finds the factor proved by a "preponderance of the evi-dence." See $$ 3592(a), (c), 3593(d). The weighing is not
numeric; the perceived significance, not the number, of ag-gravating and mitigating factors determines the decision.

Jones moved for a new trial on the ground, supported bypostsentence juror statements, that the court's instructions
had misled the jurors. Specifically, Jones urged that thecharge led jurors to believe that a deadlock would result in
a court-imposed lesser sentence; to avoid such an outcome,Jones asserted, jurors who favored life without possibility of
release changed their votes to approve the death verdict.See App. 60-68, 75-80. The vote change, Jones maintained,
was not hypothetical; it was backed up by juror statements.

jury, in fact, was so misled when it sentenced him to death.See

id., at 245-246 (although Federal Rule of Evidence 606(b)
is not applicable to FDPA penalty-phase proceedings, see 18
U. S. C. $ 3593(c), "[t]he reasons for not allowing jurors to un-dermine verdicts in [trial proceedings] . . . apply with equal

force to sentencing hearings").Nor, in the Court of Appeals' view, did the District Court
err plainly by conveying to the jury the misinformation thatthree sentencing options were available--death, life imprisonment without release, or some other lesser sentence. See
132 F. 3d, at 246-248. Noting that the FDPA takes account
of all three possibilities, see 18 U. S. C. $ 3593(e), while the
kidnaping statute authorizes only two sentences, death or
life imprisonment, see $ 1201(a), the Fifth Circuit acknowledged that the District Court had erred in giving the jury a
lesser sentence option: "[T]he substantive [kidnaping] statute takes precedence over the death penalty sentencing provisions" and limits the options to death or life imprisonment
without release. 132 F. 3d, at 248. The appeals court nevertheless concluded that the District Court's error was not
"plain" because the FDPA was new and no prior opinion had
addressed the question; hence, no "clearly established law"
was in place at the time of Jones's sentencing hearing. Ibid.

The Fifth Circuit also considered Jones's challenge to the
nonstatutory aggravators presented to the jury at the Government's request. The court held that the two found by
the jury--the victim's "young age, her slight stature, her
background, and her unfamiliarity with San Angelo, Texas,"
and her "personal characteristics and the effect of the . . .
offense on [her] family"--were "duplicative" of each other,
and also impermissibly "vague and overbroad." Id., at 250-

The governing law gave Jones's jury at the sentencing
phase a life (without release) or death choice. The District
Court, however, introduced, erroneously, a third prospect,
"some other lesser sentence." App. 44.13 Moreover, the
court told the jury "not to be concerned" with what that
lesser sentence might be, for "[t]hat [was] a matter for the
court to decide." Ibid. The jury's choice was clouded by
that misinformation. I set out below my reasons for concluding that the misinformation rendered the jury's death
verdict unreliable.

A

The District Court instructed the jury:

"[Y]ou the jury, by unanimous vote, shall recommend
whether the defendant should be sentenced to death,
sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of
release, or sentenced to some other lesser sentence.. . . . .

". . . If you recommend that some other lesser sentence be imposed, the court is required to impose a sentence that is authorized by the law. In deciding what
recommendation to make, you are not to be concerned
with the question of what sentence the defendant might
receive in the event you determine not to recommend
a death sentence or a sentence of life without the possibility of release. That is a matter for the court to decide in the event you conclude that a sentence of death

13 The problem was not, as the Court describes it, a failure to give the
jury "[a] bit of information that might possibly influence an individual
juror's voting behavior," ante, at 382; rather, the jury was " `affirmatively
misled,' " cf. ante, at 381, by the repeated misinformation the charge and
decision forms conveyed.

or life without the possibility of release should not berecommended.

. . . . .
"In order to bring back a verdict recommending thepunishment of death or life without the possibility of

release, all twelve of you must unanimously vote in favorof such specific penalty." App. 43-45.

Those instructions misinformed the jury in two intertwinedrespects: First, they wrongly identified a "lesser sentence"
option; 14 second, the instructions were open to the readingthat, absent juror unanimity on death or life without release,
the District Court could impose a lesser sentence.The Fifth Circuit, and the United States in its submission
to this Court, acknowledged the charge error. See 132F. 3d, at 248; ante, at 387, n. 8. Section 1201, which defines
the crime, governs. It calls for death or life imprisonment,nothing less, and neither parole nor good-time credits could
reduce the life sentence. See Brief for United States 13-14,n. 2 ("[W]e agree with petitioner that the only sentences that
could have been imposed are death and life without release(because the kidnapping statute, 18 U. S. C. [$ ]1201, authorizes only death and life imprisonment, and neither parole norgood-time credits could reduce the life sentence)."). The
third option listed in the FDPA provision, "some other lessersentence," $ 3593(e), is available only when the substantive
statute does not confine the sentence to life or death. TheFifth Circuit found the error "not so obvious, clear, readily
apparent, or conspicuous." 132 F. 3d, at 248. I disagree

14 The verdict forms compounded the error by allowing the jurors to
return as their decision the statement: "We the jury recommend some
other lesser sentence." App. 59.

Jones does not press the District Court's identification of a lesser sentence option as an independent ground for reversal. That error, however,
is an essential component of his argument that the misinformation conveyed by the District Court led the jury to believe that deadlock could
result in a less-than-life sentence.

The flawed charge did not simply include a nonexistentoption. It could have been understood to convey that, absent juror unanimity, some "lesser sentence" might be im-posed by the court. That message came from instructions
that the jury must be unanimous to "bring back a verdictrecommending the punishment of death or life without the
possibility of release," App. 45, that "some other lesser sen-tence" was possible,

id., at 44, and that the jury should not"be concerned with the . . . sentence the defendant might

receive in the event [it] determine[d] not to recommenda death sentence or a sentence of life without the possibility
of release," ibid. Jones's proposed instructions--that he

15 Justice Breyer does not believe that the District Court's submission
of the (unobjected-to) jury instructions amounted to "plain error." In his
view, the judge's (objected-to) failure to submit the defense's proposed
instruction no. 5 amounted to an "abuse of discretion," for that proposed
instruction was legally correct, the judge's failure to give it likely rested
upon an erroneous view of the law, and it would have corrected the false
impression created by the remaining instructions. See Cooter & Gell v.
Hartmarx Corp., 496 U. S. 384, 405 (1990); App. 74 (order denying defendant's motion for new trial); cf. 132 F. 3d, at 242.

16 The Fifth Circuit noted that Jones's counsel proposed language referring to a "lesser sentence," but reviewed for "plain error," rather than
discounting the error as "invited," because the District Court did not use
defense counsel's requested language. 132 F. 3d, at 246, n. 10. Although
Jones's counsel did propose "lesser sentence" language, see, e. g., App. 26,
Jones's proposed instructions nos. 4 and 5 made one thing clear--his view
that the jury and judge were required to impose life without possibility of
release if the jury did not agree to death. See supra, at 409-410, nn. 9, 10.

17 The Court, in a footnote, appears to recognize what should be beyond

genuine debate: For Jones, "the only possible sentences were death and a
life sentence." Ante, at 387, n. 8. In face of the District Court's lesser
sentence instructions, four times given to the jury, it is difficult to comprehend why this Court "cannot see that any error occurred." See ante,
at 390.

18

There is, at least, a reasonable likelihood that the flawedcharge tainted the jury deliberations. See

Boyde v. California, 494 U. S. 370, 380 (1990) (where "[t]he claim is that the
instruction is . . . subject to an erroneous interpretation,"the "proper inquiry . . . is whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury has applied the challenged instruction"erroneously). As recently noted, a jury may be swayed toward death if it believes the defendant otherwise may serveless than life in prison. See

Simmons v. South Carolina,
512 U. S. 154, 163 (1994) (plurality opinion) ("[I]t is entirelyreasonable for a sentencing jury to view a defendant who is

eligible for parole as a greater threat to society than a defendant who is not."). Jurors may have been persuaded to
switch from life to death to ward off what no juror wanted,
i. e., any chance of a lesser sentence by the judge.19

18 It is the general rule, as the Government observes, and the Court
repeats, that " `[a] party who has requested an instruction that has not
been given is not relieved of the requirement that he state distinctly his
objection to the instruction that is given.' " Brief for United States 24
(quoting 2 C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure $ 484, p. 702 (2d ed.
1982)); see also ante, at 388. It is also true, however, that "the requirement of objections should not be employed woodenly, but should be applied
where its application will serve the ends for which it was designed, rather
than being made into a trap for the unwary." 2 Wright, supra, $ 484, at
699-701. Here, Jones's proposed instruction that his default sentence was
life without possibility of release apprised the District Court and the Government of his essential position.

19 While precedent supports the Fifth Circuit's affirmation that statements attesting to the juror's understanding of the instructions are inadmissible, see 132 F. 3d, at 245-246, the statements Jones submitted
do assert that apprehension of a lesser sentence the judge might impose
in fact caused jurors to vote for a death sentence, see App. 68, 79. On
a matter so grave, I would not discount those statements altogether.

The Court, in common with the Fifth Circuit and the Solic-itor General, insists it was just as likely that jurors not supporting death could have persuaded death-prone jurors togive way and vote for a life sentence. See ante, at 394; 132
F. 3d, at 246; Brief for United States 22. I would demur(say so what) to that position. It should suffice that the potential to confuse existed, i. e., that the instructions couldhave tilted the jury toward death. The instructions "introduce[d] a level of uncertainty and unreliability into the fact-finding process that cannot be tolerated in a capital case."
Beck v. Alabama, 447 U. S. 625, 643 (1980). "Capital sen-tencing should not be . . . a game of `chicken,' in which life
or death turns on the . . . happenstance of whether the partic-ular `life' jurors or `death' jurors in each case will be the first
to give in, in order to avoid a perceived third sentencingoutcome unacceptable to either set of jurors." Reply Brief
7-8, n. 11. B

The Fifth Circuit held that the District Court was notobliged to tell the jury that Jones's default penalty was life
without possibility of release in part because the appealscourt viewed that instruction as "substantively [in]correct."
132 F. 3d, at 242.20 As the Fifth Circuit comprehended thelaw, if the jury deadlocked, "a second sentencing hearing

(L. Hand, J.) (while many defects in jury deliberation do not require reversal, "this has . . . nothing to do with what evidence shall be competent
to prove the facts when the facts do require the verdict to be set aside, as
concededly some facts do").

20 Misinformation, not the District Court's failure to repeat the unanimity requirement each time it mentioned the jury's sentencing options, or
to advise on the consequences of a deadlocked jury, is the harmful error
at the heart of Jones's case. I therefore see no cause to dispute that "the
Eighth Amendment does not require that the jury be instructed as to the
consequences of their failure to agree." Ante, at 381. In my judgment,
however, the court was obliged, in this life or death case, to make clear
to the jury that Jones's minimum sentence was life without possibility
of release.

would have to be held in front of a second jury impaneled forthat purpose." Id., at 243.

21 But the FDPA, it seems to

me clear, does not provide for a second shot at death. Thedispositive provision, as I read the Act, is $ 3594, which first

states that the court shall sentence the defendant to deathor life imprisonment without possibility of release if the jury
so recommends, and then continues:

"Otherwise, the court shall impose any lesser sentencethat is authorized by law. Notwithstanding any other

law, if the maximum term of imprisonment for theoffense is life imprisonment, the court may impose a
sentence of life imprisonment without possibility ofrelease." 18 U. S. C. $ 3594.

The "[o]therwise" clause, requiring judge sentencing,becomes operative when a jury fails to make a unanimous
recommendation at the close of deliberations. The FifthCircuit's attention was deflected from the $ 3594 path by

$ 3593(b)(2)(C), which provides for a sentencing hearing "be-fore a jury impaneled for the purpose of the hearing if . . .
the jury that determined the defendant's guilt was dis-charged for good cause." Discharge for "good cause" under

$ 3593(b)(2)(C), however, is most reasonably read to coverguilt-phase (and, by extension, penalty-phase) juror disqualification due to, e. g., exposure to prejudicial extrinsic infor-mation or illness. The provision should not be read expansively to encompass failure to reach a unanimous life ordeath decision.

The Government refers to a "background rule" allowingretrial if the jury is unable to reach a verdict, and urges that

21 At oral argument, counsel for the United States maintained that it
would be up to the prosecutor, when a jury is deadlocked, to request a
new panel or to allow the judge to decide on the sentence. See Tr. of

to impose the sentence. See id., at 46.

the FDPA should be read in light of that rule. Brief for
United States 29. But retrial is not the prevailing rule for
capital penalty-phase proceedings. As the Government's
own survey of state laws shows, in life or death cases, most
States require judge sentencing once a jury has deadlocked.
See id., at 32; App. to Brief for United States 1a-6a (identifying 25 States in which the court imposes sentence upon deadlock and three States in which a new sentencing hearing is
possible); see also Acker & Lanier, Law, Discretion, and the
Capital Jury: Death Penalty Statutes and Proposals for Reform, 32 Crim. L. Bull. 134, 169 (1996) ("In twenty-five of the
twenty-nine states in which capital juries have final sentencing authority, . . . a deadlocked sentencing jury is transformed into a `lifelocked' jury. That is, the jury's inability
to produce a unanimous penalty-phase verdict results in the
defendant's being sentenced to life imprisonment or life imprisonment without parole." (footnotes omitted)).

Furthermore, at the time Congress adopted the FDPA,
identical language in the predecessor Anti-Drug Abuse and
Death Penalty Act of 1988 had been construed to mandate
court sentencing upon jury deadlock. See United States v.
Chandler, 996 F. 2d 1073, 1086 (CA11 1993) ("If the jury does
not [recommend death], the district court sentences the defendant."); United States v. Pitera, 795 F. Supp. 546, 552
(EDNY 1992) ("Absent a recommendation of death, the court
must sentence a defendant.").22 The House Report suggests
that Congress understood and approved that construction.
See H. R. Rep. No. 103-467, p. 9 (1994) ("If the jury is not

the death sentence upon jury recommendation, that "[o]therwise the
court shall impose a sentence, other than death, authorized by law,"

$ 848(l). Under the Anti-Drug Abuse Act, unlike the FDPA, the only
binding recommendation the jury can make is for death.

Piled on the key instructional error, the trial court pre-sented the jury with duplicative, vague nonstatutory aggravating factors. The court told the jury to consider as aggra-vators, if established beyond a reasonable doubt, factors
3(B)--the victim's "young age, her slight stature, her back-ground, and her unfamiliarity with San Angelo, Texas"--and
3(C)--the victim's "personal characteristics and the effect ofthe instant offense on [her] family." 132 F. 3d, at 250.

23

The jury found both. See ibid.The District Court did not clarify the meaning of the

terms "background" and "personal characteristics." See id.,at 251. Notably, the term "personal characteristics" in aggravator 3(C) necessarily included "young age," "slight stat-ure," "background," and "unfamiliarity," factors the jury was
told to consider in aggravator 3(B). I would not attributeto the Court genuine disagreement with that proposition.
But see ante, at 399. Double counting of aggravators "cre-ates the risk of an arbitrary death sentence." 132 F. 3d, at
251; see also United States v. McCullah, 76 F. 3d 1087, 1111(CA10 1996) ("Such double counting of aggravating factors,
especially under a weighing scheme, has a tendency to skewthe weighing process and creates the risk that the death sentence will be imposed arbitrarily."). The Fifth Circuit con-sidered the District Court's lapse inconsequential, concluding
that "the two remaining statutory aggravating factors . . .support the sentence of death, even after considering the
eleven mitigating factors." 132 F. 3d, at 252.24

23 Counsel specifically objected to these factors. See App. 21-22, 28.
24 The Government now argues, contrary to the Fifth Circuit's conclusion, that aggravating factors 3(B) and 3(C) are not duplicative, vague,
or overbroad. See Brief for United States 40-45. The Court granted
certiorari on the Government's reformulated questions, which presumed
the incorrectness of the aggravators. See supra, at 406, n. 1. In its brief

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
Appellate courts should hesitate to assert confidence that"elimination of improperly considered aggravating circumstances could not possibly affect the balance." Barclay v.Florida, 463 U. S. 939, 958 (1983). Adding the overlapping
aggravators to the more disturbing misinformation conveyedin the charge, I see no basis for concluding " `it would have
made no difference if the thumb had been removed fromdeath's side of the scale.' " 132 F. 3d, at 251 (quoting
Stringer v. Black, 503 U. S. 222, 232 (1992)).

V
The Fifth Circuit's tolerance of error in this case, and thisCourt's refusal to face up to it, cannot be reconciled with the

recognition in Woodson v. North Carolina, 428 U. S. 280, 305(1976) (plurality opinion), that "death is qualitatively different." If the jury's weighing process is infected by the trialcourt's misperceptions of the law, the legitimacy of an ensuin opposition, the Government did not challenge the Fifth Circuit's determination of error, but focused solely on whether the error was harmless.
Justice Thomas, writing for a plurality, nevertheless addresses the Government's newly raised argument. See ante, at 395-402. I would hold
the Government to a tighter rein and dismiss the tardy argument as
waived. See Roberts v. Galen of Va., Inc., 525 U. S. 249, 253 (1999) (per
curiam); South Central Bell Telephone Co. v. Alabama, 526 U. S. 160
(1999); cf. this Court's Rule 15.2.

It is evident that the issue held back by the Government was not "predicate to an intelligent resolution of the question presented." Ohio v. Robinette, 519 U. S. 33, 38 (1996) (internal quotation marks omitted). But see
ante, at 397, n. 12. Justice Thomas treats the two issues as separate and
independent. He maintains first that there was no error. Writing for the
Court, he then proceeds to assume there was error and concludes that any
error was harmless. Either holding would do to support the Court's disposition. See, e. g., United States v. Hasting, 461 U. S. 499, 506, n. 4, 510-512
(1983) (holding presumed error harmless rather than deciding whether
there was, in fact, error; Court explains "[t]he question on which review
was granted assumed that there was error and the question to be resolved
was whether harmless-error analysis should have applied"); id., at 512-513
(Stevens, J., concurring) (Court should decide case on the ground that there
was no error, without reaching harmless-error question).

JEFFERSON COUNTY, ALABAMA v. ACKER, SENIOR

JUDGE, UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT,

NORTHERN DISTRICT OF

ALABAMA, et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eleventh circuit

No. 98-10. Argued March 29, 1999--Decided June 21, 1999
Alabama has not authorized its counties to levy an income tax, but it

has authorized them to impose a "license or privilege tax" upon persons
who are not otherwise required to pay a license fee under state law.
Pursuant to this authorization, Jefferson County enacted Ordinance
No. 1120 (Ordinance), which imposes such an occupational tax. The
Ordinance declares it "unlawful . . . to engage in" a covered occupation without paying the tax; includes among those subject to the tax,
federal, state, and county officeholders; measures the fee as a percentage of the taxpayer's "gross receipts"; and defines "gross receipts" as,
inter alia, "compensation." Respondents, two United States District
Judges who maintain their principal offices in Jefferson County, resist
payment of the tax on the ground that it violates the intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine. The county instituted collection suits
in Alabama small claims court against the judges, who removed the
suits to the Federal District Court under the federal officer removal
statute, 28 U. S. C. $ 1442. The federal court denied the county's motions to remand and granted summary judgment for respondents, holding the county tax unconstitutional under the intergovernmental tax
immunity doctrine to the extent that it reached federal judges' compensation. The en banc Eleventh Circuit affirmed. This Court granted
certiorari and remanded for further consideration of whether the Tax
Injunction Act, $ 1341, deprived the District Court of jurisdiction to
adjudicate the matter. On remand, the Eleventh Circuit adhered to its
prior en banc decision.

Held:

1. The case was properly removed under the federal officer removal
statute. That provision permits a federal-court officer to remove to
federal district court any state-court civil action commenced against the
officer "for any act under color of office." 28 U. S. C. $ 1442(a)(3). To
qualify for removal, the officer must both raise a colorable federal defense, see Mesa v. California, 489 U. S. 121, 139, and establish that the

527US1 Unit: $U81 [05-02-01 19:09:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN
424 JEFFERSON COUNTY v. ACKER

Syllabus
suit is "for a[n] act under color of office," 28 U. S. C. $ 1442(a)(3) (emphasis added). Here, the judges argued, and the Eleventh Circuit held,
that the county tax falls on the performance of federal judicial duties
in the county and risks interfering with the Federal Judiciary's operation in violation of the intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine. That
argument, although the Court ultimately rejects it, presents a colorable
federal defense. To establish that the suit is "for" an act under color
of office, the court officer must show a nexus, a "causal connection" between the charged conduct and asserted official authority. Willingham
v. Morgan, 395 U. S. 402, 409. The judges' colorable federal defense
rests on a statement in the Ordinance declaring it "unlawful" for them
to "engage in [their] occupation" without paying the tax. Correspondingly, the judges see the county's enforcement actions as suits "for" their
having "engage[d] in [their] occupation." The Court credits the judges'
theory of the case for purposes of the jurisdictional inquiry and concludes that they have made an adequate threshold showing that the suit
is "for a[n] act under color of office." Pp. 430-433.

2. The Tax Injunction Act does not bar federal-court adjudication of
this case. That Act prohibits federal district courts from "enjoin[ing],
suspend[ing] or restrain[ing]" the imposition or collection of any state
tax where a plain, speedy, and efficient remedy may be had in the State's
courts. 28 U. S. C. $ 1341. By its terms, the Act bars anticipatory relief. Recognizing that there is little practical difference between an
injunction and anticipatory relief in the form of a declaratory judgment, the Court has held that declaratory relief falls within the Act's
compass. California v. Grace Brethren Church, 457 U. S. 393, 408.
But a suit to collect a tax is surely not brought to restrain state action,
and therefore does not fit the Act's description of suits barred from
federal district court adjudication. The Act was modeled on state and
federal provisions prohibiting anticipatory actions by taxpayers to stop
the initiation of collection proceedings. See, e. g., 26 U. S. C. $ 7421(a).
These provisions were not designed to prevent taxpayers from defending government collection suits. Pp. 433-435.

3. Jefferson County's tax operates as a nondiscriminatory tax on
the judges' compensation, to which the Public Salary Tax Act of

1939, 4 U. S. C. $ 111, consents when it allows States to tax the pay federal employees receive "if the taxation does not discriminate against
[that] employee because of the source of the pay or compensation."
Pp. 435-443.

(a) The Eleventh Circuit's holding that the tax violates the intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine as applied to federal judges extends that doctrine beyond the tight limits this Court has set. Until
1938, the doctrine was expansively applied to prohibit Federal and State

Syllabus
Governments from taxing the salaries of another sovereign's employees.
See, e. g., Dobbins v. Commissioners of Erie Cty., 16 Pet. 435, 450. In
Graves v. New York ex rel. O'Keefe, 306 U. S. 466, 486-487, the Court
expressly overruled prior decisions and held that a State's taxation of
federal employees' salaries lays no unconstitutional burden upon the
Federal Government. Since Graves, the Court has reaffirmed a narrow
approach to governmental tax immunity, United States v. New Mexico,
455 U. S. 720, 735, closely confining the doctrine to bar only those taxes
that are imposed directly on one sovereign by the other or that discriminate against a sovereign or those with whom it deals, Davis v.

Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489 U. S. 803, 811. In contracting the
doctrine, the Court has recognized that the area is one over which
Congress is the principal superintendent. See New Mexico, 455 U. S.,
at 737-738. Indeed, congressional action coincided with the Graves
turnaround: The Public Salary Tax Act was enacted shortly after release of the Court's decision in Graves. In Howard v. Commissioners
of Sinking Fund of Louisville, 344 U. S. 624, 625, n. 2, 629, the Court
concluded that a "license fee" similar in relevant respects to Jefferson
County's was an "income tax" for purposes of a federal statute authorizing state taxation of federal employees' incomes, even though the fee
was styled as a tax upon the privilege of working in a municipality, was
not an "income tax" under state law, and deviated from textbook income
tax characteristics. Id., at 628-629. As Howard indicates, whether
Jefferson County's license tax fits within the Public Salary Tax Act's
allowance of nondiscriminatory state taxation of federal employees' pay
is a question of federal law. The practical impact, not the State's name
tag, determines the answer to that question. Pp. 436-439.

(b) The Court rejects the judges' contention that two features of
the Ordinance remove the tax from the Public Salary Tax Act shelter
and render it an unconstitutional licensing scheme. The Court finds
unpersuasive the judges' first argument that the Ordinance, by declaring it "unlawful . . . to engage in" a covered occupation, falls under

Johnson v. Maryland, 254 U. S. 51, 57, which held that a State could
not require a federal postal employee to obtain a state driver's license
before performing his federal duties. The incautious "unlawful . . .
to engage in" words likely were written with nonfederal employees, the
vast majority of the occupational taxpayers, in front view. The Ordinance's actual operation is the decisive factor. See Detroit v. Murray
Corp. of America, 355 U. S. 489, 492. In practice, the county's license
tax serves a revenue-raising, not a regulatory, purpose. The county
neither issues licenses to taxpayers, nor in any way regulates them
in the performance of their duties based on their status as license taxpayers. Cf., e. g., Johnson, 254 U. S., at 57. In response to the judges'

527US1 Unit: $U81 [05-02-01 19:09:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Syllabus
refusal to pay the tax, the county simply instituted collection suits. Alabama has not endeavored to make it unlawful to carry out the duties of
a federal office without local permission. Also unavailing is the judges'
argument that the Ordinance's exemption for those holding another
state or county license reveals its true character as a licensing scheme,
not an income tax. The dispositive measure is the Public Salary Tax
Act, which does not require the state tax to be a typical "income tax,"
but consents to any tax on "pay or compensation," which Jefferson
County's surely is. Cf. Howard, 344 U. S., at 629. Pp. 439-442.

(c) The Public Salary Tax Act's sole caveat is that the tax must
"not discriminate . . . because of the [federal] source of the pay or compensation." 4 U. S. C. $ 111. In Davis, the Court held the nondiscrimination requirement violated by a state tax exempting retirement benefits paid by the State but not those paid by the Federal Government.
See 489 U. S., at 817-818. Jefferson County's tax, by contrast, does not
discriminate against federal judges in particular, or federal officeholders
in general, based on the federal source of their pay or compensation.
The tax is paid by all state judges in Jefferson County. This Court
rejects respondents' contention that, as federal judges can never fit
within the county's exemption for those who hold licenses under other
state or county laws, that exemption unlawfully disfavors them. The
record shows no discrimination between similarly situated federal and
state employees. Cf. id., at 814. There is no sound reason to deny
Alabama counties the right to tax with an even hand the compensation
of federal, state, and local officeholders whose services are rendered
within the county. See United States v. County of Fresno, 429 U. S.
452, 462. Pp. 442-443.

Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court.#
Jefferson County, Alabama, imposes an occupational tax on
persons working within the county who are not otherwise
required to pay a license fee under state law. The controversy before us stems from proceedings the county commenced to collect the tax from two federal judges who hold
court in the county. Preliminarily, the parties dispute
whether, as the federal judges assert, the collection proceedings may be removed to, and adjudicated in, federal court.
On the merits, the judges maintain that they are shielded
from payment of the tax by the intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine, while the county urges that the doctrine
does not apply unless the tax discriminates against an officeholder because of the source of his pay or compensation.

We hold that the case was properly removed under the
federal officer removal statute, 28 U. S. C. $ 1442(a)(3), and
that the Tax Injunction Act, $ 1341, does not bar federalcourt adjudication. We further conclude that Jefferson
County's tax operates as a nondiscriminatory tax on the
judges' compensation, to which the Public Salary Tax Act of
1939, 4 U. S. C. $ 111, consents.

Opinion of the Court

I
A
Alabama counties, as entities created by the State, can im-pose no tax absent state authorization. See Estes v. Gadsden, 266 Ala. 166, 170, 94 So. 2d 744, 747 (1957). Alabama,the parties to this litigation agree, has not authorized its
counties to levy an income tax. See Jefferson County v.Acker, 850 F. Supp. 1536, 1537-1538, n. 2 (ND Ala. 1994);
McPheeter v. Auburn, 288 Ala. 286, 292, 259 So. 2d 833, 837(1972);

Estes, 266 Ala., at 171-172, 94 So. 2d, at 748-750.1 In1967, Alabama authorized its counties to levy a "license or

privilege tax" upon persons who do not pay any other licensetax to either the State or county. 1967 Ala. Acts 406, $ 3.
As stated in the authorization, a county may impose the tax"upon any person for engaging in any business" for which
a license or privilege tax is not required by either the Stateof Alabama or the county under the laws of the State of
Alabama. $ 4.Pursuant to Alabama's authorization, Jefferson County, in
1987, enacted Ordinance Number 1120, "establish[ing] a li-cense or privilege tax on persons engaged in any vocation,
occupation, calling or profession in [the] County who is notrequired by law to pay any license or privilege tax to either
the State of Alabama or the County." Ordinance No. 1120,preamble (1987) (Ordinance or Ordinance No. 1120). The
Ordinance declares it "unlawful . . . to engage in" a coveredoccupation without paying the tax. $ 2. Included among
those subject to the tax are "hold[ers] of any kind of officeor position either by election or appointment, by any federal,
state, county or city officer or employee where the services

1 Most States, it appears, like Alabama, have not authorized local imposition of an "income tax." See J. Aronson & J. Hilley, Financing State and
Local Governments 149 (4th ed. 1986) ("Eleven states have authorized

Tax Guide || 15-100, p. 3512 (1998) (listing cities in 11 States that impose
personal income taxes).

of such official or employee are rendered within JeffersonCounty." $ 1(C). The fee is measured by one-half percent

of the "gross receipts" of the person subject to the tax. $ 2."[G]ross receipts" is defined as having "the same meaning"
as "compensation," and includes "all salaries, wages, commis-sions, [and] bonuses." $ 1(F). Ordinance No. 1120 thus
implements the taxing authority accorded counties by theAlabama Legislature. The State's permission left no room
for a local tax on compensation of a different name or order.

B
Respondents William M. Acker, Jr., and U. W. Clemon areUnited States District Judges for the Northern District

of Alabama. Both maintain their principal office in Jef-ferson County, and both resist payment of the county's
"license or privilege tax" on the ground that it violatesthe intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine. The county

instituted a collection suit in Alabama small claims courtagainst each of the judges, which each removed to the Federal District Court under the federal officer removal statute,28 U. S. C. $ 1442 (1994 ed. and Supp. III). After denying
the county's motions to remand, the federal court consoli-dated the cases, and eventually granted summary judgment
for respondents; the court held Jefferson County's tax un-constitutional under the intergovernmental tax immunity
doctrine to the extent that the tax reached the compensationof federal judges. See Jefferson County, 850 F. Supp., at
1537, 1545-1546.2

2 The District Court also held that applying the tax to the judges
diminished their pay and therefore violated the Compensation Clause
of Article III of the Constitution. See Jefferson County v. Acker, 850
F. Supp., at 1548; U. S. Const., Art. III, $ 1 (federal judges "shall . . . receive
for their Services, a Compensation, which shall not be diminished during
their Continuance in Office"). The Court of Appeals declined to address
that question, and it is not before this Court. See Jefferson County v.
Acker, 92 F. 3d 1561, 1566 (CA11 1996) (en banc).

Opinion of the Court
A panel of the United States Court of Appeals for theEleventh Circuit initially reversed the District Court's judgment, Jefferson County v. Acker, 61 F. 3d 848 (1995), but theCircuit, sitting en banc, affirmed the District Court's disposition, Jefferson County v. Acker, 92 F. 3d 1561, 1576 (1996).We granted Jefferson County's initial petition for certiorari
and remanded the case for further consideration of the ques-tion whether the Tax Injunction Act, 28 U. S. C. $ 1341, deprived the District Court of jurisdiction to adjudicate thematter.

Jefferson County v. Acker, 520 U. S. 1261 (1997).On remand, the Eleventh Circuit adhered to its prior en banc

decision. See 137 F. 3d 1314, 1324 (1998) (en banc). Weagain granted certiorari to consider both the threshold Tax
Injunction Act issue and the merits of the case. 525 U. S.1039-1040 (1998). We take up as well an anterior question
raised by the Solicitor General: Was removal from statecourt to federal court unauthorized by the federal officer
removal statute? II

The federal officer removal provision at issue states:

"(a) A civil action or criminal prosecution commencedin a State court against any of the following may be

removed by them to the district court of the UnitedStates for the district and division embracing the place
wherein it is pending:. . . . .

"(3) Any officer of the courts of the United States, forany act under color of office or in the performance of his
duties." 28 U. S. C. $ 1442 (1994 ed. and Supp. III).3
It is the general rule that an action may be removed fromstate court to federal court only if a federal district court

would have original jurisdiction over the claim in suit. See28 U. S. C. $ 1441(a). To remove a case as one falling within

3 Other subsections of $ 1442 establish similar removal rights for other
federal officers. See 28 U. S. C. $$ 1442(a), (b) (1994 ed. and Supp. III).

Opinion of the Court
federal-question jurisdiction, the federal question ordinarily
must appear on the face of a properly pleaded complaint; an
anticipated or actual federal defense generally does not qualify a case for removal. See Louisville & Nashville R. Co.
v. Mottley, 211 U. S. 149, 152 (1908). Suits against federal
officers are exceptional in this regard. Under the federal
officer removal statute, suits against federal officers may be
removed despite the nonfederal cast of the complaint; the
federal-question element is met if the defense depends on
federal law.

To qualify for removal, an officer of the federal courts must
both raise a colorable federal defense, see Mesa v. California, 489 U. S. 121, 139 (1989), and establish that the suit is
"for a[n] act under color of office," 28 U. S. C. $ 1442(a)(3) (emphasis added). To satisfy the latter requirement, the officer
must show a nexus, a " `causal connection' between the
charged conduct and asserted official authority." Willingham v. Morgan, 395 U. S. 402, 409 (1969) (quoting Maryland
v. Soper (No. 1), 270 U. S. 9, 33 (1926)).

In construing the colorable federal defense requirement,
we have rejected a "narrow, grudging interpretation" of the
statute, recognizing that "one of the most important reasons
for removal is to have the validity of the defense of official
immunity tried in a federal court." 395 U. S., at 407. We
therefore do not require the officer virtually to "win his case
before he can have it removed." Ibid. Here, the judges

argued, and the Eleventh Circuit held, that Jefferson County's tax falls on "the performance of federal judicial duties
in Jefferson County" and "risk[s] interfering with the operation of the federal judiciary" in violation of the intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine; that argument, although we
ultimately reject it, see infra, at 435-443, presents a colorable federal defense. Jefferson County, 92 F. 3d, at 1572.
There is no dispute on this point. See post, at 448 (Scalia,
J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).

432 JEFFERSON COUNTY v. ACKER

Opinion of the Court
We next consider whether the judges have shown that thecounty's tax collection suits are "

for a[n] act under color of
office." 28 U. S. C. $ 1442(a)(3) (emphasis added). The es-sence of the judges' colorable defense is that Jefferson County's Ordinance expressly declares it "unlawful" for them to
"engage in [their] occupation" without paying the tax, Ordi-nance No. 1120, $ 2, and thus subjects them to an impermissible licensing scheme. The judges accordingly see JeffersonCounty's enforcement actions as suits "for" their having "engage[d] in [their] occupation." The Solicitor General, in con-trast, argues that there is no causal connection between the
suits and the judges' official acts because "[t]he tax . . . was
imposed only upon [the judges] personally and not upon the
United States or upon any instrumentality of the United
States." Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 20. To
choose between those readings of the Ordinance is to decide
the merits of this case. Just as requiring a "clearly sustainable defense" rather than a colorable defense would defeat
the purpose of the removal statute, Willingham, 395 U. S.,
at 407, so would demanding an airtight case on the merits in
order to show the required causal connection. Accordingly,
we credit the judges' theory of the case for purposes of both
elements of our jurisdictional inquiry and conclude that the
judges have made an adequate threshold showing that the
suit is "for a[n] act under color of office." 28 U. S. C.

$ 1442(a)(3).

Justice Scalia maintains that the county's lawsuit was
not grandly "for" the judges' performance of their official
duties, but narrowly "for" their having refused to pay the
tax. The judges' resistance to payment of the tax, he states,
was neither required by the responsibilities of their offices
nor undertaken in the course of job performance. See post,
at 447. The county's lawsuit, however, was not simply "for"
a refusal; it was "for" payment of a tax. The county asserted that the judges had failed to comply with the Ordinance; read literally, as the judges urge and as we accept

Opinion of the Court
solely for purposes of this jurisdictional inquiry, that meas-ure required the judges to pay a license fee before "engag[ing] in [their] occupation." Ordinance No. 1120, $ 2. Thecircumstances that gave rise to the tax liability, not just the
taxpayers' refusal to pay, "constitute the basis" for the taxcollection lawsuits at issue. See

Willingham, 395 U. S., at409 (" It is enough that [petitioners'] acts or [their] presence

at the place in performance of [their] official duty constitutethe basis . . . of the state prosecution." (internal quotation
marks omitted)). Here, those circumstances encompassholding court in the county and receiving income for that
activity. In this light, we are satisfied that the judges haveshown the essential nexus between their activity "under
color of office" and the county's demand, in the collectionsuits, for payment of the local tax.

The Tax Injunction Act provides:

"The district courts shall not enjoin, suspend or re-strain the assessment, levy or collection of any tax under

State law where a plain, speedy and efficient remedymay be had in the courts of such State." 28 U. S. C.

$ 1341.
This statutory text "is to be enforced according to its terms"and should be interpreted to advance "its purpose" of "confin[ing] federal-court intervention in state government."
Arkansas v. Farm Credit Servs. of Central Ark., 520 U. S.821, 826-827 (1997). By its terms, the Act bars anticipatory

relief, suits to stop ("enjoin, suspend or restrain") the collec-tion of taxes. Recognizing that there is "little practical difference" between an injunction and anticipatory relief in theform of a declaratory judgment, the Court has held that declaratory relief falls within the Act's compass. Californiav.

Grace Brethren Church, 457 U. S. 393, 408 (1982). But asuit to collect a tax is surely not brought to restrain state

Opinion of the Court
action, and therefore does not fit the Act's description of suitsbarred from federal district court adjudication. See Louisiana Land & Exploration Co. v. Pilot Petroleum Corp., 900F. 2d 816, 818 (CA5 1990) ("The Tax Injunction Act does
not bar federal court jurisdiction [of a] suit . . . to collect astate tax.").

Nevertheless, in Keleher v. New England Telephone &
Telegraph Co., 947 F. 2d 547 (CA2 1991), the Court ofAppeals concluded:

"[I]n removing the federal courts' power to `enjoin,suspend or restrain' state and local taxes, [Congress]
necessarily intended for federal courts to abstain fromhearing tax enforcement actions in which the validity
of a state or local tax might reasonably be raised as adefense."

Id., at 551.4

We do not agree that the Act's purpose requires us to dis-regard the text formulation Congress adopted.

Congress modeled the Tax Injunction Act, which passedin 1937, upon previously enacted federal "statutes of similar
import," measures that parallel state laws barring "actionsin State courts to enjoin the collection of State and county
taxes." S. Rep. No. 1035, 75th Cong., 1st Sess., 1 (1937).The federal statute Congress had in plain view was an 1867
measure depriving courts of jurisdiction over suits brought"for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection"
of any federal tax. Act of Mar. 2, 1867, ch. 169, $ 10, 14 Stat.475, now codified at 26 U. S. C. $ 7421(a) (1994 ed., Supp. III).
The 1867 provision, of course, does not bar federal-court ad4 The Second Circuit further stated that "[e]ven if Congress did not intend the Act's jurisdictional bar to reach so far, . . . we believe that general
principles of federal court abstention would nonetheless require us to stay
our hand here." 947 F. 2d, at 551. Keleher was a diversity action raising
" `difficult questions of state law bearing on policy problems of substantial
public import.' " Ibid. (quoting Colorado River Water Conservation
Dist. v. United States, 424 U. S. 800, 814 (1976)). See infra, at 435, n. 5.

Opinion of the Court
judication of suits initiated by the United States to collectfederal taxes; it precludes only suits brought by taxpayers

to restrain the United States from assessing or collectingsuch taxes. Similarly, the state laws to which Congress referred surely do not preclude the States from enforcing theirtaxes in court.

The Tax Injunction Act was thus shaped by state and fed-eral provisions barring anticipatory actions by taxpayers to
stop the tax collector from initiating collection proceedings.It was not the design of these provisions to prohibit taxpayers from defending suits brought by a government to obtaincollection of a tax. Congress, it appears, sought particularly
to stop out-of-state corporations from using diversity juris-diction to gain injunctive relief against a state tax in federal
court, an advantage unavailable to in-state taxpayers deniedanticipatory relief under state law. See S. Rep. No. 1035,
supra, at 2. In sum, we hold that the Tax Injunction Act,as indicated by its terms and purpose, does not bar collection
suits, nor does it prevent taxpayers from urging defenses insuch suits that the tax for which collection is sought is
invalid.5 IV

The Eleventh Circuit held that Jefferson County's licensetax, as applied to federal judges, amounts to "a direct tax on
the federal government or its instrumentalities" in violationof the intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine. Jefferson

F. 2d 547, 551 (CA2 1991), see supra, at 434, n. 4, abstention and stay
doctrines may counsel federal courts to withhold adjudication, according
priority to state courts on questions concerning the meaning and proper
application of a state tax law. Cf. Burford v. Sun Oil Co., 319 U. S. 315,
332-334 (1943); Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co., 517 U. S. 706, 719-721
(1996) (in a case seeking damages, rather than equitable relief, a federal
court may not abstain, but can stay the action pending resolution of the
state-law issue). No one has argued for the application of such doctrines here.

436 JEFFERSON COUNTY v. ACKER

Opinion of the Court
County, 92 F. 3d, at 1576. That ruling extends the doctrinebeyond the tight limits this Court has set and is inconsistent

with the controlling federal statute. The county's Ordi-nance lays no "demands directly on the Federal Government," United States v. New Mexico, 455 U. S. 720, 735(1982); it is, and operates as, a tax on employees' compensation. The Public Salary Tax Act allows a State and itstaxing authorities to tax the pay federal employees receive
"if the taxation does not discriminate against the [federal]employee because of the source of the pay or compensation."
4 U. S. C. $ 111. We hold that Jefferson County's tax fallswithin that allowance.

A
Until 1938, the intergovernmental tax immunity doctrinewas expansively applied to prohibit Federal and State Governments from taxing the salaries of another sovereign's em-ployees. See,

e. g., Dobbins v. Commissioners of Erie Cty.,16 Pet. 435, 450 (1842);

Collector v. Day, 11 Wall. 113, 124
(1871). In Graves v. New York ex rel. O'Keefe, 306 U. S. 466,486-487 (1939), the Court expressly overruled prior decisions and held that a State's imposition of a tax on federalemployees' salaries "lays [no] unconstitutional burden upon
[the Federal Government]." 6 Although taxes "upon the in-comes of employees of a government, state or national, . . .
may be passed on economically to that government," theCourt reasoned, the federal design tolerates such "indirect
[and] incidental" burdens. Id., at 487. Since Graves, we

6 Graves carried out the doctrinal contraction presaged in Helvering v.
Gerhardt, 304 U. S. 405, 424 (1938), which held that the Federal Government could tax the salaries of employees of the Port of New York Authority. See also James v. Dravo Contracting Co., 302 U. S. 134, 138, 149,
159-161 (1937) (in determining that a state "privilege ta[x]" on federal
contractors did not violate the intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine,
the Court rejected the theory that a tax on income is a tax on its source
(internal quotation marks omitted)).

have reaffirmed "a narrow approach to governmental taximmunity," New Mexico, 455 U. S., at 735;

7 we have closely

confined the doctrine to "ba[r] only those taxes that [are]imposed directly on one sovereign by the other or that

discriminat[e] against a sovereign or those with whom it
deal[s]," Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489 U. S. 803,811 (1989). In contracting the once expansive intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine, we have recognized that thearea is one over which Congress is the principal superintendent. See New Mexico, 455 U. S., at 737-738.Indeed, congressional action coincided with the

Graves
turnaround. In the Public Salary Tax Act, under consider-ation before

Graves was announced and enacted shortly
thereafter, see Davis, 489 U. S., at 811-812, Congress consented to nondiscriminatory state and local taxation of fed-eral employees' "pay or compensation for personal service,"

4 U. S. C. $ 111.8 Section 111 effectively "codified the resultin

Graves," and thereby "foreclosed the possibility that subsequent judicial reconsideration . . . might reestablish thebroader interpretation of the immunity doctrine."

Davis,
489 U. S., at 812; see also id., at 813 (the immunity for which$ 111 provides is "coextensive with the prohibition against

discriminatory taxes embodied in the modern constitutionaldoctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity").

7 New Mexico held that New Mexico transgressed no constitutional limit
when it required federal contractors to pay the State's gross receipts tax
for the "privilege" of doing business with the Federal Government in the
State. 455 U. S., at 727, 744 (internal quotation marks omitted).

8 Section 111 provides:

"The United States consents to the taxation of pay or compensation for
personal service as an officer or employee of the United States, a territory
or possession or political subdivision thereof, the government of the District of Columbia, or an agency or instrumentality of one or more of the
foregoing, by a duly constituted taxing authority having jurisdiction, if
the taxation does not discriminate against the officer or employee because
of the source of the pay or compensation."

438 JEFFERSON COUNTY v. ACKER

Opinion of the Court
In Howard v. Commissioners of Sinking Fund of Louis-ville, 344 U. S. 624 (1953), the Court held that a "license fee"

similar in relevant respects to Jefferson County's was an "in-come tax" for purposes of a federal statute that defines "income tax" as "any tax levied on, with respect to, or measuredby, net income, gross income, or gross receipts," 4 U. S. C.

$ 110(c). See 344 U. S., at 625, n. 2, 629.9 The Court so con-cluded even though the local tax was styled as "a tax upon
the privilege of working within [the municipality]," was notan "income tax" under state law, and deviated from textbook
income tax characteristics. Id., at 628-629; see also id., at629 (Douglas, J., dissenting) ("Many kinds of income are excluded, e. g., dividends, interest, capital gains. The exclu-sions emphasize that the tax is on the

privilege of workingor doing business in [the municipality].").

10

9 Howard construed the Buck Act, which authorizes state and local governments to collect "income tax[es]" from individuals who work in a "Federal area" "to the same extent . . . as though such area was not a Federal
area." 4 U. S. C. $ 106(a). The Buck Act defines "Federal area" to mean
"any lands or premises held or acquired by or for the use of the United
States." $ 110(e). The United States submits that "[t]his definition appears, by its terms, to encompass premises used by the United States for
the purposes of operating a federal courthouse," but further notes that
the "origin and purpose of the Buck Act . . . were . . . limited . . . to
ensur[ing] that federal officers and employees who reside or work within
exclusive federal enclaves would be treated equally with those who reside
and work outside such areas." Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae
28, n. 8 (citing S. Rep. No. 1625, 76th Cong., 3d Sess., 3 (1940)). As we
conclude that the Public Salary Tax Act consents to Jefferson County's
tax, we need not decide whether the Buck Act applies to this case.

10 Justice Breyer both recapitulates the reasoning of Justice Douglas'

dissenting opinion in Howard and endeavors to distinguish the Court's
decision in that case as involving "only [a] jurisdictional issue." Post, at
457 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part). One of the two
questions on which the Court granted certiorari in Howard, however, explicitly asked the Court to determine "[t]he validity of the Louisville occupational tax or license fee ordinance as applied to employees of the [Naval]
Ordnance Plant." 344 U. S., at 625. The Court squarely held: "[T]he tax
is valid." Id., at 629.

439Cite as: 527 U. S. 423 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
As Howard indicates, whether Jefferson County's licensetax fits within the Public Salary Tax Act's allowance is a

question of federal law. The practical impact, not theState's name tag, determines the answer to that question.
See also Detroit v. Murray Corp. of America, 355 U. S. 489,492 (1958) ("[I]n determining whether th[e] ta[x] violate[s]
the Government's constitutional immunity we must lookthrough form and behind labels to substance."); cf.

Ohio OilCo. v. Conway, 281 U. S. 146, 159 (1930) (compatibly with the

Fourteenth Amendment, a State "may impose different spe-cific taxes upon different trades and professions"; "[i]n levying such taxes, the State is not required to resort to closedistinctions or to maintain a precise, scientific uniformity
with reference to composition, use or value"). This much isbeyond genuine debate.

B
The judges acknowledge that Jefferson County's Ordi-nance is valid if it "impose[s] a true tax on . . . income," but

argue that the Ordinance ranks instead as an impermissiblelicensing scheme. Brief for Respondents 13-14, 27-33.
Two aspects of the Ordinance, they say, remove the tax fromthe Public Salary Tax Act shelter for "taxation of pay or
compensation for personal service," 4 U. S. C. $ 111, and ren-der the tax unconstitutional. First, the judges urge, the
very words of the Ordinance make it unlawful for them andothers to engage in their occupations without paying the license fee. Second, they maintain, the complete exclusion ofpersons who hold other Alabama licenses, however low the
fee in comparison to Jefferson County's tax, is inconsistentwith a true tax on income, but entirely consistent with a
regulatory scheme requiring persons to have one and onlyone occupational license in a State. We are not persuaded.

Jefferson County's Ordinance declares it "unlawful . . . toengage in" a covered occupation (as pertinent here, to carry
out the duties of a federal judge) without paying the licensefee. Ordinance No. 1120, $ 2. Based on the quoted words,

527US1 Unit: $U81 [05-02-01 19:09:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN
440 JEFFERSON COUNTY v. ACKER

Opinion of the Court
the respondent judges urge, as the Eleventh Circuit ruled,
that the Ordinance is invalid under Johnson v. Maryland,
254 U. S. 51, 57 (1920), which held that a State could not
require a federal postal employee to obtain a state driver's
license before performing his federal duties. See Jefferson
County, 92 F. 3d, at 1572-1573. In reading the Ordinance
to impose a license requirement resembling the driver's license at issue in Johnson, the judges stress the Ordinance's
incautious "unlawful . . . to engage in" language. Those
words, however, likely were written with nonfederal employees, the vast majority of the occupational taxpayers, in front
view. As earlier observed, see supra, at 439, the actual operation of the Ordinance, i. e., its practical impact, is critical.
See Murray Corp., 355 U. S., at 492.

In practice, Jefferson County's license tax serves a
revenue-raising, not a regulatory, purpose. Jefferson
County neither issues licenses to taxpayers, nor in any way
regulates them in the performance of their duties based on
their status as licensed taxpayers. Cf. Johnson, 254 U. S.,
at 57 ("[The state license requirement] lays hold of [Federal
Government employees] in their specific attempt to obey
[federal] orders and requires qualifications in addition to
those that the [Federal] Government has pronounced sufficient."); Leslie Miller, Inc. v. Arkansas, 352 U. S. 187, 189,
190 (1956) (per curiam) (holding that private contractors,
seeking to bid on federal contracts, cannot be required first
to submit to state licensing procedures that "determin[e]" a
contractor's "qualifications"; such state regulation is inconsistent with the governing federal procurement statute
and regulations, which provide standards for judging the
"responsibility" of competitive bidders (internal quotation
marks omitted)). In response to the judges' refusal to pay
the tax, Jefferson County has done no more than institute
a collection suit. See Jefferson County, 92 F. 3d, at 1565.
Alabama, of course, cannot make it unlawful to carry out the

Opinion of the Court
duties of a federal office without local permission, and in fact
does not endeavor to do so.11

We consider next the judges' argument that the wholesale
exemption for those who hold another state or county license
reveals the Ordinance's true character as a licensing scheme,
not an income tax. If the tax were genuinely an income
tax, they urge, those license holders would not be excluded,
although they might be allowed to claim their other license
fees as credits or deductions against the county tax. Alabama's enabling Act does not allow its counties to so provide;
those otherwise subject to license or privilege taxes under

11 The shortcomings Justice Breyer identifies in his first three objections, post, at 449-452, are of a sort this Court routinely rejects as cause
for federal curtailment of the taxing power of state and local governments.
See Ohio Oil Co. v. Conway, 281 U. S. 146, 159 (1930). His fourth objection, post, at 452-453, speaks of burdens Jefferson County imposes directly
on the Federal Government--obligations to withhold the tax, to make
complicated calculations, to keep detailed records. Justice Breyer
overlooks that it is the actual operation of the Ordinance--what is and not
what might be--that counts in determining the merits of this case. See
Detroit v. Murray Corp. of America, 355 U. S. 489, 492 (1958).

As a matter of undisputed fact, the burdens Justice Breyer posits are
hypothetical, not real. As the parties stipulated, "[a]ll active judges of
the Northern District of Alabama except [respondents] have paid the
County Occupational Tax on differing percentages of their judicial salaries," but "neither the Administrative Office of the United States Courts
nor any Article III judge in the Northern District of Alabama . . . has
ever made an oath certifying the alleged amounts of a federal judge's salary earned within and without Jefferson County," and "[t]he Administrative Office . . . has never withheld County Occupational Tax from any
federal judge or court employee." Jefferson County, 850 F. Supp., at
1549; see also 5 U. S. C. $ 5520(a) (authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury to enter into tax withholding agreements with local taxing authorities). Should Jefferson County someday exceed constitutional limits in
its enforcement endeavors, a federal court would no doubt conserve what
is constitutional, in line with the severability clauses contained in the state
law and county Ordinance. See 1967 Ala. Acts 406, $ 8; Jefferson County
Ordinance No. 1120, $ 13 (1987).

442 JEFFERSON COUNTY v. ACKER

Opinion of the Court
Alabama's laws may not be reached by a county's occupa-tional tax. See 1967 Ala. Acts 406, $ 4.

12 The dispositive

measure, however, is the Public Salary Tax Act, which doesnot require the local tax to be a typical "income tax." Just

as the statute in Howard consented broadly to "any taxmeasured by net income, gross income, or gross receipts,"
344 U. S., at 629, the Public Salary Tax Act consents to anytax on "pay or compensation," which Jefferson County's
surely is. The sole caveat is that the tax "not dis-criminate . . . because of the [federal] source of the pay or
compensation," 4 U. S. C. $ 111, and we next consider thatmatter.

13

C
In Davis, the Court held that a state tax exempting retire-ment benefits paid by the State but not those paid by the

Federal Government violated the Public Salary Tax Act'snondiscrimination requirement. See 489 U. S., at 817-818.
Jefferson County's tax, by contrast, does not discriminate

12 Justice Breyer observes that these exemptions are various, numerous, and large. See post, at 451-452, 458-464. In this regard, we note
the representation of counsel for Jefferson County at oral argument that
"92 percent of the people who earn wages in [the] county pay [the] tax."
Tr. of Oral Arg. 14. Counsel further stated that federal employees are at
least proportionately represented among the eight percent exempt from
the county's tax because they pay license fees to the State of Alabama.
These figures are not in the record, counsel explained, "because this issue
was never raised until we got to this Court." Ibid.; see also id., at 14-15
(counsel for Jefferson County represented that of 12,000 federal employees
in the county, 1,209 pay state license taxes and do not pay the county's
occupational tax).

13 The District Court ruled that the judges had failed to establish that

the county's tax discriminates against federal officers or employees because of the source of their pay or compensation. See Jefferson County,
850 F. Supp., at 1539-1540. On appeal there was no contention that this
determination was erroneous. See Jefferson County, 92 F. 3d, at 1566,
n. 9. The judges nevertheless press the argument that the tax is discriminatory as an alternative ground for affirmance. See Brief for Respondents 34-37.

Opinion of the Court
against federal judges in particular, or federal officeholders
in general, based on the federal source of their pay or compensation. The tax is paid by all State District and Circuit
Court judges in Jefferson County and the three State Supreme Court justices who have satellite offices in the county.
See Jefferson County, 850 F. Supp., at 1549.

The judges urge that, as federal judges can never fit within
the county's exemption for those who hold licenses under
other state or county laws, that exemption unlawfully disfavors them. See Brief for Respondents 14-15. The record
shows no discrimination, however, between similarly situated federal and state employees. Cf. Davis, 489 U. S., at
814 ("It is undisputed that Michigan's tax system discriminates in favor of retired state employees and against retired
federal employees."). Should Alabama or Jefferson County
authorities take to exempting state officials while leaving
federal officials (or a subcategory of them) subject to the tax,
that would indeed present a starkly different case. Here,
however, there is no sound reason to deny Alabama counties
the right to tax with an even hand the compensation of federal, state, and local officeholders whose services are rendered within the county. See United States v. County of
Fresno, 429 U. S. 452, 462 (1977) (upholding requirement that
employees of U. S. Forest Service pay California property
tax on homes located on federal land and provided to employees as part of their compensation; Court observed that state
tax does not discriminate unconstitutionally against federal
employees if the tax is "imposed equally on . . . similarly
situated constituents of the State").

For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for proceedings
consistent with this opinion.

An officer of the federal courts may remove an actioncommenced against him in state court "

for any act undercolor of office or in the performance of his duties." 28

U. S. C. $ 1442(a)(3) (emphasis added). In my view, respond-ents have failed to show a " `causal connection' between the
charged conduct and asserted official authority," Willingham v. Morgan, 395 U. S. 402, 409 (1969). I therefore dis-sent from Part II of the Court's opinion.

Respondents read Ordinance No. 1120 as creating morethan tax liability; in their view, the ordinance makes it unlawful to work if the tax goes unpaid. Building upon thisreading, they assert that the county has sued them for performing their duties without a license, a complaint thatwould clearly establish the causal connection required by
28 U. S. C. $ 1442(a)(3). This theory, however, is simply in-consistent with the complaints the county filed. It may perhaps be possible under Alabama law for the county to bringa misdemeanor prosecution against one who engages in a
business or profession without having paid the requiredlicense fee; and the county may perhaps have a right to
enjoin the conduct of a business or the practice of a profes-sion when the license fee has not been paid. But no such
action is before us here. Instead, the county has sued eachof these respondents for refusing to pay the fee, as evidenced
by the fact that the only relief it sought was the money due.See Complaints in Nos. DV9209643 and DV9209695 (Jefferson County District Court). When identifying, for purposes
of $ 1442(a)(3), what a suit is "for," it is necessary to focus,not on grounds of liability that the plaintiff

could assert, but
on the ground actually asserted. Regardless of whetherOrdinance No. 1120 also purports to proscribe working without a license, these suits were only about respondents' re-fusal to pay the tax. That refusal is thus the act to which

Opinion of Scalia, J.
we should look in determining whether these suits were
brought "for any act under color of office or in the performance of [official] duties."

Refusing to pay a tax, even an unconstitutional one, is
not an action required by respondents' official duties, nor an
action taken in the course of performing their official duties
(as was, for example, the alleged physical abuse of an inmate
by prison officials in Willingham, supra). Judges Acker and
Clemon may well have been motivated by a desire to vindicate the interests of the Federal Judiciary. But their refusal
to turn over money from their personal funds was not related
to the responsibilities of their judicial office.

The opinion for the Court does not dispute this. Instead,
it claims that holding the causation requirement unsatisfied
would merge the merits issue with the removal issue. Ante,
at 432. Since, the Court appears to reason, this fee might
be unconstitutional if it is imposed upon the function of
being a federal judge (the merits question), holding that
these suits were not brought "for" their being federal judges
would in effect decide the merits. That is illogical. What
the fee is imposed upon, and what the suits are for are two
different questions.1 If the cases were remanded to state
court, respondents would remain free to argue that the
burden of this exaction is upon the function of being a federal judge, rather than upon income. To be sure, the facts
would be more favorable for that argument if the ordinance
had been enforced by a different sort of suit, which would
have qualified for removal--for example, suits seeking to en1 Some confusion may have resulted from the fact that the Government
argued this issue in a way that did conflate the merits with removal. See
ante, at 432. It said that there was no causal connection because "[t]he
tax . . . was imposed only upon [the judges] personally and not upon the
United States or upon any instrumentality of the United States." Brief
for United States as Amicus Curiae 20. As I explain above, however,
proving who the fee was imposed upon does not answer the question of
what the suit is for.

join respondents from performing their duties rather than
suits to collect the unpaid "license fee." But even in the
present suits, which do not qualify for removal, respondents
could argue that this is a charge prohibited by the intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine. Deciding that the
cases were improperly removed would simply mean that
that defense would have to be made in state court. For although the removal statute creates an exception to the wellpleaded-complaint doctrine, the exception is not for all
federal-question defenses asserted by federal officials, but
rather for all suits "for any act under color of office or in
the performance of [official] duties."

It is enough for the Court that respondents have identified
some connection, albeit remote, with their federal offices.
See ibid. The majority says that all the circumstances giving rise to these suits must be considered, and "those circumstances encompass holding court in the county and receiving
income for that activity." Ante, at 433. In other words,
but for the judges' working--an act unquestionably within
the scope of their official duties--they would not have owed
taxes under Ordinance No. 1120 and thus would not have
been sued. "But for" causation, however, is not enough.

In Maryland v. Soper (No. 2), 270 U. S. 36 (1926), four
prohibition agents and their chauffeur were prosecuted in
state court for lying under oath to the state coroner, and
they sought to remove the case under a predecessor of the
current federal-officer removal statute.2 According to the

2 Section 33 of the Judicial Code provided:
"That when any civil suit or criminal prosecution is commenced in any
court of a State against any officer appointed under or acting by authority
of any revenue law of the United States . . . or against any person acting
under or by authority of any such officer, on account of any act done under
color of his office . . . the said suit or prosecution may at any time before
the trial or final hearing thereof be removed for trial into the district court
next to be holden in the district where the same is pending . . . ." 39
Stat. 532, ch. 399.

agents, they were on their way to report to their superior
about a freshly discovered illegal still when they came upon
a mortally wounded man in the road. Had they not been en
route to their superior, the agents argued, they would never
have made the discovery that required them to testify before
the coroner. We rejected the argument that this established a sufficient connection between their official duty and
the obstruction-of-justice prosecution. Although reporting
to their superior was certainly among their official duties,
the act of testifying before the coroner was not, and it was
the latter act "on account of " which (or in the terms of the
current removal statute, "for" which) they were prosecuted.
Id., at 42. So also here, it is not enough that respondents'
performance of their judicial duties was a link in the chain
of events that brought about these suits--that had they not
performed their official duties, the fee would not have been
assessed, and had the fee not been assessed they would not
have been sued for failure to pay it. Acker and Clemon
were sued for their refusal to pay the tax--and that, as I
have said, is not an act required by, or even performed in
connection with, cf. Willingham v. Morgan, 395 U. S. 402
(1969), the duties of their judicial office.

None of this is to suggest, of course, that removal is justified only when the federal officer can prove that the act
prompting suit is, beyond doubt, an official one. If that were
the case, the merits truly would be subsumed within the
jurisdictional question of removal; the defense of qualified
immunity, for example, would always be resolved as a threshold jurisdictional question--an odd result when the main
point of 28 U. S. C. $ 1443 is to give officers a federal forum
in which to litigate the merits of immunity defenses. See
Willingham v. Morgan, supra, at 407. The point is only
that the officer should have to identify as the gravamen of
the suit an act that was, if not required by, at least closely
connected with, the performance of his official functions. 28

U. S. C. $ 1443; Maryland v. Soper (No. 1), 270 U. S. 9,33 (1926); Willingham v. Morgan, supra, at 407-409. What

should defeat respondents here is that even though their fed-eral defense is colorable, their claim to have acted in official

For the foregoing reasons, I would hold that this case wasimproperly removed. In view, however, of the decision of a

majority of the Court to reach the merits, I join Parts I, III,and IV of the Court's opinion. Cf. Edgar v. MITE Corp.,
457 U. S. 624, 646 (1982) (Powell, J., concurring in part);United States v. Jorn, 400 U. S. 470, 488 (1971) (Black, J.,
concurring in judgment).

Justice Breyer, with whom Justice O'Connor joins,concurring in part and dissenting in part.

I agree that we have jurisdiction to hear the merits of thiscase, and I join Parts I, II, and III of the Court's opinion.
I do not agree with the majority, however, about the consti-tutionality of the tax.

If Jefferson County's license fee amounts to a tax im-posed directly upon a federal official's performance of his
official duties, it runs afoul of the intergovernmental taximmunity doctrine. See

United States v. New Mexico, 455U. S. 720, 733 (1982) ("[A] State may not, consistent with the

Supremacy Clause, U. S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2, lay a tax `di-rectly upon the United States' " (citation omitted));

Opinion of Breyer, J.
hand, if Jefferson County's license fee amounts to an in-come tax, there is no constitutional problem. See Graves v.

New York ex rel. O'Keefe, 306 U. S. 466, 486 (1939); PublicSalary Tax Act of 1939, 4 U. S. C. $ 111. The question here
is whether Jefferson County's license fee is a fee for the per-formance of official federal duties or, rather, whether it is
an income tax on federal employees. In my view, it is theformer.

I
I concede that Jefferson County measures the amount ofits tax by taking a small percentage of the "gross receipts"

or income derived from the licensed activity. JeffersonCounty Ordinance No. 1120, $ 1(F) (1987). The way in which
a State measures a tax, however, is only one relevant feature.A state law, for example, that imposed fines upon all appellate judges who took too long in issuing decisions, cf. Cal.Govt. Code Ann. $ 68210 (West 1997) (salary withheld from
tardy judges), would not suddenly become an "income tax"if the State began to measure the tax or fine, say, in terms
of a small percentage of the judge's federal income tax lia-bility. Nor would a similar tax imposed upon a judge each
time he administers an official oath automatically become an"income tax." Neither would a driver's license fee or a
motor vehicle license fee become an "income tax" shouldimaginative state legislators make the fees "progressive"
by devising some similar system of measurement. Conse-quently, one must look beyond that single feature of measurement in order to determine the nature of the tax as itoperates in practice. Cf. Lawrence v. State Tax Comm'n
of Miss., 286 U. S. 276, 280 (1932). And four specific featuresof this rather unusual tax, taken together, convince me that
it is not an "income tax."First, the language, structure, and purpose of the ordinance indicate that it imposes a fee upon the performanceof work, not a tax upon income. The ordinance is entitled
"Occupational Tax." It describes its purpose as establishing

527US1 Unit: $U81 [05-02-01 19:09:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN
450 JEFFERSON COUNTY v. ACKER

Opinion of Breyer, J.
a "license . . . tax" or a "tax" on the "privilege" of engagingin a "vocation, occupation, calling or profession." Ordinance

No. 1120, preamble. And its operative language speaks interms of a condition imposed upon work, not of a tax upon
income. It says that it

"shall be unlawful for any person to engage in or follow
[with certain exceptions] any vocation, occupation, call-ing or profession . . . without paying license fees to the

County for the privilege of engaging in or followingsuch vocation, occupation, calling or profession . . . ."

$ 2 (emphasis added).
The state law that authorizes the county's tax describes its
own purpose as one of "equaliz[ing] the burden of taxation,"and it authorizes the county "to levy a license or privilege

tax upon any person for engaging in any business" other than
a business already subject to other state or county licensingfees, liability for which is triggered, not by income, but by

engaging in the work. See 1967 Ala. Acts 406, $$ 3, 4; seegenerally Appendix,

infra, at 458-464. Indeed, the Alabama Supreme Court has found as a matter of state law thata municipal tax very similar in substance to Jefferson County's tax was an occupational license tax, rather than an in-come tax. See

McPheeter v. Auburn, 288 Ala. 286, 292, 259
So. 2d 833, 837 (1972).

Second, the tax, as measured, works more like a licensingfee than an income tax. On the one hand, the tax calculation does not include many kinds of income, such as retire-ment income, dividends, interest, or other unearned income, or earned income if that income is earned outside the
county--irrespective of how much income is involved. See
Ordinance No. 1120, $ 1(F). On the other hand, by the terms
of the ordinance, not only a county resident but also a nonresident who works some of the time in Jefferson County,

$$ 1(B), 3, must pay the tax as long as he becomes "entitled
to receive" pay for his work, even if he receives that pay

Opinion of Breyer, J.
only in a later year or never receives any income at all, see$ 1(F). And, of course, as I mentioned earlier, the event that

triggers liability is not the receipt of income but the person's"engag[ing]" in certain work. $ 2.

Third, Jefferson County's tax is riddled with exceptions,
which make sense only if one sees the tax as part of a state-wide occupational

licensing scheme, not as an income tax.
See 1967 Ala. Acts 406, $ 4 (authorizing counties to imposea license tax only in respect to occupations not subject to

state, or other county, licensing taxes). The ordinance ex-cludes from its definition of "vocation, occupation, calling
and profession" domestic servants, those engaged in occupations licensed elsewhere by the county, and those engaged in the more than 150 occupations licensed by the State.
Ordinance No. 1120, $ 1(B). This last-mentioned category is
large. Its members range from architects to amusement
park operators, from detectives to dentists, from laundry
owners to lawyers, from sewing machine operators to scientists. See generally Ala. Code $ 40-12-41 et seq. (1993);
Appendix, infra, at 458-464. And the licensing fees that
the State exacts from this range of individuals are, with only
a few exceptions, all unrelated to income. Each attorney,
for example, pays "an annual license tax to the state" in the
amount of $250, $ 40-12-49; each civil, electrical, or mechanical engineer pays $20, $ 40-12-99; and each ticket scalper
pays $100, $ 40-12-167. Some fees vary depending upon
special industry-related features, such as population (e. g.,
advertising, $ 40-12-45; amusement park operators, $ 40-12-
47), number of employees (e. g., automobile garages or shops,

$ 40-12-54), or business size (e. g., soft-drink bottlers, number of bottles per minute, $ 40-12-65; construction companies, value of orders accepted, $ 40-12-84; vending machine
operators, total sales, $ 40-12-176). License fees for a handful of businesses are measured by the income or gross receipts of the company (not of a private person). See $ 40-
16-4 (certain financial institutions); $$ 40-21-50, 40-21-53

527US1 Unit: $U81 [05-02-01 19:09:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN
452 JEFFERSON COUNTY v. ACKER

Opinion of Breyer, J.
(public utilities); $ 40-21-57 (railroad operators); $ 40-21-60("express" shipping companies).

These many exceptions to the ordinance mean that indi-viduals with identical pay earned from work performed
within Jefferson County will pay very different amounts in
license fees. Such differences are not surprising whereoccupational licensing fees are at issue, as different license

charges with different legislative pedigrees and applied todifferent industries often vary dramatically one to the next.
Cf. Ohio Oil Co. v. Conway, 281 U. S. 146, 159 (1930) (State"may impose different specific taxes upon different trades
and professions and may vary the rates of excise upon various products" without violating the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses). But I
am not aware of any income tax that would produce such
widespread differences in the tax owed by persons with identical incomes. Nor can Jefferson County separate its own
tax from the rest of the State's licensing system by claiming
that its own tax is different in kind. It would not make
sense for a county income tax to exempt an engineer entirely,
simply because he had paid the State $20 for a license; at
most a county income tax might provide a $20 deduction
from, or credit against, the amount of income tax due to the
county. But, of course, if the county's tax is simply another
licensing fee, then this structure makes sense. The engineer does not pay the county anything at all, because he has
already paid a licensing fee to the State; the county charge
would be redundant. The empirical significance of these
factors depends upon the makeup of the work force in Jefferson County (e. g., to what extent is Jefferson County made up
of bedroom communities whose residents work elsewhere), a
matter about which the record tells us nothing.

Fourth, Jefferson County's ordinance directly imposes
upon the Federal Government (the federal official's employer) burdens that to a limited extent exceed those imposed by an ordinary state or local income tax. The ordi527US1 Unit: $U81 [05-02-01 19:09:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN

453Cite as: 527 U. S. 423 (1999)
Opinion of Breyer, J.
nance requires the employer, obliged to withhold the tax,to determine where the employee has spent each working

day and apportion related wages accordingly. OrdinanceNo. 1120, $$ 3, 4. The task of apportioning an employee's
workday is more complicated and more closely connected to
official duties than simply determining where an employeeresides--the conventional "income tax" recordkeeping requirement. Similarly, a tax liability that arises from havingworked on a particular day in a particular place, together
with related and complex recordkeeping requirements, cre-ates a risk that the tax will have a practical influence upon
official decisions in a way that an ordinary income tax will
not. (Consider, for example, a federal criminal case in which
the defendant seeks a change of venue to Jefferson County.
E. g., United States v. Tokars, 839 F. Supp. 1578 (ND Ga.
1993); see Jefferson County v. Acker, 92 F. 3d 1561, 1573, and
n. 18 (CA11 1996).) Further, the ordinance's language says
it is unlawful for a federal employee who has not paid the
tax to perform his work--that is, it prohibits "engag[ing]" in
that work. Ordinance No. 1120, $ 2. This language, which
I assume could not actually authorize an injunction against
the performance of federal work, could nonetheless have an
unwelcome impact on a conscientious but tax-delinquent
judge who has sworn to uphold the law.

I recognize that one might find income taxes that embody
one or two of the features that I have just discussed. Income taxes come in many shapes and sizes. But I do not
claim that any one or two of the considerations I have mentioned is sufficient to prove my point. Rather, it is all these
features taken together that tip the balance.

The majority either ignores or attempts to distinguish
each of these features on its own, as by itself potentially
unconsitutional or found in other income taxes. Ante, at
439-442. But it is a consideration of the whole, not of each
separate part, that leads to my conclusion. To properly
characterize a tax, all of its distinguishing features must be

Opinion of Breyer, J.
properly taken into account. Each of the features discussedabove seems an odd or unusual feature of an income tax but

an ordinary feature of a licensing fee. Taken together, thesefeatures show that the tax before us is so different from an
ordinary income tax, and so much like a licensing fee, thatfor federal constitutional purposes I must conclude that Jefferson County has imposed an occupational or license tax--that is, a fee for obtaining a license to engage in official
work--just as the county in its ordinance purports to do.

II
Jefferson County argues that, in any event, the UnitedStates has consented to the imposition of the tax. It points

first to the Public Salary Tax Act of 1939, which grants fed-eral consent "to the taxation of pay or compensation for personal service as an officer or employee of the United States. . . by a duly constituted taxing authority." 4 U. S. C. $ 111.

This statute cannot help Jefferson County, however, be-cause in

Graves, this Court held only that the intergov-ernmental tax immunity doctrine does not prevent a State

from imposing a nondiscriminatory tax upon "the salariesof officers or employees of the national . . . government."
306 U. S., at 486. And the Public Salary Tax Act

"simply codified the result in Graves and foreclosed thepossibility that subsequent judicial reconsideration of

that case might reestablish the broader interpretationof the immunity doctrine." Davis v. Michigan Dept.
of Treasury, 489 U. S. 803, 812 (1989).
See also id., at 811-812 ("[D]uring most of the legislativeprocess leading to adoption of the Act it was unclear whether

state taxation of federal employees was still barred by inter-governmental tax immunity"); H. R. Rep. No. 26, 76th Cong.,
1st Sess., 2 (1939). If Jefferson County's tax is not an in-come tax and hence falls outside the scope of

Graves, thisstatute cannot save it.

455Cite as: 527 U. S. 423 (1999)
Opinion of Breyer, J.
The second statute upon which the county relies, the BuckAct, presents a more difficult question. It says:

"No person shall be relieved from liability for any in-come tax levied by any State, or by any duly constituted
taxing authority therein . . . by reason of his residingwithin a federal area or receiving income from transactions occurring or services performed in such area;and such . . . taxing authority shall have full jurisdiction
and power to levy and collect such tax in any Federalarea . . . to the same extent and with the same effect as
though such area was not a Federal area." 4 U. S. C.

$ 106(a).

A special definitional provision, which applies throughcross-reference to the Buck Act (but

not to the Public Salary
Tax Act) defines the term "income tax" broadly to include
"any tax . . . measured by . . . income, or . . . gross receipts."$ 110(c). And in

Howard v. Commissioners of Sinking Fund
of Louisville, 344 U. S. 624, 628-629 (1953), this Court heldthat a city's "license fee" measured by income and levied

on employees working at a federal plant fell within thisdefinition.

Nonetheless, the Buck Act does not apply here. Congresspassed the Buck Act in 1940 because it was uncertain
whether the consent to taxation provided in the 1939 Public
Salary Tax Act would extend to income taxes on those wholived or worked in federal areas; Congress feared that these

taxes would be barred for a special reason--namely, thatStates might lack jurisdiction to apply their laws to those
who lived or worked in such areas. See S. Rep. No. 1625,
76th Cong., 3d Sess., 3 (1940). Consequently, the Buck Act's
language consents to nothing. Rather, it says "[n]o person
shall be relieved" of liability for "any income tax" by virtue
of a particular circumstance, specifically, "by reason of " that
person's "residing within a Federal area" or his "receiving
income from transactions occurring or services performed"

Opinion of Breyer, J.
in that "area." 4 U. S. C. $ 106(a) (emphasis added). TheBuck Act seeks to prevent a person who lives or works in a

federal area from making a certain kind of legal defense totaxation, namely, the defense that the State lacks jurisdiction
to impose an income tax upon a person who lives or worksin such an area.

The Buck Act's very next phrase makes clear that the Actis limited so as to accomplish only the purpose I have just
described. It says that the state or local

"taxing authority shall have full jurisdiction and powerto levy and collect such tax in any Federal area . . . to

the same extent and with the same effect as though sucharea was not a Federal area."

Ibid. (emphasis added).

And the Buck Act adds that in any event, it "shall not bedeemed to authorize the levy or collection of any tax on . . .

the United States." $ 107(a). Thus, the Buck Act's ownlanguage indicates that the Act is not intended to alter the
contours of the intergovernmental tax immunity doctrineitself.

The case before us falls outside the Buck Act becauseno one here has asked to "be relieved" of tax liability "

by
reason of his residing within a Federal area or receiving in-come from . . . services performed in such area." $ 106(a).

Rather, the respondents claim that Jefferson County's ordi-nance is unconstitutional, not by reason of the federal nature
of where they work, but by reason of the federal nature ofwhat they do. And for the reasons discussed above, the
county's ordinance would violate the intergovernmental taximmunity doctrine

whether or not the respondents lived orworked in a federal area. The Buck Act cannot help the

county's claim because it gives the State power to tax incomeearned in a federal area only "to the same extent" and "with
the same effect as," not to a greater extent than, if that in-come were earned elsewhere. Ibid. Indeed, for the reasons I discussed earlier, Jefferson County's tax falls outsidethe Act because it is a "tax on . . . the United States."

Opinion of Breyer, J.
Nor does the Court's decision in Howard govern the out-come here. As an initial matter, Howard considered only

the jurisdictional issue I have referred to above and did notexpressly discuss whether Louisville's tax nonetheless violated the intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine for rea-sons independent of

where the federal employees lived orworked. 344 U. S., at 627-629; see also id., at 626 (taxpayers

argued that the tax was "invalid" as applied to them becausethe plant, being a federal enclave, was "not within the City");
id., at 629 (taxpayers "conceded" that the city could "levysuch a tax within its boundaries outside the federal area").

More importantly, the tax at issue in Howard, thoughstyled a "license fee for the privilege of engaging in [certain]
activities," Louisville Ordinance No. 83, $ 1 (1950) (attach-ment to Lodging of Respondents, Mar. 25, 1999), differed
from the tax at issue here in two critical ways. First, theLouisville ordinance at issue in

Howard did not make it "un-lawful" to engage in work without paying the tax. Compare

Louisville Ordinance No. 83, $ 1, with Jefferson County Ordi-nance No. 1120, $ 2. And second, the Louisville ordinance
did not exempt everyone who paid license fees under statelaw. Indeed, the ordinance specified that its license fee was
to be paid in addition to certain other license fees imposedby the city or the State. Compare Louisville Ordinance
No. 83, $ 12, with Jefferson County Ordinance No. 1120, pre-amble, $ 1(B). Thus, the provisions of the Louisville ordinance made clear that the tax it imposed was a separate andadditional tax--not an alternative--to the licensing scheme
already in place.The Jefferson County ordinance is different from the Louisville ordinance in these significant respects. And as I haveexplained, it is the cumulative nature of the unusual aspects
of the Jefferson County tax that make it an occupational orlicensing tax.

For these reasons, I would affirm the decision of the Courtof Appeals.

Per Curiam

MARYLAND v. DYSON
on petition for writ of certiorari to the court ofspecial appeals of maryland

No. 98-1062. Decided June 21, 1999
After receiving a tip from a reliable informant, sheriff's deputies stopped

and searched respondent's vehicle and found 23 grams of cocaine in the
trunk. The Court of Special Appeals reversed his drug conviction,
holding that in order for the automobile exception to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement to apply, there must not only be probable
cause to believe that evidence of a crime is contained in the car, but
also a separate finding of exigency precluding the police from obtaining
a warrant.

Held: The automobile exception does not require a separate finding of exigency in addition to a finding of probable cause. This Court's established precedent makes clear that in cases where there was probable
cause to search a vehicle, a search is not unreasonable if based on facts
that would justify issuing a warrant, even though a warrant has not
been actually obtained. E. g., United States v. Ross, 456 U. S. 798, 809.
Here, the lower court found "abundant probable cause" that the car
contained contraband, which alone satisfies the warrant requirement's
automobile exception.

Certiorari granted; 122 Md. App. 413, 712 A. 2d 573, reversed.

Per Curiam.
In this case, the Maryland Court of Special Appeals heldthat the Fourth Amendment requires police to obtain a

search warrant before searching a vehicle which they haveprobable cause to believe contains illegal drugs. Because
this holding rests upon an incorrect interpretation of the
automobile exception to the Fourth Amendment's warrant
requirement, we grant the petition for certiorari and reverse.

At 11 a.m. on the morning of July 2, 1996, a St. Mary's
County (Maryland) Sheriff 's Deputy received a tip from a
reliable confidential informant that respondent had gone to
New York to buy drugs, and would be returning to Maryland
in a rented red Toyota, license number DDY 787, later that
day with a large quantity of cocaine. The deputy investi527US1 Unit: $U82 [05-02-01 19:10:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN
466 MARYLAND v. DYSON

Per Curiam
gated the tip and found that the license number given to himby the informant belonged to a red Toyota Corolla that had

been rented to respondent, who was a known drug dealer inSt. Mary's County. When respondent returned to St. Mary's
County in the rented car at 1 a.m. on July 3, the deputies
stopped and searched the vehicle, finding 23 grams of crackcocaine in a duffel bag in the trunk. Respondent was arrested, tried, and convicted of conspiracy to possess cocainewith intent to distribute. He appealed, arguing that the
trial court had erroneously denied his motion to suppressthe cocaine on the alternative grounds that the police lacked
probable cause, or that even if there was probable cause, thewarrantless search violated the Fourth Amendment because
there was sufficient time after the informant's tip to obtain
a warrant.The Maryland Court of Special Appeals reversed, 122 Md.

App. 413, 712 A. 2d 573 (1998), holding that in order for theautomobile exception to the warrant requirement to apply,
there must not only be probable cause to believe that evi-dence of a crime is contained in the automobile, but also a
separate finding of exigency precluding the police fromobtaining a warrant.

Id., at 424, 712 A. 2d, at 578. Applying this rule to the facts of the case, the Court of Special
Appeals concluded that although there was "abundant probable cause," the search violated the Fourth Amendment because there was no exigency that prevented or even made it
significantly difficult for the police to obtain a search warrant. Id., at 426, 712 A. 2d, at 579. The Maryland Court
of Appeals denied certiorari. 351 Md. 287, 718 A. 2d 235
(1998). We grant certiorari and now reverse.

The Fourth Amendment generally requires police to secure a warrant before conducting a search. California v.
Carney, 471 U. S. 386, 390-391 (1985). As we recognized
nearly 75 years ago in Carroll v. United States, 267 U. S.
132, 153 (1925), there is an exception to this requirement for
searches of vehicles. And under our established precedent,
the "automobile exception" has no separate exigency re527US1 Unit: $U82 [05-02-01 19:10:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN

467Cite as: 527 U. S. 465 (1999)
Per Curiam
quirement. We made this clear in United States v. Ross, 456U. S. 798, 809 (1982), when we said that in cases where there

was probable cause to search a vehicle "a search is not unrea-sonable if based on facts that would justify the issuance of a
warrant, even though a warrant has not been actually obtained." (Emphasis added.) In a case with virtually iden-tical facts to this one (even down to the bag of cocaine in the

trunk of the car), Pennsylvania v. Labron, 518 U. S. 938(1996) (per curiam), we repeated that the automobile exception does not have a separate exigency requirement: "If a caris readily mobile and probable cause exists to believe it contains contraband, the Fourth Amendment . . . permits policeto search the vehicle without more."

Id., at 940.In this case, the Court of Special Appeals found that there

was "abundant probable cause" that the car contained con-traband. This finding alone satisfies the automobile exception to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement, aconclusion correctly reached by the trial court when it denied respondent's motion to suppress. The holding of theCourt of Special Appeals that the "automobile exception"
requires a separate finding of exigency in addition to a find-ing of probable cause is squarely contrary to our holdings in
Ross and Labron. We therefore grant the petition for writof certiorari and reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.*

It is so ordered.

*Justice Breyer in dissent suggests that we should not summarily
reverse a judgment in a criminal case, even though he agrees with this
opinion as a matter of law. But to adopt that position would simply leave
it in the hands of a respondent--who had obtained a lower court judgment manifestly wrong as a matter of federal constitutional law--to avoid
summary reversal by the simple expedient of refusing to file a response.
While we have on occasion appointed an attorney to file a brief as amicus
curiae in a case where we have granted certiorari, in order to be sure that
the argued case is fully briefed, we have never done so in cases which we
have summarily reversed. The reason for this is that a summary reversal
does not decide any new or unanswered question of law, but simply corrects a lower court's demonstrably erroneous application of federal law.

I agree that the Court's per curiam opinion correctlystates the law, but because respondent's counsel is not a
member of this Court's bar and did not wish to becomeone, respondent has not filed a brief in opposition to the
petition for certiorari. I believe we should not summarilyreverse in a criminal case, irrespective of the merits, where
the respondent is represented by a counsel unable to file aresponse, without first inviting an attorney to file a brief
as amicus curiae in response to the petition for certiorari.For this reason, I dissent.

No. 98-8952. Decided June 21, 1999
Pro se petitioner seeks leave to proceed in forma pauperis on her certiorari petition. The instant petition brings her total number of frivolous
filings to eight.

Held: Petitioner's motion to proceed in forma pauperis is denied. She is

barred from filing any further certiorari petitions in noncriminal cases
unless she first pays the docketing fee and submits her petition in compliance with this Court's Rule 33.1. See Martin v. District of Columbia Court of Appeals, 506 U. S. 1.

Motion denied.

Per Curiam.
Pro se petitioner Fertel-Rust seeks leave to proceed in
forma pauperis under Rule 39 of this Court. We deny thisrequest pursuant to Rule 39.8. Fertel-Rust is allowed until

July 12, 1999, within which to pay the docketing fee re-quired by Rule 38 and to submit her petition in compliance with this Court's Rule 33.1. We also direct the Clerknot to accept any further petitions for certiorari from
Fertel-Rust in noncriminal matters unless she pays thedocketing fee required by Rule 38 and submits her petition
in compliance with Rule 33.1.Fertel-Rust has abused this Court's certiorari process.
Four times in the last five years, we invoked Rule 39.8 todeny Fertel-Rust

in forma pauperis status. See FertelRust v. Dane County Social Servs., 513 U. S. 1145 (1995);Fertel-Rust v. Ambassador Hotel, 513 U. S. 1013 (1994);

Fertel-Rust v. Milwaukee Police Dept., 513 U. S. 1013 (1994);Fertel-Rust v. Milwaukee Police Dept., 513 U. S. 945 (1994).
Before these four denials, Fertel-Rust had filed three peti-tions for certiorari, all of which were both patently frivolous
and denied without recorded dissent. The instant petition

for certiorari thus brings Fertel-Rust's total number of frivo-lous filings to eight.

We enter the order barring prospective filings for thereasons discussed in Martin v. District of Columbia Court
of Appeals, 506 U. S. 1 (1992) (per curiam). Fertel-Rust'sabuse of the writ of certiorari has been in noncriminal cases,
and so we limit our sanction accordingly. The order there-fore will not prevent Fertel-Rust from petitioning to challenge criminal sanctions which might be imposed on her,nor will it prevent her from filing appropriate petitions for
an extraordinary writ. The order, however, will allow thisCourt to devote its limited resources to the claims of petitioners who have not abused our process. It is so ordered.

SUTTON et al. v. UNITED AIR LINES, INC.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe tenth circuit

No. 97-1943. Argued April 28, 1999--Decided June 22, 1999
Petitioners, severely myopic twin sisters, have uncorrected visual acuity

of 20/200 or worse, but with corrective measures, both function identically to individuals without similar impairments. They applied to
respondent, a major commercial airline carrier, for employment as commercial airline pilots but were rejected because they did not meet respondent's minimum requirement of uncorrected visual acuity of 20/100
or better. Consequently, they filed suit under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), which prohibits covered employers from
discriminating against individuals on the basis of their disabilities.
Among other things, the ADA defines a "disability" as "a physical or
mental impairment that substantially limits one or more . . . major life
activities," 42 U. S. C. $ 12102(2)(A), or as "being regarded as having
such an impairment," $ 12102(2)(C). The District Court dismissed petitioners' complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could
be granted. The court held that petitioners were not actually disabled
under subsection (A) of the disability definition because they could fully
correct their visual impairments. The court also determined that petitioners were not "regarded" by respondent as disabled under subsection (C) of this definition. Petitioners had alleged only that respondent
regarded them as unable to satisfy the requirements of a particular
job, global airline pilot. These allegations were insufficient to state a
claim that petitioners were regarded as substantially limited in the
major life activity of working. Employing similar logic, the Tenth Circuit affirmed.

Held: Petitioners have not alleged that they are "disabled" within the

ADA's meaning. Pp. 477-494.

(a) No agency has been delegated authority to interpret the term
"disability" as it is used in the ADA. The EEOC has, nevertheless,
issued regulations that, among other things, define "physical impairment" to mean "[a]ny physiological disorder . . . affecting . . . special
sense organs," "substantially limits" to mean "[u]nable to perform a
major life activity that the average person in the general population
can perform," and "[m]ajor [l]ife [a]ctivities [to] mea[n] functions such
as . . . working." Because both parties accept these regulations as
valid, and determining their validity is not necessary to decide this

527US2 Unit: $U84 [05-09-01 13:03:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN
472 SUTTON v. UNITED AIR LINES, INC.

Syllabus
case, the Court has no occasion to consider what deference they are
due, if any. The EEOC and the Justice Department have also issued
interpretive guidelines providing that the determination whether an individual is substantially limited in a major life activity must be made
on a case by case basis, without regard to mitigating measures such as
assistive or prosthetic devices. Although the parties dispute the guidelines' persuasive force, the Court has no need in this case to decide what
deference is due. Pp. 477-480.

(b) Petitioners have not stated a $ 12102(2)(A) claim that they have
an actual physical impairment that substantially limits them in one or
more major life activities. Three separate ADA provisions, read in
concert, lead to the conclusion that the determination whether an individual is disabled should be made with reference to measures, such
as eyeglasses and contact lenses, that mitigate the individual's impairment, and that the approach adopted by the agency guidelines is an
impermissible interpretation of the ADA. First, because the phrase
"substantially limits" appears in subsection (A) in the present indicative
verb form, the language is properly read as requiring that a person
be presently--not potentially or hypothetically--substantially limited in
order to demonstrate a disability. A "disability" exists only where an
impairment "substantially limits" a major life activity, not where it
"might," "could," or "would" be substantially limiting if corrective measures were not taken. Second, because subsection (A) requires that disabilities be evaluated "with respect to an individual" and be determined
based on whether an impairment substantially limits the individual's
"major life activities," the question whether a person has a disability
under the ADA is an individualized inquiry. See Bragdon v. Abbott,
524 U. S. 624, 641-642. The guidelines' directive that persons be judged
in their uncorrected or unmitigated state runs directly counter to this
mandated individualized inquiry. The former would create a system in
which persons would often be treated as members of a group having
similar impairments, rather than as individuals. It could also lead to
the anomalous result that courts and employers could not consider any
negative side effects suffered by the individual resulting from the use
of mitigating measures, even when those side effects are very severe.
Finally, and critically, the congressional finding that 43 million Americans have one or more physical or mental disabilities, see $ 12101(a)(1),
requires the conclusion that Congress did not intend to bring under
the ADA's protection all those whose uncorrected conditions amount to
disabilities. That group would include more than 160 million people.
Because petitioners allege that with corrective measures their vision is
20/20 or better, they are not actually disabled under subsection (A).
Pp. 481-489.

Syllabus
(c) Petitioners have also failed to allege properly that they are "regarded as," see $ 12102(2)(C), having an impairment that "substantially
limits" a major life activity, see $ 12102(2)(A). Generally, these claims
arise when an employer mistakenly believes that an individual has a
substantially limiting impairment. To support their claims, petitioners
allege that respondent has an impermissible vision requirement that
is based on myth and stereotype and that respondent mistakenly believes that, due to their poor vision, petitioners are unable to work as
"global airline pilots" and are thus substantially limited in the major life
activity of working. Creating physical criteria for a job, without more,
does not violate the ADA. The ADA allows employers to prefer some
physical attributes over others, so long as those attributes do not rise
to the level of substantially limiting impairments. An employer is free
to decide that physical characteristics or medical conditions that are
not impairments are preferable to others, just as it is free to decide
that some limiting, but not substantially limiting, impairments make
individuals less than ideally suited for a job. In addition, petitioners
have not sufficiently alleged that they are regarded as substantially limited in the major life activity of working. When the major life activity
under consideration is that of working, the ADA requires, at least, that
one's ability to work be significantly reduced. The EEOC regulations
similarly define "substantially limits" to mean significantly restricted
in the ability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs
in various classes as compared to the average person having comparable
training, skills and abilities. The Court assumes without deciding that
work is a major life activity and that this regulation is reasonable. It
observes, however, that defining "major life activities" to include work
has the potential to make the ADA circular. Assuming work is a major
life activity, the Court finds that petitioners' allegations are insufficient
because the position of global airline pilot is a single job. Indeed, a
number of other positions utilizing petitioners' skills, such as regional
pilot and pilot instructor, are available to them. The Court also rejects
petitioners' argument that they would be substantially limited in their
ability to work if it is assumed that a substantial number of airlines have
vision requirements similar to respondent's. This argument is flawed
because it is not enough to say that if the otherwise permissible physical
criteria or preferences of a single employer were imputed to all similar
employers one would be regarded as substantially limited in the major
life activity of working only as a result of this imputation. Rather, an
employer's physical criteria are permissible so long as they do not cause
the employer to make an employment decision based on an impairment, real or imagined, that it regards as substantially limiting a major

Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court.
The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA or Act),104 Stat. 328, 42 U. S. C. $ 12101

et seq., prohibits certain em-ployers from discriminating against individuals on the basis

of their disabilities. See $ 12112(a). Petitioners challengethe dismissal of their ADA action for failure to state a claim
upon which relief can be granted. We conclude that thecomplaint was properly dismissed. In reaching that result,
we hold that the determination of whether an individual isdisabled should be made with reference to measures that
mitigate the individual's impairment, including, in this in-stance, eyeglasses and contact lenses. In addition, we hold
that petitioners failed to allege properly that respondent"regarded" them as having a disability within the meaning
of the ADA. I

Petitioners' amended complaint was dismissed for failureto state a claim upon which relief could be granted. See
Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 12(b)(6). Accordingly, we accept theallegations contained in their complaint as true for purposes
of this case. See United States v. Gaubert, 499 U. S. 315,327 (1991).

Petitioners are twin sisters, both of whom have severemyopia. Each petitioner's uncorrected visual acuity is 20/
200 or worse in her right eye and 20/400 or worse in her lefteye, but "[w]ith the use of corrective lenses, each . . . has
vision that is 20/20 or better." App. 23. Consequently,without corrective lenses, each "effectively cannot see to conduct numerous activities such as driving a vehicle, watchingtelevision or shopping in public stores,"

id., at 24, but withcorrective measures, such as glasses or contact lenses, both

"function identically to individuals without a similar impair-ment,"

ibid.In 1992, petitioners applied to respondent for employment

as commercial airline pilots. They met respondent's basicage, education, experience, and Federal Aviation Adminis527US2 Unit: $U84 [05-09-01 13:03:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN

tration certification qualifications. After submitting theirapplications for employment, both petitioners were invited

by respondent to an interview and to flight simulator tests.Both were told during their interviews, however, that a mistake had been made in inviting them to interview because
petitioners did not meet respondent's minimum vision re-quirement, which was uncorrected visual acuity of 20/100 or

better. Due to their failure to meet this requirement, peti-tioners' interviews were terminated, and neither was offered
a pilot position.In light of respondent's proffered reason for rejecting
them, petitioners filed a charge of disability discrimination
under the ADA with the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC). After receiving a right to sue letter,
petitioners filed suit in the United States District Court for
the District of Colorado, alleging that respondent had discriminated against them "on the basis of their disability,
or because [respondent] regarded [petitioners] as having a
disability" in violation of the ADA. App. 26. Specifically,
petitioners alleged that due to their severe myopia they actually have a substantially limiting impairment or are regarded
as having such an impairment, see id., at 23-26, and are thus
disabled under the Act.

The District Court dismissed petitioners' complaint for
failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.
See Civ. A. No. 96-5-121 (Aug. 28, 1996), App. to Pet. for
Cert. A-27. Because petitioners could fully correct their
visual impairments, the court held that they were not actually substantially limited in any major life activity and thus
had not stated a claim that they were disabled within the
meaning of the ADA. Id., at A-32 to A-36. The court also
determined that petitioners had not made allegations sufficient to support their claim that they were "regarded" by
respondent as having an impairment that substantially limits
a major life activity. Id., at A-36 to A-37. The court observed that "[t]he statutory reference to a substantial limi527US2 Unit: $U84 [05-09-01 13:03:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
tation indicates . . . that an employer regards an employeeas handicapped in his or her ability to work by finding the

employee's impairment to foreclose generally the type ofemployment involved." Ibid. But petitioners had alleged
only that respondent regarded them as unable to satisfy therequirements of a particular job, global airline pilot. Consequently, the court held that petitioners had not stated a claimthat they were regarded as substantially limited in the major
life activity of working. Employing similar logic, the Courtof Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed the District Court's
judgment. 130 F. 3d 893 (1997).The Tenth Circuit's decision is in tension with the decisions of other Courts of Appeals. See, e. g., Bartlett v.New York State Bd. of Law Examiners, 156 F. 3d 321, 329
(CA2 1998) (holding self-accommodations cannot be consid-ered when determining a disability), cert. pending, No. 98-
1285; Baert v. Euclid Beverage, Ltd., 149 F. 3d 626, 629-630(CA7 1998) (holding disabilities should be determined without reference to mitigating measures); Matczak v. Frankford

1998) (holding that only some impairments should be evalu-ated in their uncorrected state), cert. pending, No. 98-1365.
We granted certiorari, 525 U. S. 1063 (1999), and now affirm.

The ADA prohibits discrimination by covered entities,including private employers, against qualified individuals

with a disability. Specifically, it provides that no coveredemployer "shall discriminate against a qualified individual
with a disability because of the disability of such individualin regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation,job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges

of employment." 42 U. S. C. $ 12112(a); see also $ 12111(2)
("The term `covered entity' means an employer, employment
agency, labor organization, or joint labor-management committee"). A "qualified individual with a disability" is identified as "an individual with a disability who, with or without
reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds
or desires." $ 12111(8). In turn, a "disability" is defined as:

"(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of
such individual;

"(B) a record of such an impairment; or
"(C) being regarded as having such an impairment."

$ 12102(2).

Accordingly, to fall within this definition one must have an
actual disability (subsection (A)), have a record of a disability (subsection (B)), or be regarded as having one (subsection (C)).

The parties agree that the authority to issue regulations
to implement the Act is split primarily among three Government agencies. According to the parties, the EEOC has
authority to issue regulations to carry out the employment
provisions in Title I of the ADA, $$ 12111-12117, pursuant to

$ 12116 ("Not later than 1 year after [the date of enactment
of this Act], the Commission shall issue regulations in an
accessible format to carry out this subchapter in accordance
with subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5"). The Attorney
General is granted authority to issue regulations with respect to Title II, subtitle A, $$ 12131-12134, which relates
to public services. See $ 12134 ("Not later than 1 year after
[the date of enactment of this Act], the Attorney General
shall promulgate regulations in an accessible format that
implement this part"). Finally, the Secretary of Transportation has authority to issue regulations pertaining to the
transportation provisions of Titles II and III. See $ 12149(a)

Opinion of the Court
("Not later than 1 year after [the date of enactment of thisAct], the Secretary of Transportation shall issue regulations, in an accessible format, necessary for carrying out thissubpart (other than section 12143 of this title)"); $ 12164 (substantially same); $ 12186(a)(1) (substantially same); $ 12143(b)

out this section"). See also $ 12204 (granting authority tothe Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance
Board to issue minimum guidelines to supplement the exist-ing Minimum Guidelines and Requirements for Accessible
Design). Moreover, each of these agencies is authorized to
offer technical assistance regarding the provisions they administer. See $ 12206(c)(1) ("Each Federal agency that has
responsibility under paragraph (2) for implementing this
chapter may render technical assistance to individuals and
institutions that have rights or duties under the respective
subchapter or subchapters of this chapter for which such
agency has responsibility").

No agency, however, has been given authority to issue
regulations implementing the generally applicable provisions
of the ADA, see $$ 12101-12102, which fall outside Titles
I-V. Most notably, no agency has been delegated authority to interpret the term "disability." $ 12102(2). Justice
Breyer's contrary, imaginative interpretation of the Act's
delegation provisions, see post, at 514-515 (dissenting opinion), is belied by the terms and structure of the ADA. The
EEOC has, nonetheless, issued regulations to provide additional guidance regarding the proper interpretation of

this term. After restating the definition of disability given
in the statute, see 29 CFR $ 1630.2(g) (1998), the EEOC
regulations define the three elements of disability: (1) "physical or mental impairment," (2) "substantially limits,"
and (3) "major life activities." See $$ 1630.2(h)-( j). Under
the regulations, a "physical impairment" includes "[a]ny
physiological disorder, or condition, cosmetic disfigurement,

or anatomical loss affecting one or more of the following bodysystems: neurological, musculoskeletal, special sense organs,

respiratory (including speech organs), cardiovascular, repro-ductive, digestive, genito-urinary, hemic and lymphatic, skin,
and endocrine." $ 1630.2(h)(1). The term "substantially
limits" means, among other things, "[u]nable to perform amajor life activity that the average person in the general

population can perform"; or "[s]ignificantly restricted as tothe condition, manner or duration under which an individual
can perform a particular major life activity as compared tothe condition, manner, or duration under which the average
person in the general population can perform that same
major life activity." $ 1630.2( j). Finally, "[m]ajor [l]ife [a]ctivities means functions such as caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, and working. " $ 1630.2(i). Because both
parties accept these regulations as valid, and determining
their validity is not necessary to decide this case, we have
no occasion to consider what deference they are due, if any.

The agencies have also issued interpretive guidelines to
aid in the implementation of their regulations. For instance, at the time that it promulgated the above regulations, the EEOC issued an "Interpretive Guidance," which
provides that "[t]he determination of whether an individual is substantially limited in a major life activity must be
made on a case by case basis, without regard to mitigating
measures such as medicines, or assistive or prosthetic devices." 29 CFR pt. 1630, App. $ 1630.2( j) (1998) (describing

$ 1630.2( j)). The Department of Justice has issued a similar
guideline. See 28 CFR pt. 35, App. A, $ 35.104 ("The question of whether a person has a disability should be assessed
without regard to the availability of mitigating measures,
such as reasonable modification or auxiliary aids and services"); pt. 36, App. B, $ 36.104 (same). Although the parties
dispute the persuasive force of these interpretive guidelines,
we have no need in this case to decide what deference is due.

Opinion of the Court

III
With this statutory and regulatory framework in mind,we turn first to the question whether petitioners have

stated a claim under subsection (A) of the disability defi-nition, that is, whether they have alleged that they possess
a physical impairment that substantially limits them in oneor more major life activities. See 42 U. S. C. $ 12102(2)(A).
Because petitioners allege that with corrective measurestheir vision "is 20/20 or better," App. 23, they are not actually disabled within the meaning of the Act if the "dis-ability" determination is made with reference to these measures. Consequently, with respect to subsection (A) of thedisability definition, our decision turns on whether disability
is to be determined with or without reference to correctivemeasures.

Petitioners maintain that whether an impairment is sub-stantially limiting should be determined without regard to
corrective measures. They argue that, because the ADAdoes not directly address the question at hand, the Court
should defer to the agency interpretations of the statute,which are embodied in the agency guidelines issued by the
EEOC and the Department of Justice. These guidelinesspecifically direct that the determination of whether an individual is substantially limited in a major life activity bemade without regard to mitigating measures. See 29 CFR
pt. 1630, App. $ 1630.2( j); 28 CFR pt. 35, App. A $ 35.104(1998); 28 CFR pt. 36, App. B $ 36.104.

Respondent, in turn, maintains that an impairment doesnot substantially limit a major life activity if it is corrected.
It argues that the Court should not defer to the agencyguidelines cited by petitioners because the guidelines conflict
with the plain meaning of the ADA. The phrase "substan-tially limits one or more major life activities," it explains,
requires that the substantial limitations actually and pres-ently exist. Moreover, respondent argues, disregarding
mitigating measures taken by an individual defies the statu527US2 Unit: $U84 [05-09-01 13:03:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN
482 SUTTON v. UNITED AIR LINES, INC.

Opinion of the Court
tory command to examine the effect of the impairment onthe major life activities "of such individual." And even if

the statute is ambiguous, respondent claims, the guidelines'directive to ignore mitigating measures is not reasonable,
and thus this Court should not defer to it.

We conclude that respondent is correct that the approachadopted by the agency guidelines--that persons are to be

evaluated in their hypothetical uncorrected state--is an im-permissible interpretation of the ADA. Looking at the Act
as a whole, it is apparent that if a person is taking measuresto correct for, or mitigate, a physical or mental impairment,
the effects of those measures--both positive and negative--
must be taken into account when judging whether that person is "substantially limited" in a major life activity and thus
"disabled" under the Act. Justice Stevens relies on the
legislative history of the ADA for the contrary proposition
that individuals should be examined in their uncorrected
state. See post, at 499-501 (dissenting opinion). Because
we decide that, by its terms, the ADA cannot be read in this
manner, we have no reason to consider the ADA's legislative history.

Three separate provisions of the ADA, read in concert,
lead us to this conclusion. The Act defines a "disability" as
"a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits
one or more of the major life activities" of an individual.

$ 12102(2)(A) (emphasis added). Because the phrase "substantially limits" appears in the Act in the present indicative verb form, we think the language is properly read as
requiring that a person be presently--not potentially or hypothetically--substantially limited in order to demonstrate a
disability. A "disability" exists only where an impairment
"substantially limits" a major life activity, not where it
"might," "could," or "would" be substantially limiting if mitigating measures were not taken. A person whose physical
or mental impairment is corrected by medication or other
measures does not have an impairment that presently "sub527US2 Unit: $U84 [05-09-01 13:03:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN

483Cite as: 527 U. S. 471 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
stantially limits" a major life activity. To be sure, a personwhose physical or mental impairment is corrected by mitigating measures still has an impairment, but if the impair-ment is corrected it does not "substantially limi[t]" a major
life activity.

The definition of disability also requires that disabilitiesbe evaluated "with respect to an individual" and be determined based on whether an impairment substantially limitsthe "major life activities of such individual." $ 12102(2).
Thus, whether a person has a disability under the ADA is anindividualized inquiry. See

Bragdon v. Abbott, 524 U. S.
624, 641-642 (1998) (declining to consider whether HIV infection is a per se disability under the ADA); 29 CFR
pt. 1630, App. $ 1630.2( j) ("The determination of whether
an individual has a disability is not necessarily based on
the name or diagnosis of the impairment the person has,
but rather on the effect of that impairment on the life of
the individual").

The agency guidelines' directive that persons be judged in
their uncorrected or unmitigated state runs directly counter
to the individualized inquiry mandated by the ADA. The
agency approach would often require courts and employers
to speculate about a person's condition and would, in many
cases, force them to make a disability determination based
on general information about how an uncorrected impairment usually affects individuals, rather than on the individual's actual condition. For instance, under this view, courts
would almost certainly find all diabetics to be disabled, because if they failed to monitor their blood sugar levels and
administer insulin, they would almost certainly be substantially limited in one or more major life activities. A diabetic
whose illness does not impair his or her daily activities would
therefore be considered disabled simply because he or she
has diabetes. Thus, the guidelines approach would create a
system in which persons often must be treated as members
of a group of people with similar impairments, rather than

527US2 Unit: $U84 [05-09-01 13:03:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN
484 SUTTON v. UNITED AIR LINES, INC.

Opinion of the Court
as individuals. This is contrary to both the letter and thespirit of the ADA.

The guidelines approach could also lead to the anomalousresult that in determining whether an individual is disabled,
courts and employers could not consider any negative side
effects suffered by an individual resulting from the use ofmitigating measures, even when those side effects are very

severe. See, e. g., Johnson, Antipsychotics: Pros and Consof Antipsychotics, RN (Aug. 1997) (noting that antipsychotic
drugs can cause a variety of adverse effects, including neuro-leptic malignant syndrome and painful seizures); Liver Risk
Warning Added to Parkinson's Drug, FDA Consumer (Mar.
1, 1999) (warning that a drug for treating Parkinson's disease
can cause liver damage); Curry & Kulling, Newer Antiepileptic Drugs, American Family Physician (Feb. 1, 1998) (cataloging serious negative side effects of new antiepileptic drugs).
This result is also inconsistent with the individualized approach of the ADA.

Finally, and critically, findings enacted as part of the ADA
require the conclusion that Congress did not intend to bring
under the statute's protection all those whose uncorrected
conditions amount to disabilities. Congress found that
"some 43,000,000 Americans have one or more physical or
mental disabilities, and this number is increasing as the population as a whole is growing older." $ 12101(a)(1). This
figure is inconsistent with the definition of disability pressed
by petitioners.

Although the exact source of the 43 million figure is not
clear, the corresponding finding in the 1988 precursor to the
ADA was drawn directly from a report prepared by the National Council on Disability. See Burgdorf, The Americans
with Disabilities Act: Analysis and Implications of a SecondGeneration Civil Rights Statute, 26 Harv. Civ. Rights-Civ.
Lib. L. Rev. 413, 434, n. 117 (1991) (reporting, in an article
authored by the drafter of the original ADA bill introduced
in Congress in 1988, that the report was the source for a

Opinion of the Court
figure of 36 million disabled persons quoted in the versionsof the bill introduced in 1988). That report detailed the

difficulty of estimating the number of disabled persons dueto varying operational definitions of disability. National
Council on Disability, Toward Independence 10 (1986). It
explained that the estimates of the number of disabledAmericans ranged from an overinclusive 160 million under a

"health conditions approach," which looks at all conditionsthat impair the health or normal functional abilities of an
individual, to an underinclusive 22.7 million under a "workdisability approach," which focuses on individuals' reported
ability to work. Id., at 10-11. It noted that "a figure of
35 or 36 million [was] the most commonly quoted estimate."
Id., at 10. The 36 million number included in the 1988 bill's
findings thus clearly reflects an approach to defining disabilities that is closer to the work disabilities approach than the
health conditions approach.

This background also provides some clues to the likely
source of the figure in the findings of the 1990 Act. Roughly
two years after issuing its 1986 report, the National Council
on Disability issued an updated report. See On the Threshold of Independence (1988). This 1988 report settled on a
more concrete definition of disability. It stated that 37.3
million individuals have "difficulty performing one or more
basic physical activities," including "seeing, hearing, speaking, walking, using stairs, lifting or carrying, getting around
outside, getting around inside, and getting into or out of
bed." Id., at 19. The study from which it drew this data
took an explicitly functional approach to evaluating disabilities. See U. S. Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Census,
Disability, Functional Limitation, and Health Insurance
Coverage: 1984/85, p. 2 (1986). It measured 37.3 million persons with a "functional limitation" on performing certain
basic activities when using, as the questionnaire put it,
"special aids," such as glasses or hearing aids, if the person
usually used such aids. Id., at 1, 47. The number of dis527US2 Unit: $U84 [05-09-01 13:03:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN
486 SUTTON v. UNITED AIR LINES, INC.

Opinion of the Court
abled provided by the study and adopted in the 1988 report,however, includes only noninstitutionalized persons with

physical disabilities who are over age 15. The 5.7 milliongap between the 43 million figure in the ADA's findings and
the 37.3 million figure in the report can thus probably be
explained as an effort to include in the findings those whowere excluded from the National Council figure. See,

e. g.,
National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Re-search, Data on Disability from the National Health Interview Survey 1983-1985, pp. 61-62 (1988) (finding approxi-mately 943,000 noninstitutionalized persons with an activity
limitation due to mental illness; 947,000 noninstitutionalized
persons with an activity limitation due to mental retardation; 1,900,000 noninstitutionalized persons under 18 with an
activity limitation); U. S. Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of the
Census, Statistical Abstract of the United States 106 (1989)
(Table 168) (finding 1,553,000 resident patients in nursing
and related care facilities (excluding hospital-based nursing
homes) in 1986).

Regardless of its exact source, however, the 43 million
figure reflects an understanding that those whose impairments are largely corrected by medication or other devices
are not "disabled" within the meaning of the ADA. The estimate is consistent with the numbers produced by studies
performed during this same time period that took a similar
functional approach to determining disability. For instance,
Mathematica Policy Research, Inc., drawing on data from
the National Center for Health Statistics, issued an estimate
of approximately 31.4 million civilian noninstitutionalized
persons with "chronic activity limitation status" in 1979.
Digest of Data on Persons with Disabilities 25 (1984). The
1989 Statistical Abstract offered the same estimate based
on the same data, as well as an estimate of 32.7 million noninstitutionalized persons with "activity limitation" in 1985.
Statistical Abstract, supra, at 115 (Table 184). In both
cases, individuals with "activity limitations" were those who,

Opinion of the Court
relative to their age-sex group could not conduct "usual" ac-tivities:

e. g., attending preschool, keeping house, or living
independently. See National Center for Health Statistics,U. S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, Vital and Health

Statistics, Current Estimates from the National Health Interview Survey, 1989, Series 10, pp. 7-8 (1990).By contrast, nonfunctional approaches to defining disability produce significantly larger numbers. As noted above,the 1986 National Council on Disability report estimated that
there were over 160 million disabled under the "health condi-tions approach." Toward Independence,

supra, at 10; see
also Mathematica Policy Research, supra, at 3 (arriving at
similar estimate based on same Census Bureau data). Indeed, the number of people with vision impairments alone is
100 million. See National Advisory Eye Council, U. S. Dept.
of Health and Human Services, Vision Research--A National
Plan: 1999-2003, p. 7 (1998) ("[M]ore than 100 million people
need corrective lenses to see properly"). "It is estimated
that more than 28 million Americans have impaired hearing."
National Institutes of Health, National Strategic Research
Plan: Hearing and Hearing Impairment v (1996). And there
were approximately 50 million people with high blood pressure (hypertension). Tindall, Stalking a Silent Killer; Hypertension, Business & Health 37 (August 1998) ("Some 50
million Americans have high blood pressure").

Because it is included in the ADA's text, the finding that
43 million individuals are disabled gives content to the ADA's
terms, specifically the term "disability." Had Congress intended to include all persons with corrected physical limitations among those covered by the Act, it undoubtedly would
have cited a much higher number of disabled persons in the
findings. That it did not is evidence that the ADA's coverage is restricted to only those whose impairments are not
mitigated by corrective measures.

The dissents suggest that viewing individuals in their corrected state will exclude from the definition of "disab[led]"

488 SUTTON v. UNITED AIR LINES, INC.

Opinion of the Court
those who use prosthetic limbs, see post, at 497-498 (opinion
of Stevens, J.), post, at 513 (opinion of Breyer, J.), or take
medicine for epilepsy or high blood pressure, see post, at 507,

509 (opinion of Stevens, J.). This suggestion is incorrect.
The use of a corrective device does not, by itself, relieve one's
disability. Rather, one has a disability under subsection (A)
if, notwithstanding the use of a corrective device, that individual is substantially limited in a major life activity. For
example, individuals who use prosthetic limbs or wheelchairs
may be mobile and capable of functioning in society but still
be disabled because of a substantial limitation on their ability
to walk or run. The same may be true of individuals who
take medicine to lessen the symptoms of an impairment so
that they can function but nevertheless remain substantially
limited. Alternatively, one whose high blood pressure is
"cured" by medication may be regarded as disabled by a covered entity, and thus disabled under subsection (C) of the
definition. The use or nonuse of a corrective device does
not determine whether an individual is disabled; that determination depends on whether the limitations an individual
with an impairment actually faces are in fact substantially
limiting.

Applying this reading of the Act to the case at hand, we
conclude that the Court of Appeals correctly resolved the
issue of disability in respondent's favor. As noted above,
petitioners allege that with corrective measures, their visual
acuity is 20/20, App. 23, Amended Complaint || 36, and that

use of corrective lenses in itself demonstrates a substantially
limiting impairment." Brief for Petitioners 9, n. 11. Accordingly, because we decide that disability under the Act is
to be determined with reference to corrective measures, we
agree with the courts below that petitioners have not stated

Opinion of the Court
a claim that they are substantially limited in any major lifeactivity.

IV
Our conclusion that petitioners have failed to state a claimthat they are actually disabled under subsection (A) of the

disability definition does not end our inquiry. Under sub-section (C), individuals who are "regarded as" having a disability are disabled within the meaning of the ADA. See$ 12102(2)(C). Subsection (C) provides that having a disability includes "being regarded as having," $ 12102(2)(C),"a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits
one or more of the major life activities of such individual,"$ 12102(2)(A). There are two apparent ways in which individuals may fall within this statutory definition: (1) a coveredentity mistakenly believes that a person has a physical impairment that substantially limits one or more major lifeactivities, or (2) a covered entity mistakenly believes that
an actual, nonlimiting impairment substantially limits oneor more major life activities. In both cases, it is necessary
that a covered entity entertain misperceptions about theindividual--it must believe either that one has a substantially limiting impairment that one does not have or that onehas a substantially limiting impairment when, in fact, the
impairment is not so limiting. These misperceptions often"resul[t] from stereotypic assumptions not truly indicative
of . . . individual ability." See 42 U. S. C. $ 12101(7). Seealso School Bd. of Nassau Cty. v. Arline, 480 U. S. 273, 284
(1987) ("By amending the definition of `handicapped individ-ual' to include not only those who are actually physically impaired, but also those who are regarded as impaired and who,as a result, are substantially limited in a major life activity,
Congress acknowledged that society's accumulated mythsand fears about disability and disease are as handicapping as
are the physical limitations that flow from actual impair-ment"); 29 CFR pt. 1630, App. $ 1630.2(l) (explaining that the
purpose of the regarded as prong is to cover individuals "re527US2 Unit: $U84 [05-09-01 13:03:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
jected from a job because of the `myths, fears and stereo-types' associated with disabilities").

There is no dispute that petitioners are physically im-paired. Petitioners do not make the obvious argument that
they are regarded due to their impairments as substantially
limited in the major life activity of seeing. They contendonly that respondent mistakenly believes their physical impairments substantially limit them in the major life activityof working. To support this claim, petitioners allege that
respondent has a vision requirement that is allegedly basedon myth and stereotype. Further, this requirement substantially limits their ability to engage in the major life activity of working by precluding them from obtaining the job
of global airline pilot, which they argue is a "class of employment." See App. 24-26, Amended Complaint || 38. In
reply, respondent argues that the position of global airline
pilot is not a class of jobs and therefore petitioners have not
stated a claim that they are regarded as substantially limited
in the major life activity of working.

Standing alone, the allegation that respondent has a vision
requirement in place does not establish a claim that respondent regards petitioners as substantially limited in the major
life activity of working. See Post-Argument Brief for
Respondent 2-3 (advancing this argument); Post-Argument
Brief for United States et al. as Amici Curiae 5-6 ("[U]nder
the EEOC's regulations, an employer may make employment
decisions based on physical characteristics"). By its terms,
the ADA allows employers to prefer some physical attributes
over others and to establish physical criteria. An employer
runs afoul of the ADA when it makes an employment decision based on a physical or mental impairment, real or
imagined, that is regarded as substantially limiting a major
life activity. Accordingly, an employer is free to decide that
physical characteristics or medical conditions that do not rise
to the level of an impairment--such as one's height, build, or
singing voice--are preferable to others, just as it is free to

Opinion of the Court
decide that some limiting, but not substantially limiting, im-pairments make individuals less than ideally suited for a job.

Considering the allegations of the amended complaint intandem, petitioners have not stated a claim that respondent
regards their impairment as substantially limiting their
ability to work. The ADA does not define "substantiallylimits," but "substantially" suggests "considerable" or "specified to a large degree." See Webster's Third New Inter-national Dictionary 2280 (1976) (defining "substantially" as
"in a substantial manner" and "substantial" as "considerablein amount, value, or worth" and "being that specified to a
large degree or in the main"); see also 17 Oxford EnglishDictionary 66-67 (2d ed. 1989) ("substantial": "[r]elating to
or proceeding from the essence of a thing; essential"; "of
ample or considerable amount, quantity or dimensions").The EEOC has codified regulations interpreting the term

"substantially limits" in this manner, defining the term tomean "[u]nable to perform" or "[s]ignificantly restricted."
See 29 CFR $$ 1630.2( j)(1)(i), (ii) (1998).When the major life activity under consideration is that
of working, the statutory phrase "substantially limits" re-quires, at a minimum, that plaintiffs allege they are unable
to work in a broad class of jobs. Reflecting this requirement, the EEOC uses a specialized definition of the term"substantially limits" when referring to the major life activity of working:

"significantly restricted in the ability to perform either
a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classesas compared to the average person having comparable

training, skills and abilities. The inability to perform
a single, particular job does not constitute a substantial limitation in the major life activity of working."

$ 1630.2( j)(3)(i).

The EEOC further identifies several factors that courts
should consider when determining whether an individual is

527US2 Unit: $U84 [05-09-01 13:03:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN
492 SUTTON v. UNITED AIR LINES, INC.

Opinion of the Court
substantially limited in the major life activity of working,including the geographical area to which the individual has

reasonable access, and "the number and types of jobs utiliz-ing similar training, knowledge, skills or abilities, within the
geographical area, from which the individual is also disqualified." $$ 1630.2( j)(3)(ii)(A), (B). To be substantially limitedin the major life activity of working, then, one must be precluded from more than one type of job, a specialized job, ora particular job of choice. If jobs utilizing an individual's
skills (but perhaps not his or her unique talents) are avail-able, one is not precluded from a substantial class of jobs.
Similarly, if a host of different types of jobs are available,
one is not precluded from a broad range of jobs.

Because the parties accept that the term "major life activities" includes working, we do not determine the validity of
the cited regulations. We note, however, that there may be
some conceptual difficulty in defining "major life activities"
to include work, for it seems "to argue in a circle to say that
if one is excluded, for instance, by reason of [an impairment, from working with others] . . . then that exclusion constitutes an impairment, when the question you're asking is,
whether the exclusion itself is by reason of handicap." Tr. of
Oral Arg. in School Bd. of Nassau Co. v. Arline, O. T. 1986,
No. 85-1277, p. 15 (argument of Solicitor General). Indeed,
even the EEOC has expressed reluctance to define "major
life activities" to include working and has suggested that
working be viewed as a residual life activity, considered, as
a last resort, only "[i]f an individual is not substantially limited with respect to any other major life activity." 29 CFR
pt. 1630, App. $ 1630.2( j) (1998) (emphasis added) ("If an individual is substantially limited in any other major life activity,
no determination should be made as to whether the individual is substantially limited in working" (emphasis added)).

Assuming without deciding that working is a major life
activity and that the EEOC regulations interpreting the
term "substantially limits" are reasonable, petitioners have

Opinion of the Court
failed to allege adequately that their poor eyesight is re-garded as an impairment that substantially limits them in

the major life activity of working. They allege only thatrespondent regards their poor vision as precluding them
from holding positions as a "global airline pilot." See App.
25-26, Amended Complaint || 38f. Because the position ofglobal airline pilot is a single job, this allegation does not

support the claim that respondent regards petitioners ashaving a

substantially limiting impairment. See 29 CFR

$ 1630.2( j)(3)(i) (1998) ("The inability to perform a single,particular job does not constitute a substantial limitation in

the major life activity of working"). Indeed, there are a
number of other positions utilizing petitioners' skills, such as
regional pilot and pilot instructor to name a few, that are
available to them. Even under the EEOC's Interpretative
Guidance, to which petitioners ask us to defer, "an individual
who cannot be a commercial airline pilot because of a minor
vision impairment, but who can be a commercial airline copilot or a pilot for a courier service, would not be substantially limited in the major life activity of working." 29 CFR
pt. 1630, App. $ 1630.2 (1998).

Petitioners also argue that if one were to assume that a
substantial number of airline carriers have similar vision requirements, they would be substantially limited in the major
life activity of working. See Brief for Petitioners 44-45.
Even assuming for the sake of argument that the adoption
of similar vision requirements by other carriers would represent a substantial limitation on the major life activity of
working, the argument is nevertheless flawed. It is not
enough to say that if the physical criteria of a single employer were imputed to all similar employers one would be
regarded as substantially limited in the major life activity of
working only as a result of this imputation. An otherwise
valid job requirement, such as a height requirement, does
not become invalid simply because it would limit a person's
employment opportunities in a substantial way if it were

respondent's vision requirement reflects a belief that peti-tioners' vision substantially limits them, we agree with the
decision of the Court of Appeals affirming the dismissal of
petitioners' claim that they are regarded as disabled.For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals

for the Tenth Circuit is affirmed.

It is so ordered.

Justice Ginsburg, concurring.
I agree that 42 U. S. C. $ 12102(2)(A) does not reach thelegions of people with correctable disabilities. The strongest clues to Congress' perception of the domain of the Ameri-cans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), as I see it, are
legislative findings that "some 43,000,000 Americans have
one or more physical or mental disabilities," $ 12101(a)(1),
and that "individuals with disabilities are a discrete and
insular minority," persons "subjected to a history of purposeful unequal treatment, and relegated to a position of
political powerlessness in our society," $ 12101(a)(7). These
declarations are inconsistent with the enormously embracing
definition of disability petitioners urge. As the Court demonstrates, see ante, at 483-487, the inclusion of correctable
disabilities within the ADA's domain would extend the Act's
coverage to far more than 43 million people. And persons
whose uncorrected eyesight is poor, or who rely on daily
medication for their well-being, can be found in every social
and economic class; they do not cluster among the politically
powerless, nor do they coalesce as historical victims of discrimination. In short, in no sensible way can one rank the
large numbers of diverse individuals with corrected disabilities as a "discrete and insular minority." I do not mean
to suggest that any of the constitutional presumptions or
doctrines that may apply to "discrete and insular" minorities in other contexts are relevant here; there is no con527US2 Unit: $U84 [05-09-01 13:03:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN

stitutional dimension to this case. Congress' use of the
phrase, however, is a telling indication of its intent to restrict the ADA's coverage to a confined, and historically disadvantaged, class.

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Breyer joins,
dissenting.

When it enacted the Americans with Disabilities Act of
1990 (ADA or Act), Congress certainly did not intend to require United Air Lines to hire unsafe or unqualified pilots.
Nor, in all likelihood, did it view every person who wears
glasses as a member of a "discrete and insular minority."
Indeed, by reason of legislative myopia it may not have foreseen that its definition of "disability" might theoretically encompass, not just "some 43,000,000 Americans," 42 U. S. C.

$ 12101(a)(1), but perhaps two or three times that number.
Nevertheless, if we apply customary tools of statutory construction, it is quite clear that the threshold question
whether an individual is "disabled" within the meaning of
the Act--and, therefore, is entitled to the basic assurances
that the Act affords--focuses on her past or present physical condition without regard to mitigation that has resulted
from rehabilitation, self-improvement, prosthetic devices,
or medication. One might reasonably argue that the general rule should not apply to an impairment that merely requires a nearsighted person to wear glasses. But I believe
that, in order to be faithful to the remedial purpose of the
Act, we should give it a generous, rather than a miserly,
construction.

There are really two parts to the question of statutory
construction presented by this case. The first question is
whether the determination of disability for people that Congress unquestionably intended to cover should focus on their
unmitigated or their mitigated condition. If the correct answer to that question is the one provided by eight of the

nine Federal Courts of Appeals to address the issue,1 andby all three of the Executive agencies that have issued regulations or interpretive bulletins construing the statute--namely, that the statute defines "disability" without regard
to ameliorative measures--it would still be necessary to de-cide whether that general rule should be applied to what
might be characterized as a "minor, trivial impairment."

expressly provided that the "purpose of [the ADA is] to pro-vide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the

elimination of discrimination against individuals with dis-abilities." 42 U. S. C. $ 12101(b)(1). To that end, the ADA
prohibits covered employers from "discriminat[ing] against
a qualified individual with a disability because of the dis-ability" in regard to the terms, conditions, and privileges

of employment. 42 U. S. C. $ 12112(a) (emphasis added).The Act's definition of disability is drawn "almost verbatim"
from the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U. S. C. $ 706(8)(B).
Bragdon v. Abbott, 524 U. S. 624, 631 (1998). The ADA's
definition provides:

"The term `disability' means, with respect to an
individual--"(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities ofsuch individual;

"(B) a record of such an impairment; or
"(C) being regarded as having such an impairment."42 U. S. C. $ 12102(2).

The three parts of this definition do not identify mutually
exclusive, discrete categories. On the contrary, they furnishthree overlapping formulas aimed at ensuring that individuals who now have, or ever had, a substantially limiting
impairment are covered by the Act.An example of a rather common condition illustrates this

point: There are many individuals who have lost one or morelimbs in industrial accidents, or perhaps in the service of
their country in places like Iwo Jima. With the aid of prostheses, coupled with courageous determination and physical
therapy, many of these hardy individuals can perform all
of their major life activities just as efficiently as an average
couch potato. If the Act were just concerned with their
present ability to participate in society, many of these individuals' physical impairments would not be viewed as dis527US2 Unit: $U84 [05-09-01 13:03:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Stevens, J., dissenting
abilities. Similarly, if the statute were solely concernedwith whether these individuals viewed themselves as disabled--or with whether a majority of employers regardedthem as unable to perform most jobs--many of these individuals would lack statutory protection from discrimination
based on their prostheses.The sweep of the statute's three-pronged definition, however, makes it pellucidly clear that Congress intended theAct to cover such persons. The fact that a prosthetic device,
such as an artificial leg, has restored one's ability to performmajor life activities surely cannot mean that subsection (A)
of the definition is inapplicable. Nor should the fact that
the individual considers himself (or actually is) "cured," or
that a prospective employer considers him generally employable, mean that subsections (B) or (C) are inapplicable.
But under the Court's emphasis on "the present indicative
verb form" used in subsection (A), ante, at 482, that subsection presumably would not apply. And under the Court's
focus on the individual's "presen[t]--not potentia[l] or hypothetica[l]"--condition, ibid., and on whether a person is "precluded from a broad range of jobs," ante, at 492, subsections
(B) and (C) presumably would not apply.

In my view, when an employer refuses to hire the individual "because of " his prosthesis, and the prosthesis in no
way affects his ability to do the job, that employer has unquestionably discriminated against the individual in violation of the Act. Subsection (B) of the definition, in fact,
sheds a revelatory light on the question whether Congress
was concerned only about the corrected or mitigated status
of a person's impairment. If the Court is correct that "[a]
`disability' exists only where" a person's "present" or "actual" condition is substantially impaired, ante, at 482, there
would be no reason to include in the protected class those
who were once disabled but who are now fully recovered.
Subsection (B) of the Act's definition, however, plainly covers a person who previously had a serious hearing impair527US2 Unit: $U84 [05-09-01 13:03:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Stevens, J., dissenting
ment that has since been completely cured. See School Bd.
of Nassau Cty. v. Arline, 480 U. S. 273, 281 (1987). Still, if
I correctly understand the Court's opinion, it holds that one
who continues to wear a hearing aid that she has worn all
her life might not be covered--fully cured impairments are
covered, but merely treatable ones are not. The text of the
Act surely does not require such a bizarre result.

The three prongs of the statute, rather, are most plausibly
read together not to inquire into whether a person is currently "functionally" limited in a major life activity, but only
into the existence of an impairment--present or past--that
substantially limits, or did so limit, the individual before
amelioration. This reading avoids the counterintuitive conclusion that the ADA's safeguards vanish when individuals
make themselves more employable by ascertaining ways to
overcome their physical or mental limitations.

To the extent that there may be doubt concerning the
meaning of the statutory text, ambiguity is easily removed
by looking at the legislative history. As then-Justice
Rehnquist stated for the Court in Garcia v. United States,
469 U. S. 70 (1984): "In surveying legislative history we have
repeatedly stated that the authoritative source for finding
the Legislature's intent lies in the Committee Reports on
the bill, which `represen[t] the considered and collective
understanding of those Congressmen involved in drafting
and studying the proposed legislation.' " Id., at 76 (quoting
Zuber v. Allen, 396 U. S. 168, 186 (1969)). The Committee
Reports on the bill that became the ADA make it abundantly
clear that Congress intended the ADA to cover individuals
who could perform all of their major life activities only with
the help of ameliorative measures.

The ADA originated in the Senate. The Senate Report
states that "whether a person has a disability should be assessed without regard to the availability of mitigating measures, such as reasonable accommodations or auxiliary aids."

Stevens, J., dissenting
S. Rep. No. 101-116, p. 23 (1989). The Report furtherexplained, in discussing the "regarded as" prong:

"[An] important goal of the third prong of the [dis-ability] definition is to ensure that persons with medical
conditions that are under control, and that therefore donot currently limit major life activities, are not discriminated against on the basis of their medical conditions.For example, individuals with controlled diabetes or
epilepsy are often denied jobs for which they are quali-fied. Such denials are the result of negative attitudes
and misinformation." Id., at 24.
When the legislation was considered in the House of Rep-resentatives, its Committees reiterated the Senate's basic

understanding of the Act's coverage, with one minor modi-fication: They clarified that "correctable" or "controllable"
disabilities were covered in the first definitional prong aswell. The Report of the House Committee on the Judiciary
states, in discussing the first prong, that, when determiningwhether an individual's impairment substantially limits a
major life activity, "[t]he impairment should be assessedwithout considering whether mitigating measures, such as
auxiliary aids or reasonable accommodations, would resultin a less-than-substantial limitation." H. R. Rep. No. 101-
485, pt. III, p. 28 (1990). The Report continues that "a per-son with epilepsy, an impairment which substantially limits
a major life activity, is covered under this test," ibid., asis a person with poor hearing, "even if the hearing loss is
corrected by the use of a hearing aid," id., at 29.The Report of the House Committee on Education and

Labor likewise states that "[w]hether a person has a dis-ability should be assessed without regard to the availability
of mitigating measures, such as reasonable accommodationsor auxiliary aids." Id., pt. II, at 52. To make matters perfectly plain, the Report adds:

"For example, a person who is hard of hearing is sub-stantially limited in the major life activity of hearing,

even though the loss may be corrected through theuse of a hearing aid. Likewise, persons with impairments, such as epilepsy or diabetes, which substantiallylimit a major life activity are covered under the first
prong of the definition of disability, even if the effects of
the impairment are controlled by medication." Ibid.(emphasis added).

All of the Reports, indeed, are replete with references tothe understanding that the Act's protected class includes
individuals with various medical conditions that ordinarilyare perfectly "correctable" with medication or treatment.
See id., at 74 (citing with approval Straithe v. Departmentof Transportation, 716 F. 2d 227 (CA3 1983), which held that
an individual with poor hearing was "handicapped" underthe Rehabilitation Act even though his hearing could be corrected with a hearing aid); H. R. Rep. No. 101-485, pt. III,at 51 ("[t]he term" disability includes "epilepsy, . . . heart
disease, diabetes"); id., pt. III, at 28 (listing same impair-ments); S. Rep. No. 101-116, at 22 (same).

In addition, each of the three Executive agencies chargedwith implementing the Act has consistently interpreted the

Act as mandating that the presence of disability turns on anindividual's uncorrected state. We have traditionally accorded respect to such views when, as here, the agencies"played a pivotal role in setting [the statutory] machinery in
motion." Ford Motor Credit Co. v. Milhollin, 444 U. S. 555,566 (1980) (brackets in original; internal quotation marks and

2 The House's decision to cover correctable impairments under subsection (A) of the statute seems, in retrospect, both deliberate and wise.
Much of the structure of the House Reports is borrowed from the Senate
Report; thus it appears that the House Committees consciously decided
to move the discussion of mitigating measures. This adjustment was
prudent because in a case in which an employer refuses, out of animus
or fear, to hire an individual who has a condition such as epilepsy that the
employer knows is controlled, it may be difficult to determine whether the
employer is viewing the individual in her uncorrected state or "regards"
her as substantially limited.

which [we] may properly resort" for additional guidance.

also Bragdon, 524 U. S., at 642 (invoking this maxim with
regard to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's(EEOC) interpretation of the ADA).

The EEOC's Interpretive Guidance provides that "[t]hedetermination of whether an individual is substantially limited in a major life activity must be made on a case by casebasis, without regard to mitigating measures such as medicines, or assistive or prosthetic devices." 29 CFR pt. 1630,App. $ 1630.2( j) (1998). The EEOC further explains:

"[A]n individual who uses artificial legs would . . . besubstantially limited in the major life activity of walking
because the individual is unable to walk without the aidof prosthetic devices. Similarly, a diabetic who without
insulin would lapse into a coma would be substantially
limited because the individual cannot perform major lifeactivities without the aid of medication."

Ibid.

The Department of Justice has reached the same conclusion.
Its regulations provide that "[t]he question of whether a per-son has a disability should be assessed without regard to

the availability of mitigating measures, such as reasonable
modification or auxiliary aids and services." 28 CFR pt. 35,App. A, $ 35.104 (1998). The Department of Transportation

has issued a regulation adopting this same definition of "dis-ability." See 49 CFR pt. 37.3 (1998).

In my judgment, the Committee Reports and the uniform
agency regulations merely confirm the message conveyed by
the text of the Act--at least insofar as it applies to impairments such as the loss of a limb, the inability to hear, or
any condition such as diabetes that is substantially limiting
without medication. The Act generally protects individuals
who have "correctable" substantially limiting impairments

from unjustified employment discrimination on the basis ofthose impairments. The question, then, is whether the fact

that Congress was specifically concerned about protecting aclass that included persons characterized as a "discrete and
insular minority" and that it estimated that class to include"some 43,000,000 Americans" means that we should construe
the term "disability" to exclude individuals with impair-ments that Congress probably did not have in mind.

II
The EEOC maintains that, in order to remain allegiantto the Act's structure and purpose, courts should always

answer "the question whether an individual has a disabil-ity . . . without regard to mitigating measures that the individual takes to ameliorate the effects of the impairment."Brief for United States et al. as

Amici Curiae 6. "[T]hereis nothing about poor vision," as the EEOC interprets the

Act, "that would justify adopting a different rule in thiscase."

Ibid.If a narrow reading of the term "disability" were necessary in order to avoid the danger that the Act might other-wise force United to hire pilots who might endanger the
lives of their passengers, it would make good sense to usethe "43,000,000 Americans" finding to confine its coverage.
There is, however, no such danger in this case. If a personis "disabled" within the meaning of the Act, she still cannot
prevail on a claim of discrimination unless she can provethat the employer took action "because of " that impairment, 42 U. S. C. $ 12112(a), and that she can, "with or with-out reasonable accommodation, . . . perform the essential
functions" of the job of a commercial airline pilot. See$ 12111(8). Even then, an employer may avoid liability if it
shows that the criteria of having uncorrected visual acuityof at least 20/100 is "job-related and consistent with business necessity" or if such vision (even if correctable to 20/20)would pose a health or safety hazard. $$ 12113(a) and (b).

504 SUTTON v. UNITED AIR LINES, INC.

Stevens, J., dissenting
This case, in other words, is not about whether petition-ers are genuinely qualified or whether they can perform the

job of an airline pilot without posing an undue safety risk.The case just raises the threshold question whether petitioners are members of the ADA's protected class. It simply
asks whether the ADA lets petitioners in the door in thesame way as the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of

1967 does for every person who is at least 40 years old, see29 U. S. C. $ 631(a), and as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act
of 1964 does for every single individual in the work force.Inside that door lies nothing more than basic protection from
irrational and unjustified discrimination because of a characteristic that is beyond a person's control. Hence, this particular case, at its core, is about whether, assuming that petitioners can prove that they are "qualified," the airline has
any duty to come forward with some legitimate explanation
for refusing to hire them because of their uncorrected eyesight, or whether the ADA leaves the airline free to decline
to hire petitioners on this basis even if it is acting purely on
the basis of irrational fear and stereotype.

I think it quite wrong for the Court to confine the coverage
of the Act simply because an interpretation of "disability"
that adheres to Congress' method of defining the class it
intended to benefit may also provide protection for "significantly larger numbers" of individuals, ante, at 487, than
estimated in the Act's findings. It has long been a "familiar
canon of statutory construction that remedial legislation
should be construed broadly to effectuate its purposes."
Tcherepnin v. Knight, 389 U. S. 332, 336 (1967). Congress
sought, in enacting the ADA, to "provide a . . . comprehensive national mandate for the discrimination against individuals with disabilities." 42 U. S. C. $ 12101(b)(1). The
ADA, following the lead of the Rehabilitation Act before it,
seeks to implement this mandate by encouraging employers
"to replace . . . reflexive reactions to actual or perceived
handicaps with actions based on medically sound judg527US2 Unit: $U84 [05-09-01 13:03:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ments." Arline, 480 U. S., at 284-285. Even if an author-ized agency could interpret this statutory structure so as to

pick and choose certain correctable impairments that Con-gress meant to exclude from this mandate, Congress surely
has not authorized us to do so.When faced with classes of individuals or types of discrimination that fall outside the core prohibitions of anti-discrimination statutes, we have consistently construed
those statutes to include comparable evils within their cov-erage, even when the particular evil at issue was beyond
Congress' immediate concern in passing the legislation.Congress, for instance, focused almost entirely on the problem of discrimination against African-Americans when itenacted Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. See, e. g.,
Steelworkers v. Weber, 443 U. S. 193, 202-203 (1979). Butthat narrow focus could not possibly justify a construction
of the statute that excluded Hispanic-Americans or Asian-Americans from its protection--or as we later decided (ironically enough, by relying on legislative history and according"great deference" to the EEOC's "interpretation"), Caucasians. See McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Transp. Co., 427U. S. 273, 279-280 (1976).

We unanimously applied this well-accepted method of in-terpretation last Term with respect to construing Title VII
to cover claims of same-sex sexual harassment. Oncale v.
Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc., 523 U. S. 75 (1998). Weexplained our holding as follows:

"As some courts have observed, male-on-male sexualharassment in the workplace was assuredly not the principal evil Congress was concerned with when it enactedTitle VII. But statutory prohibitions often go beyond
the principal evil to cover reasonably comparable evils,and it is ultimately the provisions of our laws rather
than the principal concerns of our legislators by whichwe are governed. Title VII prohibits `discriminat[ion]
. . . because of . . . sex' in the `terms' or `conditions'

of employment. Our holding that this includes sexualharassment must extend to sexual harassment of any

kind that meets the statutory requirements." Id., at79-80.

This approach applies outside of the discrimination contextas well. In H. J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co.,
492 U. S. 229 (1989), we rejected the argument that theRacketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO)
should be construed to cover only "organized crime" becauseCongress included findings in the Act's preamble emphasizing only that problem. See Pub. L. 91-452 $ 1, 84 Stat. 941.After surveying RICO's legislative history, we concluded
that even though "[t]he occasion for Congress' action was theperceived need to combat organized crime, . . . Congress for
cogent reasons chose to enact a more general statute, onewhich, although it had organized crime as its focus, was not
limited in application to organized crime." 492 U. S., at 248.3Under the approach we followed in

Oncale and H. J. Inc.,visual impairments should be judged by the same standard

as hearing impairments or any other medically controllablecondition. The nature of the discrimination alleged is of the
same character and should be treated accordingly.Indeed, it seems to me eminently within the purpose and
policy of the ADA to require employers who make hiring and
firing decisions based on individuals' uncorrected vision toclarify why having, for example, 20/100 uncorrected vision

3 The one notable exception to our use of this method of interpretation
occurred in the decision in General Elec. Co. v. Gilbert, 429 U. S. 125
(1976), in which the majority rejected an EEOC guideline and the heavy
weight of authority in the federal courts of appeals in order to hold that
Title VII did not prohibit discrimination on the basis of pregnancy-related
conditions. Given the fact that Congress swiftly "overruled" that decision in the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978, 92 Stat. 2076, 42 U. S. C.

$ 2000e(k), I submit that the views expressed in the dissenting opinions in
that case, 429 U. S., at 146 (opinion of Brennan, J.), and id., at 160 (opinion
of Stevens, J.), should be followed today.

or better is a valid job requirement. So long as an employerexplicitly makes its decision based on an impairment that in

some condition is substantially limiting, it matters not underthe structure of the Act whether that impairment is widely
shared or so rare that it is seriously misunderstood. Either
way, the individual has an impairment that is covered by thepurpose of the ADA, and she should be protected against

irrational stereotypes and unjustified disparate treatment onthat basis.

I do not mean to suggest, of course, that the ADA shouldbe read to prohibit discrimination on the basis of, say, blue
eyes, deformed fingernails, or heights of less than six feet.Those conditions, to the extent that they are even "impairments," do not substantially limit individuals in any
condition and thus are different in kind from the impairmentin the case before us. While not all eyesight that can be

enhanced by glasses is substantially limiting, having 20/200vision in one's better eye is, without treatment, a significant
hindrance. Only two percent of the population suffers fromsuch myopia.

4 Such acuity precludes a person from driving,

shopping in a public store, or viewing a computer screenfrom a reasonable distance. Uncorrected vision, therefore,

can be "substantially limiting" in the same way that unmedi-cated epilepsy or diabetes can be. Because Congress obviously intended to include individuals with the latter impair-ments in the Act's protected class, we should give petitioners
the same protection. III

The Court does not disagree that the logic of the ADArequires petitioners' visual impairments to be judged the
same as other "correctable" conditions. Instead of includ-ing petitioners within the Act's umbrella, however, the Court

decides, in this opinion and its companion, to expel all in-dividuals who, by using "measures [to] mitigate [their] impairment[s]," ante, at 475, are able to overcome substantiallimitations regarding major life activities. The Court, for
instance, holds that severe hypertension that is substantially
limiting without medication is not a "disability," Murphy v.
United Parcel Service, Inc., post, p. 516, and--perhaps even
more remarkably--indicates (directly contrary to the Act'slegislative history, see

supra, at 500-501) that diabetes that
is controlled only with insulin treatments is not a "disability"either,

ante, at 483-484.
The Court claims that this rule is necessary to avoid re-quiring courts to "speculate" about a person's "hypothetical"

condition and to preserve the Act's focus on making "individualized inquiries" into whether a person is disabled. Ante,at 483. The Court also asserts that its rejection of the general rule of viewing individuals in their unmitigated stateprevents distorting the scope of the Act's protected class to
cover a "much higher number" of persons than Congress es-timated in its findings. And, I suspect, the Court has been
cowed by respondent's persistent argument that viewing allindividuals in their unmitigated state will lead to a tidal
wave of lawsuits. None of the Court's reasoning, however,
justifies a construction of the Act that will obviously deprive
many of Congress' intended beneficiaries of the legal protection it affords.

The agencies' approach, the Court repeatedly contends,
"would create a system in which persons often must be
treated as members of a group of people with similar impairments, rather than individuals, [which] is both contrary to
the letter and spirit of the ADA." Ante, at 483-484. The
Court's mantra regarding the Act's "individualized approach," however, fails to support its holding. I agree that
the letter and spirit of the ADA is designed to deter decisionmaking based on group stereotypes, but the agencies' interpretation of the Act does not lead to this result. Nor does
it require courts to "speculate" about people's "hypothetical"

conditions. Viewing a person in her "unmitigated" state
simply requires examining that individual's abilities in a different state, not the abilities of every person who shares a
similar condition. It is just as easy individually to test petitioners' eyesight with their glasses on as with their glasses
off.5

Ironically, it is the Court's approach that actually condones
treating individuals merely as members of groups. That
misdirected approach permits any employer to dismiss out
of hand every person who has uncorrected eyesight worse
than 20/100 without regard to the specific qualifications of
those individuals or the extent of their abilities to overcome
their impairment. In much the same way, the Court's approach would seem to allow an employer to refuse to hire
every person who has epilepsy or diabetes that is controlled
by medication, or every person who functions efficiently with
a prosthetic limb.

Under the Court's reasoning, an employer apparently
could not refuse to hire persons with these impairments who
are substantially limited even with medication, see ante, at
487-488, but that group-based "exception" is more perverse
still. Since the purpose of the ADA is to dismantle employment barriers based on society's accumulated myths

5 For much the same reason, the Court's concern that the agencies'
approach would "lead to the anomalous result" that courts would ignore
"negative side effects suffered by an individual resulting from the use of
mitigating measures," ante, at 484, is misplaced. It seems safe to assume
that most individuals who take medication that itself substantially limits
a major life activity would be substantially limited in some other way
if they did not take the medication. The Court's examples of psychosis,
Parkinson's disease, and epilepsy certainly support this presumption. To
the extent that certain people may be substantially limited only when
taking "mitigating measures," it might fairly be said that just as contagiousness is symptomatic of a disability because an individual's "contagiousness and her physical impairment each [may result] from the same
underlying condition," School Bd. of Nassau Cty. v. Arline, 480 U. S. 273,
282 (1987), side effects are symptomatic of a disability because side effects
and a physical impairment may flow from the same underlying condition.

and fears, see 42 U. S. C. $ 12101(a)(8); Arline, 480 U. S., at283-284, it is especially ironic to deny protection for persons with substantially limiting impairments that, whencorrected, render them fully able and employable. Insofar
as the Court assumes that the majority of individuals with
impairments such as prosthetic limbs or epilepsy will stillbe covered under its approach because they are substantially limited "notwithstanding the use of a corrective de-vice,"

ante, at 488, I respectfully disagree as an empirical
matter. Although it is of course true that some of theseindividuals are substantially limited in any condition, Congress enacted the ADA in part because such individualsare

not ordinarily substantially limited in their mitigated
condition, but rather are often the victims of "stereotypic
assumptions not truly indicative of the individual ability ofsuch individuals to participate in, and contribute to, society."

42 U. S. C. $ 12101(a)(7).It has also been suggested that if we treat as "disabilities"
impairments that may be mitigated by measures as ordinaryand expedient as wearing eyeglasses, a flood of litigation
will ensue. The suggestion is misguided. Although visionis of critical importance for airline pilots, in most segments
of the economy whether an employee wears glasses--or uses
any of several other mitigating measures--is a matter of
complete indifference to employers. It is difficult to envision many situations in which a qualified employee who
needs glasses to perform her job might be fired--as the statute requires--"because of," $ 12112, the fact that she cannot
see well without them. Such a proposition would be ridiculous in the garden-variety case. On the other hand, if an
accounting firm, for example, adopted a guideline refusing to
hire any incoming accountant who has uncorrected vision of
less than 20/100--or, by the same token, any person who is
unable without medication to avoid having seizures--such a
rule would seem to be the essence of invidious discrimination.

In this case the quality of petitioners' uncorrected vision
is relevant only because the airline regards the ability to see

527US2 Unit: $U84 [05-09-01 13:03:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Stevens, J., dissenting
without glasses as an employment qualification for its pilots.Presumably it would not insist on such a qualification unless

it has a sound business justification for doing so (an issuewe do not address today). But if United regards petitioners
as unqualified because they cannot see well without glasses,
it seems eminently fair for a court also to use uncorrectedvision as the basis for evaluating petitioners' life activity of

seeing.Under the agencies' approach, individuals with poor eyesight and other correctable impairments will, of course, beable to file lawsuits claiming discrimination on that basis.
Yet all of those same individuals can already file employmentdiscrimination claims based on their race, sex, or religion,
and--provided they are at least 40 years old--their age.
Congress has never seen this as reason to restrict classes ofantidiscrimination coverage. Indeed, it is hard to believe

that providing individuals with one more antidiscriminationprotection will make any more of them file baseless or vexatious lawsuits. To the extent that the Court is concernedwith requiring employers to answer in litigation for every
employment practice that draws distinctions based on physi-cal attributes, that anxiety should be addressed not in this
case, but in one that presents an issue regarding employers'
affirmative defenses.

In the end, the Court is left only with its tenacious grip
on Congress' finding that "some 43,000,000 Americans have
one or more physical or mental disabilities," 42 U. S. C.

$ 12101(a)(1)--and that figure's legislative history extrapolated from a law review "article authored by the drafter of
the original ADA bill introduced in Congress in 1988."
Ante, at 484. We previously have observed that a "statement of congressional findings is a rather thin reed upon
which to base" a statutory construction. National Organization for Women, Inc. v. Scheidler, 510 U. S. 249, 260 (1994).
Even so, as I have noted above, I readily agree that the agencies' approach to the Act would extend coverage to more
than that number of people (although the Court's lofty esti527US2 Unit: $U84 [05-09-01 13:03:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN

mates, see ante, at 487, may be inflated because they do not
appear to exclude impairments that are not substantially
limiting). It is equally undeniable, however, that "43 million" is not a fixed cap on the Act's protected class: By including the "record of " and "regarded as" categories, Congress
fully expected the Act to protect individuals who lack, in
the Court's words, "actual" disabilities, and therefore are not
counted in that number.

What is more, in mining the depths of the history of the
43 million figure--surveying even agency reports that predate the drafting of any of this case's controlling legislation--the Court fails to acknowledge that its narrow approach may have the perverse effect of denying coverage for
a sizeable portion of the core group of 43 million. The Court
appears to exclude from the Act's protected class individuals
with controllable conditions such as diabetes and severe
hypertension that were expressly understood as substantially limiting impairments in the Act's Committee Reports,
see supra, at 500-501--and even, as the footnote in the margin shows, in the studies that produced the 43 million figure.6
Given the inability to make the 43 million figure fit any consistent method of interpreting the word "disabled," it would
be far wiser for the Court to follow--or at least to mention--
the documents reflecting Congress' contemporaneous understanding of the term: the Committee Reports on the actual
legislation.

Occupational hazards characterize many trades. The far-sighted pilot may have as much trouble seeing the instrument panel as the nearsighted pilot has in identifying a safeplace to land. The vision of appellate judges is sometimes
subconsciously obscured by a concern that their decision willlegalize issues best left to the private sphere or will magnify
the work of an already-overburdened judiciary. See Jack-son v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307, 326, 337-339 (1979) (S

tevens,J., dissenting). Although these concerns may help to explain the Court's decision to chart its own course--ratherthan to follow the one that has been well marked by Congress, by the overwhelming consensus of circuit judges,and by the Executive officials charged with the responsibility of administering the ADA--they surely do not justifythe Court's crabbed vision of the territory covered by this
important statute.Accordingly, although I express no opinion on the ultimate merits of petitioners' claim, I am persuaded that theyhave a disability covered by the ADA. I therefore respectfully dissent.

Justice Breyer, dissenting.
We must draw a statutory line that either (1) will includewithin the category of persons authorized to bring suit under

the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 some whom Con-gress may not have wanted to protect (those who wear ordinary eyeglasses), or (2) will exclude from the threshold cate-gory those whom Congress certainly did want to protect
(those who successfully use corrective devices or medicines,such as hearing aids or prostheses or medicine for epilepsy).
Faced with this dilemma, the statute's language, structure,basic purposes, and history require us to choose the former
statutory line, as Justice Stevens (whose opinion I join)well explains. I would add that, if the more generous choice
of threshold led to too many lawsuits that ultimately proved

without merit or otherwise drew too much time and atten-tion away from those whom Congress clearly sought to protect, there is a remedy. The Equal Employment Opportu-nity Commission (EEOC), through regulation, might draw
finer definitional lines, excluding some of those who wear
eyeglasses (say, those with certain vision impairments whoreadily can find corrective lenses), thereby cabining the

overly broad extension of the statute that the majority fears.The majority questions whether the EEOC could do so,
for the majority is uncertain whether the EEOC possessestypical agency regulation-writing authority with respect to
the statute's definitions. See ante, at 479-480. The majority poses this question because the section of the statute, 42
U. S. C. $ 12116, that says the EEOC "shall issue regulations" also says these regulations are "to carry out this subchapter" (namely, $ 12111 to $ 12117, the employment subchapter); and the section of the statute that contains the
three-pronged definition of "disability" precedes "this subchapter," the employment subchapter, to which $ 12116 specifically refers. (Emphasis added.)

Nonetheless, the employment subchapter, i. e., "this subchapter," includes other provisions that use the defined terms,
for example a provision that forbids "discriminat[ing] against

a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability." $ 12112(a). The EEOC might elaborate, through
regulations, on the meaning of "disability" in this lastmentioned provision, if elaboration is needed in order to
"carry out" the substantive provisions of "this subchapter."
An EEOC regulation that elaborated on the meaning of
this use of the word "disability" would fall within the scope
both of the basic definitional provision and also the substantive provisions of "this" later subchapter, for the word
"disability" appears in both places.

There is no reason to believe that Congress would have
wanted to deny the EEOC the power to issue such a regulation, at least if the regulation is consistent with the earlier

MURPHY v. UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe tenth circuit

No. 97-1992. Argued April 27, 1999--Decided June 22, 1999
Respondent United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS), hired petitioner as a mechanic, a position that required him to drive commercial vehicles. To
drive, he had to satisfy certain Department of Transportation (DOT)
health certification requirements, including having "no current clinical
diagnosis of high blood pressure likely to interfere with his/her ability to
operate a commercial vehicle safely." 49 CFR $ 391.41(b)(6). Despite
petitioner's high blood pressure, he was erroneously granted certification and commenced work. After the error was discovered, respondent
fired him on the belief that his blood pressure exceeded the DOT's requirements. Petitioner brought suit under Title I of the Americans
with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), the District Court granted respondent summary judgment, and the Tenth Circuit affirmed. Citing its decision in Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., 130 F. 3d 893, 902, aff'd, ante,
p. 471, that an individual claiming a disability under the ADA should
be assessed with regard to any mitigating or corrective measures employed, the Court of Appeals held that petitioner's hypertension is not
a disability because his doctor testified that when medicated, petitioner
functions normally in everyday activities. The court also affirmed the
District Court's determination that petitioner is not "regarded as" disabled under the ADA, explaining that respondent did not terminate him
on an unsubstantiated fear that he would suffer a heart attack or stroke,
but because his blood pressure exceeded the DOT's requirements for
commercial vehicle drivers.

Held:

1. Under the ADA, the determination of whether petitioner's impairment "substantially limits" one or more major life activities is made
with reference to the mitigating measures he employs. Sutton, ante,
p. 471. The Tenth Circuit concluded that, when medicated, petitioner's
high blood pressure does not substantially limit him in any major life
activity. Because the question whether petitioner is disabled when taking medication is not before this Court, there is no occasion here to
consider whether he is "disabled" due to limitations that persist despite
his medication or the negative side effects of his medication. P. 521.

2. Petitioner is not "regarded as" disabled because of his high blood
pressure. Under Sutton, ante, at 489, a person is "regarded as" dis527US2 Unit: $U85 [05-02-01 17:39:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Syllabus
abled within the ADA's meaning if, among other things, a covered entity
mistakenly believes that the person's actual, nonlimiting impairment
substantially limits one or more major life activities. Here, respondent
argues that it does not regard petitioner as substantially limited in the
major life activity of working, but, rather, regards him as unqualified to
work as a UPS mechanic because he is unable to obtain DOT health
certification. When referring to the major life activity of working, the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) defines "substantially limits" as "significantly restricted in the ability to perform either
a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes as compared
to the average person having comparable training, skills and abilities."
29 CFR $ 1630.2(j)(3)(i). Thus, one must be regarded as precluded from
more than a particular job. Assuming without deciding that the EEOC
regulations are valid, the Court concludes that the evidence that petitioner is regarded as unable to meet the DOT regulations is not sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether he is regarded as unable to perform a class of jobs utilizing his skills. At most,
petitioner has shown that he is regarded as unable to perform the job
of mechanic only when that job requires driving a commercial motor
vehicle--a specific type of vehicle used on a highway in interstate commerce. He has put forward no evidence that he is regarded as unable
to perform any mechanic job that does not call for driving a commercial
motor vehicle and thus does not require DOT certification. Indeed, it
is undisputed that he is generally employable as a mechanic, and there
is uncontroverted evidence that he could perform a number of mechanic
jobs. Consequently, petitioner has failed to show that he is regarded
as unable to perform a class of jobs. Rather, the undisputed record
evidence demonstrates that petitioner is, at most, regarded as unable to
perform only a particular job. This is insufficient, as a matter of law,
to prove that petitioner is regarded as substantially limited in the major
life activity of working. Pp. 521-525.

Opinion of the Court
not "substantially limi[t]" one or more of his major life activi-ties and whether it correctly determined that petitioner is

not "regarded as disabled." See $ 12102(2). In light of ourdecision in Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., ante, p. 471, we
conclude that the Court of Appeals' resolution of both issueswas correct.

I
Petitioner was first diagnosed with hypertension (highblood pressure) when he was 10 years old. Unmedicated,

his blood pressure is approximately 250/160. With medica-tion, however, petitioner's "hypertension does not significantly restrict his activities and . . . in general he can func-tion normally and can engage in activities that other persons
normally do." 946 F. Supp. 872, 875 (Kan. 1996) (discussingtestimony of petitioner's physician).

In August 1994, respondent hired petitioner as a mechanic,a position that required petitioner to drive commercial motor
vehicles. Petitioner does not challenge the District Court'sconclusion that driving a commercial motor vehicle is an essential function of the mechanic's job at UPS. Id., at 882-883. To drive such vehicles, however, petitioner had to satisfy certain health requirements imposed by the Departmentof Transportation (DOT). 49 CFR $ 391.41(a) (1998) ("A person shall not drive a commercial motor vehicle unless he/sheis physically qualified to do so and . . . has on his/her person
. . . a medical examiner's certificate that he/she is physicallyqualified to drive a commercial motor vehicle"). One such
requirement is that the driver of a commercial motor vehiclein interstate commerce have "no current clinical diagnosis of
high blood pressure likely to interfere with his/her ability tooperate a commercial vehicle safely." $ 391.41(b)(6).

At the time respondent hired him, petitioner's blood pres-sure was so high, measuring at 186/124, that he was not qualified for DOT health certification, see App. 98a-102a (Depart-ment of Transportation, Medical Regulatory Criteria for
Evaluation Under Section 391.41(b)(6), attached as exhibit to

Opinion of the Court
Affidavit and Testimony of John R. McMahon) (hereinafterMedical Regulatory Criteria). Nonetheless, petitioner was

erroneously granted certification, and he commenced work.In September 1994, a UPS medical supervisor who was reviewing petitioner's medical files discovered the error and
requested that petitioner have his blood pressure retested.Upon retesting, petitioner's blood pressure was measured at

160/102 and 164/104. See App. 48a (testimony of VaughnMurphy). On October 5, 1994, respondent fired petitioner
on the belief that his blood pressure exceeded the DOT's re-quirements for drivers of commercial motor vehicles.

Petitioner brought suit under Title I of the ADA in the
United States District Court for the District of Kansas.
The court granted respondent's motion for summary judgment. It held that, to determine whether petitioner is disabled under the ADA, his "impairment should be evaluated
in its medicated state." 946 F. Supp., at 881. Noting that
when petitioner is medicated he is inhibited only in lifting
heavy objects but otherwise functions normally, the court
held that petitioner is not "disabled" under the ADA. Id.,
at 881-882. The court also rejected petitioner's claim that
he was "regarded as" disabled, holding that respondent "did
not regard Murphy as disabled, only that he was not certifiable under DOT regulations." Id., at 882.

The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's judgment. 141 F. 3d 1185 (CA10 1999) ( judgt. order). Citing
its decision in Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., 130 F. 3d 893,
902 (CA10 1997), aff 'd, ante, p. 471, that an individual claiming a disability under the ADA should be assessed with regard to any mitigating or corrective measures employed, the
court held that petitioner's hypertension is not a disability
because his doctor had testified that when petitioner is medicated, he " `functions normally doing everyday activity that
an everyday person does.' " App. to Pet. for Cert. 4a. The
court also affirmed the District Court's determination that
petitioner is not "regarded as" disabled under the ADA. It

Opinion of the Court
explained that respondent did not terminate petitioner "onan unsubstantiated fear that he would suffer a heart attack

or stroke," but "because his blood pressure exceeded theDOT's requirements for drivers of commercial vehicles."
Id., at 5a. We granted certiorari, 525 U. S. 1063 (1999), andwe now affirm.

II
The first question presented in this case is whether thedetermination of petitioner's disability is made with reference to the mitigating measures he employs. We have an-swered that question in Sutton in the affirmative. Given
that holding, the result in this case is clear. The Court ofAppeals concluded that, when medicated, petitioner's high
blood pressure does not substantially limit him in any majorlife activity. Petitioner did not seek, and we did not grant,
certiorari on whether this conclusion was correct. Becausethe question whether petitioner is disabled when taking
medication is not before us, we have no occasion here to con-sider whether petitioner is "disabled" due to limitations that
persist despite his medication or the negative side effects ofhis medication. Instead, the question granted was limited
to whether, under the ADA, the determination of whetheran individual's impairment "substantially limits" one or more
major life activities should be made without considerationof mitigating measures. Consequently, we conclude that the
Court of Appeals correctly affirmed the grant of summaryjudgment in respondent's favor on the claim that petitioner
is substantially limited in one or more major life activitiesand thus disabled under the ADA.

III
The second issue presented is also largely resolved by ouropinion in

Sutton. Petitioner argues that the Court of Ap-peals erred in holding that he is not "regarded as" disabled

because of his high blood pressure. As we held in Sutton,ante, at 489, a person is "regarded as" disabled within the

522 MURPHY v. UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC.

Opinion of the Court
meaning of the ADA if a covered entity mistakenly believesthat the person's actual, nonlimiting impairment substantially limits one or more major life activities. Here, peti-tioner alleges that his hypertension is regarded as substantially limiting him in the major life activity of working, when
in fact it does not. To support this claim, he points to testi-mony from respondent's resource manager that respondent

fired petitioner due to his hypertension, which he claims evi-dences respondent's belief that petitioner's hypertension--
and consequent inability to obtain DOT certification--sub-stantially limits his ability to work. In response, respondent argues that it does not regard petitioner as substantially
limited in the major life activity of working but, rather, regards him as unqualified to work as a UPS mechanic because
he is unable to obtain DOT health certification.

As a preliminary matter, we note that there remains some
dispute as to whether petitioner meets the requirements for
DOT certification. As discussed above, petitioner was incorrectly granted DOT certification at his first examination
when he should have instead been found unqualified. See
supra, at 519-520. Upon retesting, although petitioner's
blood pressure was not low enough to qualify him for the
1-year certification that he had incorrectly been issued, it
was sufficient to qualify him for optional temporary DOT
health certification. App. 98a-102a (Medical Regulatory
Criteria). Had a physician examined petitioner and, in light
of his medical history, declined to issue a temporary DOT
certification, we would not second-guess that decision.
Here, however, it appears that UPS determined that petitioner could not meet the DOT standards and did not allow
him to attempt to obtain the optional temporary certification.
Id., at 84a-86a (testimony of Monica Sloan, UPS' company
nurse); id., at 54a-55a (testimony and affidavit of Vaughn
Murphy). We need not resolve the question whether petitioner could meet the standards for DOT health certification,
however, as it goes only to whether petitioner is qualified

Opinion of the Court
and whether respondent has a defense based on the DOTregulations, see

Albertson's, Inc. v. Kirkingburg, post, p. 555,
issues not addressed by the court below or raised in the peti-tion for certiorari.

The only issue remaining is whether the evidence that
petitioner is regarded as unable to obtain DOT certification(regardless of whether he can, in fact, obtain optional temporary certification) is sufficient to create a genuine issue ofmaterial fact as to whether petitioner is regarded as substantially limited in one or more major life activities. As in Sutton, ante, at 491-492, we assume, arguendo, that the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) regulations
regarding the disability determination are valid. When referring to the major life activity of working, the EEOC defines "substantially limits" as: "significantly restricted in the
ability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of
jobs in various classes as compared to the average person
having comparable training, skills and abilities." 29 CFR

$ 1630.2( j)(3)(i) (1998). The EEOC further identifies several
factors that courts should consider when determining
whether an individual is substantially limited in the major
life activity of working, including "the number and types of
jobs utilizing similar training, knowledge, skills or abilities,
within [the] geographical area [reasonably accessible to the
individual], from which the individual is also disqualified."

$ 1630.2( j)(3)(ii)(B). Thus, to be regarded as substantially
limited in the major life activity of working, one must be
regarded as precluded from more than a particular job. See

$ 1630.2( j)(3)(i) ("The inability to perform a single, particular
job does not constitute a substantial limitation in the major
life activity of working").

Again, assuming without deciding that these regulations
are valid, petitioner has failed to demonstrate that there is
a genuine issue of material fact as to whether he is regarded
as disabled. Petitioner was fired from the position of UPS
mechanic because he has a physical impairment--hyperten527US2 Unit: $U85 [05-02-01 17:39:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
sion--that is regarded as preventing him from obtaining
DOT health certification. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 5a
(UPS terminated Murphy because "his blood pressure exceeded the DOT's requirements for drivers of commercial vehicles"); 946 F. Supp., at 882 ("[T]he court concludes UPS did
not regard Murphy as disabled, only that he was not certifiable under DOT regulations"); App. 125a, || 18 (Defendant's
Memorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment)
("UPS considers driving commercial motor vehicles an essential function of plaintiff 's job as mechanic"); id., at 103a
(testimony of John R. McMahon) (stating that the reason why
petitioner was fired was that he "did not meet the requirements of the Department of Transportation").

The evidence that petitioner is regarded as unable to meet
the DOT regulations is not sufficient to create a genuine
issue of material fact as to whether petitioner is regarded as
unable to perform a class of jobs utilizing his skills. At
most, petitioner has shown that he is regarded as unable to
perform the job of mechanic only when that job requires
driving a commercial motor vehicle--a specific type of vehicle used on a highway in interstate commerce. 49 CFR

$ 390.5 (1998) (defining "commercial motor vehicle" as a vehicle weighing over 10,000 pounds, designed to carry 16 or
more passengers, or used in the transportation of hazardous
materials). Petitioner has put forward no evidence that he
is regarded as unable to perform any mechanic job that does
not call for driving a commercial motor vehicle and thus does
not require DOT certification. Indeed, it is undisputed that
petitioner is generally employable as a mechanic. Petitioner
has "performed mechanic jobs that did not require DOT certification" for "over 22 years," and he secured another job as
a mechanic shortly after leaving UPS. 946 F. Supp., at 875,
876. Moreover, respondent presented uncontroverted evidence that petitioner could perform jobs such as diesel mechanic, automotive mechanic, gas-engine repairer, and gas527US2 Unit: $U85 [05-02-01 17:39:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Stevens, J., dissenting
welding equipment mechanic, all of which utilize petitioner'smechanical skills. See App. 115a (report of Lewis Vierling).

Consequently, in light of petitioner's skills and the arrayof jobs available to petitioner utilizing those skills, petitioner
has failed to show that he is regarded as unable to performa class of jobs. Rather, the undisputed record evidence
demonstrates that petitioner is, at most, regarded as unableto perform only a particular job. This is insufficient, as a
matter of law, to prove that petitioner is regarded as sub-stantially limited in the major life activity of working. See
Sutton, ante, at 492-493. Accordingly, the Court of Appealscorrectly granted summary judgment in favor of respondent
on petitioner's claim that he is regarded as disabled. Forthe reasons stated, we affirm the judgment of the Court of
Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. It is so ordered.

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Breyer joins,dissenting.
For the reasons stated in my dissenting opinion in Suttonv.

United Air Lines, Inc., ante, at 495, I respectfully dissent.I believe that petitioner has a "disability" within the meaning of the ADA because, assuming petitioner's uncontestedevidence to be true, his very severe hypertension--in its unmedicated state--"substantially limits" his ability to performseveral major life activities. Without medication, petitioner
would likely be hospitalized. See App. 81. Indeed, unlike
Sutton, this case scarcely requires us to speculate whetherCongress intended the Act to cover individuals with this impairment. Severe hypertension, in my view, easily falls
within the ADA's nucleus of covered impairments. See Sutton, ante, at 496-503 (Stevens, J., dissenting).

Because the Court of Appeals did not address whetherpetitioner was qualified or whether he could perform the

essential job functions, App. to Pet. for Cert. 5a, I wouldreverse and remand for further proceedings.

KOLSTAD v. AMERICAN DENTAL ASSOCIATION
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe district of columbia circuit

No. 98-208. Argued March 1, 1999--Decided June 22, 1999
Petitioner sued respondent under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964

(Title VII), asserting that respondent's decision to promote Tom Spangler over her was a proscribed act of gender discrimination. Petitioner
alleged, and introduced testimony to prove, that, among other things,
the entire selection process was a sham, the stated reasons of respondent's executive director for selecting Spangler were pretext, and Spangler had been chosen before the formal selection process began. The
District Court denied petitioner's request for a jury instruction on punitive damages, which are authorized by the Civil Rights Act of 1991 (1991
Act) for Title VII cases in which the employee "demonstrates" that the
employer has engaged in intentional discrimination and has done so
"with malice or with reckless indifference to [the employee's] federally
protected rights." 42 U. S. C. $ 1981a(b)(1). In affirming that denial,
the en banc Court of Appeals concluded that, before the jury can be
instructed on punitive damages, the evidence must demonstrate that
the defendant has engaged in some "egregious" misconduct, and that
petitioner had failed to make the requisite showing in this case.

Held:

1. An employer's conduct need not be independently "egregious" to
satisfy $ 1981a's requirements for a punitive damages award, although
evidence of egregious behavior may provide a valuable means by which
an employee can show the "malice" or "reckless indifference" needed to
qualify for such an award. The 1991 Act provided for compensatory
and punitive damages in addition to the backpay and other equitable
relief to which prevailing Title VII plaintiffs had previously been limited. Section 1981a's two-tiered structure--it limits compensatory and
punitive awards to cases of "intentional discrimination," $ 1981a(a)(1),
and further qualifies the availability of punitive awards to instances of
"malice" or "reckless indifference"--suggests a congressional intent to
impose two standards of liability, one for establishing a right to compensatory damages and another, higher standard that a plaintiff must satisfy to qualify for a punitive award. The terms "malice" and "reckless
indifference" ultimately focus on the actor's state of mind, however, and

$ 1981a does not require a showing of egregious or outrageous discrimination independent of the employer's state of mind. Nor does the stat527US2 Unit: $U86 [05-02-01 17:54:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN

527Cite as: 527 U. S. 526 (1999)
Syllabus
ute's structure imply an independent role for "egregiousness" in the face
of congressional silence. On the contrary, the view that $ 1981a provides for punitive awards based solely on an employer's state of mind is
consistent with the 1991 Act's distinction between equitable and compensatory relief. Intent determines which remedies are open to a
plaintiff here as well. This focus on the employer's state of mind does
give effect to the statute's two-tiered structure. The terms "malice"
and "reckless indifference" pertain not to the employer's awareness that
it is engaging in discrimination, but to its knowledge that it may be
acting in violation of federal law, see, e. g., Smith v. Wade, 461 U. S. 30,
37, n. 6, 41, 50. There will be circumstances where intentional discrimination does not give rise to punitive damages liability under this standard, as where the employer is unaware of the relevant federal prohibition or discriminates with the distinct belief that its discrimination is
lawful, where the underlying theory of discrimination is novel or otherwise poorly recognized, or where the employer reasonably believes that
its discrimination satisfies a bona fide occupational qualification defense
or other statutory exception to liability. See Hazen Paper Co. v. Biggins, 507 U. S. 604, 616, 617. Although there is some support for
respondent's assertion that the common law punitive awards tradition
includes an "egregious misconduct" requirement, eligibility for such
awards most often is characterized in terms of a defendant's evil motive
or intent. Egregious or outrageous acts may serve as evidence supporting an inference of such evil motive, but $ 1981a does not limit plaintiffs to this form of evidence or require a showing of egregious or outrageous discrimination independent of the employer's state of mind.
Pp. 533-539.

2. The inquiry does not end with a showing of the requisite mental
state by certain employees, however. Petitioner must impute liability
for punitive damages to respondent. Common law limitations on a
principal's vicarious liability for its agents' acts apply in the Title VII
context. See, e. g., Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U. S. 742,
754. The Court's discussion of this question is informed by the general
common law of agency, as codified in the Restatement (Second) of
Agency, see, e. g., id., at 755, which, among other things, authorizes punitive damages "against a . . . principal because of an [agent's] act . . .
if . . . the agent was employed in a managerial capacity and was acting in
the scope of employment," $ 217 C(c), and declares that even intentional,
specifically forbidden torts are within such scope if the conduct is "the
kind [the employee] is employed to perform," "occurs substantially
within the authorized time and space limits," and "is actuated, at least
in part, by a purpose to serve the" employer, $$ 228(1), 230, Comment
b. Under these rules, even an employer who made every good faith

528 KOLSTAD v. AMERICAN DENTAL ASSN.

Syllabus
effort to comply with Title VII would be held liable for the discriminatory acts of agents acting in a "managerial capacity." Holding such an
employer liable, however, is in some tension with the principle that it is
"improper . . . to award punitive damages against one who himself is
personally innocent and therefore liable only vicariously," Restatement
(Second) of Torts $ 909, Comment b. Applying the Restatement of
Agency's "scope of employment" rule in this context, moreover, would
reduce the incentive for employers to implement antidiscrimination programs and would, in fact, likely exacerbate employers' concerns that 42
U. S. C. $ 1981a's "malice" and "reckless indifference" standard penalizes
those employers who educate themselves and their employees on Title
VII's prohibitions. Dissuading employers from implementing programs
or policies to prevent workplace discrimination is directly contrary to
Title VII's prophylactic purposes. See, e. g., Burlington Industries,
Inc., 524 U. S., at 764. Thus, the Court is compelled to modify the Restatement rules to avoid undermining Title VII's objectives. See, e. g.,
ibid. The Court therefore agrees that, in the punitive damages context,
an employer may not be vicariously liable for the discriminatory employment decisions of managerial agents where these decisions are contrary to the employer's good faith efforts to comply with Title VII.
Pp. 539-546.

3. The question whether petitioner can identify facts sufficient to support an inference that the requisite mental state can be imputed to respondent is left for remand. The parties have not yet had an opportunity to marshal the record evidence in support of their views on the
application of agency principles in this case, and the en banc Court of
Appeals had no reason to resolve the issue because it concluded that
petitioner had failed to demonstrate the requisite "egregious" misconduct. P. 546.

A

In September 1992, Jack O'Donnell announced that hewould be retiring as the Director of Legislation and Legislative Policy and Director of the Council on Government Af-fairs and Federal Dental Services for respondent, American
Dental Association (respondent or Association). Petitioner,Carole Kolstad, was employed with O'Donnell in respondent's Washington, D. C., office, where she was serving asrespondent's Director of Federal Agency Relations. When
she learned of O'Donnell's retirement, she expressed an in-terest in filling his position. Also interested in replacing
O'Donnell was Tom Spangler, another employee in respond-ent's Washington office. At this time, Spangler was serving as the Association's Legislative Counsel, a position thatinvolved him in respondent's legislative lobbying efforts.
Both petitioner and Spangler had worked directly withO'Donnell, and both had received "distinguished" performance ratings by the acting head of the Washington office,Leonard Wheat.

Both petitioner and Spangler formally applied for O'Don-nell's position, and Wheat requested that Dr. William Allen,

After interviewing both petitioner and Spangler,Wheat recommended that Allen select Spangler for O'Donnell's post.

Opinion of the Court
placement. Petitioner's challenge to this employment deci-sion forms the basis of the instant action.

B
After first exhausting her avenues for relief before theEqual Employment Opportunity Commission, petitioner filed

suit against the Association in Federal District Court, alleg-ing that respondent's decision to promote Spangler was an
act of employment discrimination proscribed under Title VII.In petitioner's view, the entire selection process was a sham.
Tr. 8 (Oct. 26, 1995) (closing argument for plaintiff 's counsel).Counsel for petitioner urged the jury to conclude that Allen's
stated reasons for selecting Spangler were pretext for gen-der discrimination,

id., at 19, 24, and that Spangler had beenchosen for the position before the formal selection process

began, id., at 19. Among the evidence offered in support ofthis view, there was testimony to the effect that Allen modified the description of O'Donnell's post to track aspects ofthe job description used to hire Spangler. See

id., at 132-136 (Oct. 19, 1995) (testimony of Cindy Simms); id., at 48-51

(Oct. 20, 1995) (testimony of Leonard Wheat). In petition-er's view, this "preselection" procedure suggested an intent
by the Association to discriminate on the basis of sex. Id.,at 24. Petitioner also introduced testimony at trial that
Wheat told sexually offensive jokes and that he had referredto certain prominent professional women in derogatory
terms. See id., at 120-124 (Oct. 18, 1995) (testimony of Car-ole Kolstad). Moreover, Wheat allegedly refused to meet
with petitioner for several weeks regarding her interest inO'Donnell's position. See

id., at 112-113. Petitioner testi-fied, in fact, that she had historically experienced difficulty

gaining access to meet with Wheat. See id., at 114-115.
Allen, for his part, testified that he conducted informal meet-ings regarding O'Donnell's position with both petitioner and

Spangler, see id., at 148 (Oct. 23, 1995), although petitioner

Opinion of the Court
stated that Allen did not discuss the position with her, see
id., at 127-128 (Oct. 18, 1995).

The District Court denied petitioner's request for a juryinstruction on punitive damages. The jury concluded that

respondent had discriminated against petitioner on the basis
of sex and awarded her backpay totaling $52,718. App. 109-110. Although the District Court subsequently denied respondent's motion for judgment as a matter of law on theissue of liability, the court made clear that it had not been
persuaded that respondent had selected Spangler over peti-tioner on the basis of sex, and the court denied petitioner's
requests for reinstatement and for attorney's fees. 912
F. Supp. 13, 15 (DC 1996).

Petitioner appealed from the District Court's decisions denying her requested jury instruction on punitive damages
and her request for reinstatement and attorney's fees. Respondent cross-appealed from the denial of its motion for
judgment as a matter of law. In a split decision, a panel of
the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia reversed
the District Court's decision denying petitioner's request for
an instruction on punitive damages. 108 F. 3d 1431, 1435
(1997). In so doing, the court rejected respondent's claim
that punitive damages are available under Title VII only
in " `extraordinarily egregious cases.' " Id., at 1437. The
panel reasoned that, "because `the state of mind necessary
to trigger liability for the wrong is at least as culpable as
that required to make punitive damages applicable,' " id., at
1438 (quoting Rowlett v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., 832 F. 2d 194,
205 (CA1 1987)), the fact that the jury could reasonably have
found intentional discrimination meant that the jury should
have been permitted to consider punitive damages. The
court noted, however, that not all cases involving intentional
discrimination would support a punitive damages award.
108 F. 3d, at 1438. Such an award might be improper, the
panel reasoned, in instances where the employer justifiably
believes that intentional discrimination is permitted or

Opinion of the Court
where an employee engages in discrimination outside thescope of that employee's authority. Id., at 1438-1439.

Here, the court concluded, respondent "neither attempted tojustify the use of sex in its promotion decision nor disavowed
the actions of its agents." Id., at 1439.The Court of Appeals subsequently agreed to rehear the
case en banc, limited to the punitive damages question. Ina divided opinion, the court affirmed the decision of the District Court. 139 F. 3d 958 (1998). The en banc majorityconcluded that, "before the question of punitive damages can
go to the jury, the evidence of the defendant's culpabilitymust exceed what is needed to show intentional discrimination." Id., at 961. Based on the 1991 Act's structure andlegislative history, the court determined, specifically, that a
defendant must be shown to have engaged in some "egre-gious" misconduct before the jury is permitted to consider a
request for punitive damages. Id., at 965. Although thecourt declined to set out the "egregiousness" requirement in
any detail, it concluded that petitioner failed to make therequisite showing in the instant case. Judge Randolph concurred, relying chiefly on $ 1981a's structure as evidence of acongressional intent to "limi[t] punitive damages to exceptional cases." Id., at 970. Judge Tatel wrote in dissent forfive judges, who agreed generally with the panel majority.

We granted certiorari, 525 U. S. 960 (1998), to resolve aconflict among the Federal Courts of Appeals concerning the
circumstances under which a jury may consider a request forpunitive damages under $ 1981a(b)(1). Compare 139 F. 3d
958 (CADC 1998) (case below), with Luciano v. Olsten Corp.,110 F. 3d 210, 219-220 (CA2 1997) (rejecting contention that
punitive damages require showing of "extraordinarily egre-gious" conduct).

A
Prior to 1991, only equitable relief, primarily backpay, wasavailable to prevailing Title VII plaintiffs; the statute pro527US2 Unit: $U86 [05-02-01 17:54:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN
534 KOLSTAD v. AMERICAN DENTAL ASSN.

Opinion of the Court
vided no authority for an award of punitive or compensatorydamages. See

Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U. S.
244, 252-253 (1994). With the passage of the 1991 Act, Con-gress provided for additional remedies, including punitive

damages, for certain classes of Title VII and ADA violations.

The 1991 Act limits compensatory and punitive damagesawards, however, to cases of "intentional discrimination"--

that is, cases that do not rely on the "disparate impact" the-ory of discrimination. 42 U. S. C. $ 1981a(a)(1). Section
1981a(b)(1) further qualifies the availability of punitiveawards:

"A complaining party may recover punitive damagesunder this section against a respondent (other than a
government, government agency or political subdivi-sion) if the complaining party demonstrates that the
respondent engaged in a discriminatory practice ordiscriminatory practices

with malice or with reckless
indifference to the federally protected rights of an aggrieved individual." (Emphasis added.)

The very structure of $ 1981a suggests a congressional in-tent to authorize punitive awards in only a subset of cases

involving intentional discrimination. Section 1981a(a)(1)limits compensatory and punitive awards to instances of
intentional discrimination, while $ 1981a(b)(1) requires plaintiffs to make an additional "demonstrat[ion]" of their eligibil-ity for punitive damages. Congress plainly sought to impose two standards of liability--one for establishing a rightto compensatory damages and another, higher standard that
a plaintiff must satisfy to qualify for a punitive award.

The Court of Appeals sought to give life to this two-tiered
structure by limiting punitive awards to cases involving
intentional discrimination of an "egregious" nature. We
credit the en banc majority's effort to effectuate congressional intent, but, in the end, we reject its conclusion that
eligibility for punitive damages can only be described in

Opinion of the Court
terms of an employer's "egregious" misconduct. The terms"malice" and "reckless" ultimately focus on the actor's state

of mind. See, e. g., Black's Law Dictionary 956-957, 1270(6th ed. 1990); see also W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, &
D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton, Law of Torts 212-214 (5th ed.
1984) (defining "willful," "wanton," and "reckless"). Whileegregious misconduct is evidence of the requisite mental

state, see infra, at 538-539; Keeton, supra, at 213-214,$ 1981a does not limit plaintiffs to this form of evidence, and
the section does not require a showing of egregious or out-rageous discrimination independent of the employer's state
of mind. Nor does the statute's structure imply an independent role for "egregiousness" in the face of congressional silence. On the contrary, the view that $ 1981a provides for
punitive awards based solely on an employer's state of mind
is consistent with the 1991 Act's distinction between equitable and compensatory relief. Intent determines which remedies are open to a plaintiff here as well; compensatory awards
are available only where the employer has engaged in "intentional discrimination." $ 1981a(a)(1) (emphasis added).

Moreover, $ 1981a's focus on the employer's state of mind
gives some effect to Congress' apparent intent to narrow the
class of cases for which punitive awards are available to a
subset of those involving intentional discrimination. The
employer must act with "malice or with reckless indifference
to the [plaintiff 's] federally protected rights." $ 1981a(b)(1)
(emphasis added). The terms "malice" or "reckless indifference" pertain to the employer's knowledge that it may be
acting in violation of federal law, not its awareness that it is
engaging in discrimination.

We gain an understanding of the meaning of the terms
"malice" and "reckless indifference," as used in $ 1981a, from
this Court's decision in Smith v. Wade, 461 U. S. 30 (1983).
The parties, as well as both the en banc majority and dissent,
recognize that Congress looked to the Court's decision in
Smith in adopting this language in $ 1981a. See Tr. of Oral

Opinion of the Court
Arg. 28-29; Brief for Petitioner 24; 139 F. 3d, at 964-965; id.,at 971 (Tatel, J., dissenting). Employing language similar to

what later appeared in $ 1981a, the Court concluded in Smiththat "a jury may be permitted to assess punitive damages in
an action under $ 1983 when the defendant's conduct is shown
to be motivated by evil motive or intent, or when it involvesreckless or callous indifference to the federally protected

rights of others." 461 U. S., at 56. While the Smith Courtdetermined that it was unnecessary to show actual malice to
qualify for a punitive award, id., at 45-48, its intent stand-ard, at a minimum, required recklessness in its subjective
form. The Court referred to a "subjective consciousness" of
a risk of injury or illegality and a " `criminal indifference to
civil obligations.' " Id., at 37, n. 6, 41 (quoting Philadelphia,
W. & B. R. Co. v. Quigley, 21 How. 202, 214 (1859)); see also
Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U. S. 825, 837 (1994) (explaining that
criminal law employs a subjective form of recklessness, requiring a finding that the defendant "disregards a risk of
harm of which he is aware"); see generally 1 T. Sedgwick,
Measure of Damages $$ 366, 368, pp. 528, 529 (8th ed. 1891)
(describing "wantonness" in punitive damages context in
terms of "criminal indifference" and "gross negligence" in
terms of a "conscious indifference to consequences"). The
Court thus compared the recklessness standard to the requirement that defendants act with " `knowledge of falsity or
reckless disregard for the truth' " before punitive awards are
available in defamation actions, Smith, supra, at 50 (quoting Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U. S. 323, 349 (1974)),
a subjective standard, Harte-Hanks Communications, Inc.
v. Connaughton, 491 U. S. 657, 688 (1989). Applying this
standard in the context of $ 1981a, an employer must at least
discriminate in the face of a perceived risk that its actions
will violate federal law to be liable in punitive damages.

There will be circumstances where intentional discrimination does not give rise to punitive damages liability under
this standard. In some instances, the employer may simply

527US2 Unit: $U86 [05-02-01 17:54:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN

537Cite as: 527 U. S. 526 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
be unaware of the relevant federal prohibition. There willbe cases, moreover, in which the employer discriminates

with the distinct belief that its discrimination is lawful. Theunderlying theory of discrimination may be novel or otherwise poorly recognized, or an employer may reasonably believe that its discrimination satisfies a bona fide occupationalqualification defense or other statutory exception to liability.

See, e. g., 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-2(e)(1) (setting out Title VII de-fense "where religion, sex, or national origin is a bona fide
occupational qualification"); see also $ 12113 (setting out de-fenses under ADA). In

Hazen Paper Co. v. Biggins, 507
U. S. 604, 616 (1993), we thus observed that, in light of statutory defenses and other exceptions permitting age-based decisionmaking, an employer may knowingly rely on age to
make employment decisions without recklessly violating the
Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA).
Accordingly, we determined that limiting liquidated damages
under the ADEA to cases where the employer "knew or
showed reckless disregard for the matter of whether its conduct was prohibited by the statute," without an additional
showing of outrageous conduct, was sufficient to give effect
to the ADEA's two-tiered liability scheme. Id., at 616, 617.

At oral argument, respondent urged that the common law
tradition surrounding punitive awards includes an "egregious misconduct" requirement. See, e. g., Tr. of Oral Arg.
26-28; see also Brief for Chamber of Commerce of the United
States as Amicus Curiae 8-22 (advancing this argument).
We assume that Congress, in legislating on punitive awards,
imported common law principles governing this form of relief. See, e. g., Molzof v. United States, 502 U. S. 301, 307
(1992). Moreover, some courts and commentators have described punitive awards as requiring both a specified state
of mind and egregious or aggravated misconduct. See, e. g.,
1 D. Dobbs, Law of Remedies 468 (2d ed. 1993) ("Punitive
damages are awarded when the defendant is guilty of both a
bad state of mind and highly serious misconduct").

538 KOLSTAD v. AMERICAN DENTAL ASSN.

Opinion of the Court
Most often, however, eligibility for punitive awards ischaracterized in terms of a defendant's motive or intent.

See, e. g., 1 Sedgwick, supra, at 526, 528; C. McCormick, Lawof Damages 280 (1935). Indeed, "[t]he justification of exemplary damages lies in the evil intent of the defendant." 1
Sedgwick, supra, at 526; see also 2 J. Sutherland, Law ofDamages $ 390, p. 1079 (3d ed. 1903) (discussing punitive

damages under rubric of "[c]ompensation for wrongs donewith bad motive"). Accordingly, "a positive element of conscious wrongdoing is always required." McCormick, supra,at 280.

Egregious misconduct is often associated with the award
of punitive damages, but the reprehensible character of the
conduct is not generally considered apart from the requisite
state of mind. Conduct warranting punitive awards has
been characterized as "egregious," for example, because of
the defendant's mental state. See Restatement (Second) of
Torts $ 908(2) (1979) ("Punitive damages may be awarded for
conduct that is outrageous, because of the defendant's evil
motive or his reckless indifference to the rights of others").
Respondent, in fact, appears to endorse this characterization.
See, e. g., Brief for Respondent 19 ("Malicious and reckless
conduct [is] by definition egregious"); see also id., at 28-29.
That conduct committed with the specified mental state may
be characterized as egregious, however, is not to say that
employers must engage in conduct with some independent,
"egregious" quality before being subject to a punitive award.

To be sure, egregious or outrageous acts may serve as evidence supporting an inference of the requisite "evil motive."
"The allowance of exemplary damages depends upon the bad
motive of the wrong-doer as exhibited by his acts." 1 Sedgwick, supra, at 529 (emphasis added); see also 2 Sutherland, supra, $ 394, at 1101 ("The spirit which actuated the
wrong-doer may doubtless be inferred from the circumstances surrounding the parties and the transaction"); see,
e. g., Chizmar v. Mackie, 896 P. 2d 196, 210 (Alaska 1995)

Opinion of the Court
("[W]here there is no evidence that gives rise to an inferenceof actual malice or conduct sufficiently outrageous to be

deemed equivalent to actual malice, the trial court need not,and indeed should not, submit the issue of punitive damages
to the jury" (internal quotation marks omitted)); Horton v.
Union Light, Heat & Power Co., 690 S. W. 2d 382, 389 (Ky.1985) (observing that "malice . . . may be implied from outrageous conduct"). Likewise, under $ 1981a(b)(1), pointing toevidence of an employer's egregious behavior would provide
one means of satisfying the plaintiff 's burden to "demon-strat[e]" that the employer acted with the requisite "malice
or . . . reckless indifference." See 42 U. S. C. $ 1981a(b)(1);see,

e. g., 3 BNA EEOC Compliance Manual N:6085-N6084(1992) (Enforcement Guidance: Compensatory and Punitive

Damages Available Under $ 102 of the Civil Rights Act of1991) (listing "[t]he degree of egregiousness and nature of
the respondent's conduct" among evidence tending to showmalice or reckless disregard). Again, however, respondent
has not shown that the terms "reckless indifference" and"malice," in the punitive damages context, have taken on a
consistent definition including an independent, "egregious-ness" requirement. Cf.

Morissette v. United States, 342U. S. 246, 263 (1952) ("[W]here Congress borrows terms of

art in which are accumulated the legal tradition and meaningof centuries of practice, it presumably knows and adopts the
cluster of ideas that were attached to each borrowed wordin the body of learning from which it was taken and the
meaning its use will convey to the judicial mind unless other-wise instructed").

B
The inquiry does not end with a showing of the requisite"malice or . . . reckless indifference" on the part of certain

individuals, however. 42 U. S. C. $ 1981a(b)(1). The plain-tiff must impute liability for punitive damages to respondent.
The en banc dissent recognized that agency principles placelimits on vicarious liability for punitive damages. 139 F. 3d,

Opinion of the Court
at 974 (Tatel, J., dissenting). Likewise, the Solicitor Generalas

amicus acknowledged during argument that common law
limitations on a principal's liability in punitive awards for theacts of its agents apply in the Title VII context. Tr. of Oral

Arg. 23.

Justice Stevens urges that we should not consider theselimitations here. See

post, at 552-553 (opinion concurring
in part and dissenting in part). While we decline to engagein any definitive application of the agency standards to the

facts of this case, see infra, at 546, it is important that weaddress the proper legal standards for imputing liability to
an employer in the punitive damages context. This issue is
intimately bound up with the preceding discussion on the
evidentiary showing necessary to qualify for a punitive award,
and it is easily subsumed within the question on which we
granted certiorari--namely, "[i]n what circumstances may

punitive damages be awarded under Title VII of the 1964
Civil Rights Act, as amended, for unlawful intentional discrimination?" Pet. for Cert. i; see also this Court's Rule
14.1(a). "On a number of occasions, this Court has considered issues waived by the parties below and in the petition
for certiorari because the issues were so integral to decision
of the case that they could be considered `fairly subsumed'
by the actual questions presented." Gilmer v. Interstate/
Johnson Lane Corp., 500 U. S. 20, 37 (1991) (Stevens, J.,
dissenting) (citing cases). The Court has not always confined itself to the set of issues addressed by the parties.
See, e. g., Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment, 523
U. S. 83, 93-102, and n. 1 (1998); H. J. Inc. v. Northwestern
Bell Telephone Co., 492 U. S. 229, 243-249 (1989); Continental Ill. Nat. Bank & Trust Co. v. Chicago R. I. & P. R. Co.,
294 U. S. 648, 667-675 (1935). Here, moreover, limitations
on the extent to which principals may be liable in punitive
damages for the torts of their agents was the subject of discussion by both the en banc majority and dissent, see 139

briefing, see Brief for Chamber of Commerce of the UnitedStates as

Amicus Curiae 22-27, and substantial questioning
at oral argument, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 11-17, 19-24, 49-50,54-55. Nor did respondent discount the notion that agency

principles may place limits on an employer's vicarious liability for punitive damages. See post, at 552. In fact, respond-ent advanced the general position "that the higher agency

principles, under common law, would apply to punitive dam-ages." Tr. of Oral Arg. 49. Accordingly, we conclude that
these potential limitations on the extent of respondent's lia-bility are properly considered in the instant case.

The common law has long recognized that agency principles limit vicarious liability for punitive awards. See, e. g.,
G. Field, Law of Damages $$ 85-87 (1876); 1 Sedgwick, Damages $ 378; McCormick, Damages $ 80; 2 F. Mechem, Law of
Agency $$ 2014-2015 (2d ed. 1914). This is a principle,
moreover, that this Court historically has endorsed. See,
e. g., Lake Shore & Michigan Southern R. Co. v. Prentice,
147 U. S. 101, 114-115 (1893); The Amiable Nancy, 3 Wheat.
546, 558-559 (1818). Courts of Appeals, too, have relied on
these liability limits in interpreting 42 U. S. C. $ 1981a. See,
e. g., Dudley v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 166 F. 3d 1317, 1322-

1323 (CA11 1999); Harris v. L & L Wings, Inc., 132 F. 3d
978, 983-985 (CA4 1997). See also Fitzgerald v. Mountain
States Telephone & Telegraph Co., 68 F. 3d 1257, 1263-1264
(CA10 1995) (same in suit under 42 U. S. C. $ 1981). But see
Deffenbaugh-Williams v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 156 F. 3d
581, 592-594 (CA5 1998), rehearing en banc ordered, 169
F. 3d 215 (1999).

We have observed that, "[i]n express terms, Congress has
directed federal courts to interpret Title VII based on
agency principles." Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth,
524 U. S. 742, 754 (1998); see also Meritor Savings Bank,
FSB v. Vinson, 477 U. S. 57, 72 (1986) (noting that, in interpreting Title VII, "Congress wanted courts to look to agency
principles for guidance"). Observing the limits on liability

542 KOLSTAD v. AMERICAN DENTAL ASSN.

Opinion of the Court
that these principles impose is especially important when interpreting the 1991 Act. In promulgating the Act, Congress
conspicuously left intact the "limits of employer liability" established in Meritor. Faragher v. Boca Raton, 524 U. S.
775, 804, n. 4 (1998); see also Burlington Industries, Inc.,
supra, at 763-764 ("[W]e are bound by our holding in Meritor that agency principles constrain the imposition of vicarious liability in cases of supervisory harassment").

Although jurisdictions disagree over whether and how
to limit vicarious liability for punitive damages, see, e. g., 2
J. Ghiardi & J. Kircher, Punitive Damages: Law and Practice

$ 24.01 (1998) (discussing disagreement); 22 Am. Jur. 2d,
Damages $ 788 (1988) (same), our interpretation of Title VII
is informed by "the general common law of agency, rather
than . . . the law of any particular State." Burlington Industries, Inc., supra, at 754 (internal quotation marks omitted). The common law as codified in the Restatement (Second) of Agency (1957), provides a useful starting point for
defining this general common law. See Burlington Industries, Inc., supra, at 755 ("[T]he Restatement . . . is a useful
beginning point for a discussion of general agency principles"); see also Meritor, supra, at 72. The Restatement of
Agency places strict limits on the extent to which an agent's
misconduct may be imputed to the principal for purposes of
awarding punitive damages:

"Punitive damages can properly be awarded against a
master or other principal because of an act by an agent
if, but only if:

"(a) the principal authorized the doing and the manner of the act, or

"(b) the agent was unfit and the principal was reckless
in employing him, or

"(c) the agent was employed in a managerial capacity
and was acting in the scope of employment, or

Opinion of the Court
"(d) the principal or a managerial agent of the princi-pal ratified or approved the act." Restatement (Second) of Agency, supra, $ 217 C.
See also Restatement (Second) of Torts $ 909 (same).The Restatement, for example, provides that the principal

may be liable for punitive damages if it authorizes or ratifiesthe agent's tortious act, or if it acts recklessly in employing
the malfeasing agent. The Restatement also contemplatesliability for punitive awards where an employee serving in
a "managerial capacity" committed the wrong while "actingin the scope of employment." Restatement (Second) of

"Unfortunately, no good definition of what constitutes a `managerial capacity' has beenfound," 2 Ghiardi, Punitive Damages, $ 24.05, at 14, and determining whether an employee meets this description re-quires a fact-intensive inquiry,

the employee, the amount of discretion that the employeehas in what is done and how it is accomplished." Id.,

$ 4.4(B)(2)(a), at 181. Suffice it to say here that the examplesprovided in the Restatement of Torts suggest that an employee must be "important," but perhaps need not be theemployer's "top management, officers, or directors," to be
acting "in a managerial capacity." Ibid.; see also 2 Ghiardi,

Additional questions arise from the meaning of the "scopeof employment" requirement. The Restatement of Agency
provides that even intentional torts are within the scope ofan agent's employment if the conduct is "the kind [the employee] is employed to perform," "occurs substantially withinthe authorized time and space limits," and "is actuated, at
least in part, by a purpose to serve the" employer. Restate527US2 Unit: $U86 [05-02-01 17:54:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ment (Second) of Agency, $ 228(1), at 504. According to theRestatement, so long as these rules are satisfied, an employee may be said to act within the scope of employmenteven if the employee engages in acts "specifically forbidden"
by the employer and uses "forbidden means of accomplishing
results." Id., $ 230, at 511, Comment b; see also Burlington
Industries, Inc., 524 U. S., at 756; Keeton, Torts $ 70. On
this view, even an employer who makes every effort to com-ply with Title VII would be held liable for the discriminatory

acts of agents acting in a "managerial capacity."Holding employers liable for punitive damages when they
engage in good faith efforts to comply with Title VII, however, is in some tension with the very principles underlying
common law limitations on vicarious liability for punitive
damages--that it is "improper ordinarily to award punitive
damages against one who himself is personally innocent and
therefore liable only vicariously." Restatement (Second) of
Torts, supra, $ 909, at 468, Comment b. Where an employer
has undertaken such good faith efforts at Title VII compliance, it "demonstrat[es] that it never acted in reckless disregard of federally protected rights." 139 F. 3d, at 974 (Tatel,
J., dissenting); see also Harris, 132 F. 3d, at 983, 984 (observing that, "[i]n some cases, the existence of a written policy
instituted in good faith has operated as a total bar to employer liability for punitive damages" and concluding that
"the institution of a written sexual harassment policy goes a
long way towards dispelling any claim about the employer's
`reckless' or `malicious' state of mind").

Applying the Restatement of Agency's "scope of employment" rule in the Title VII punitive damages context, moreover, would reduce the incentive for employers to implement
antidiscrimination programs. In fact, such a rule would
likely exacerbate concerns among employers that $ 1981a's
"malice" and "reckless indifference" standard penalizes those
employers who educate themselves and their employees on
Title VII's prohibitions. See Brief for Equal Employment

Opinion of the Court
Advisory Council as Amicus Curiae 12 ("[I]f an employerhas made efforts to familiarize itself with Title VII's requirements, then any violation of those requirements by theemployer can be inferred to have been committed `with malice or with reckless indifference' "). Dissuading employers
from implementing programs or policies to prevent discrimi-nation in the workplace is directly contrary to the purposes

underlying Title VII. The statute's "primary objective" is"a prophylactic one,"

Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422
U. S. 405, 417 (1975); it aims, chiefly, "not to provide redressbut to avoid harm,"

Faragher, 524 U. S., at 806. With regard to sexual harassment, "[f]or example, Title VII is designed to encourage the creation of antiharassment policies
and effective grievance mechanisms." Burlington Industries, Inc., 524 U. S., at 764. The purposes underlying Title
VII are similarly advanced where employers are encouraged
to adopt antidiscrimination policies and to educate their personnel on Title VII's prohibitions.

In light of the perverse incentives that the Restatement's
"scope of employment" rules create, we are compelled to
modify these principles to avoid undermining the objectives
underlying Title VII. See generally ibid. See also Faragher, supra, at 802, n. 3 (noting that Court must "adapt
agency concepts to the practical objectives of Title VII");
Meritor Savings Bank, FSB, 477 U. S., at 72 ("[C]ommonlaw principles may not be transferable in all their particulars
to Title VII"). Recognizing Title VII as an effort to promote prevention as well as remediation, and observing the
very principles underlying the Restatements' strict limits on
vicarious liability for punitive damages, we agree that, in the
punitive damages context, an employer may not be vicariously liable for the discriminatory employment decisions of
managerial agents where these decisions are contrary to the
employer's "good-faith efforts to comply with Title VII."

who make good-faith efforts to prevent discrimination in the
workplace accomplishes" Title VII's objective of "motivat[ing] employers to detect and deter Title VII violations."
Ibid.

We have concluded that an employer's conduct need not be
independently "egregious" to satisfy $ 1981a's requirements
for a punitive damages award, although evidence of egregious misconduct may be used to meet the plaintiff 's burden
of proof. We leave for remand the question whether petitioner can identify facts sufficient to support an inference
that the requisite mental state can be imputed to respondent.
The parties have not yet had an opportunity to marshal the
record evidence in support of their views on the application
of agency principles in the instant case, and the en banc majority had no reason to resolve the issue because it concluded
that petitioner had failed to demonstrate the requisite "egregious" misconduct. 139 F. 3d, at 968. Although trial testimony established that Allen made the ultimate decision to
promote Spangler while serving as petitioner's interim executive director, respondent's highest position, Tr. 159 (Oct. 19,
1995), it remains to be seen whether petitioner can make a
sufficient showing that Allen acted with malice or reckless
indifference to petitioner's Title VII rights. Even if it could
be established that Wheat effectively selected O'Donnell's
replacement, moreover, several questions would remain, e. g.,
whether Wheat was serving in a "managerial capacity" and
whether he behaved with malice or reckless indifference to
petitioner's rights. It may also be necessary to determine
whether the Association had been making good faith efforts
to enforce an antidiscrimination policy. We leave these issues for resolution on remand.

For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of
Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for proceedings
consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Chief Justice Rehnquist, with whom Justice Thomasjoins, concurring in part and dissenting in part.

For the reasons stated by Judge Randolph in his con-curring opinion in the Court of Appeals, I would hold that
Congress' two-tiered scheme of Title VII monetary liabilityimplies that there is an egregiousness requirement that reserves punitive damages only for the worst cases of inten-tional discrimination. See 139 F. 3d 958, 970 (CADC 1998).
Since the Court has determined otherwise, however, I joinPart I and that portion of Part II-B of the Court's opinion
holding that principles of agency law place a significant limi-tation, and in many foreseeable cases a complete bar, on employer liability for punitive damages.

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Souter, Justice
Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer join, concurring in part anddissenting in part.

The Court properly rejects the Court of Appeals' holdingthat defendants in Title VII actions must engage in "egregious" misconduct before a jury may be permitted to con-sider a request for punitive damages. Accordingly, I join
Parts I and II-A of its opinion. I write separately, however,because I strongly disagree with the Court's decision to volunteer commentary on an issue that the parties have notbriefed and that the facts of this case do not present. I
would simply remand for a trial on punitive damages.

In enacting the Civil Rights Act of 1991 (1991 Act), Con-gress established a three-tiered system of remedies for a

for disparate impact violations; compensatory damages for
intentional disparate treatment; and punitive damages for
intentional discrimination "with malice or with reckless indifference to the federally protected rights of an aggrieved
individual." $ 1981a(b)(1).

The 1991 Act's punitive damages standard, as the Court
recognizes, ante, at 535-536, is quite obviously drawn from
our holding in Smith v. Wade, 461 U. S. 30 (1983). There,
we held that punitive damages may be awarded under 42
U. S. C. $ 1983 (1976 ed., Supp. V) "when the defendant's conduct is shown to be motivated by evil motive or intent, or
when it involves reckless or callous indifference to the federally protected rights of others." 461 U. S., at 56.* The
1991 Act's standard is also the same intent-based standard
used in the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967
(ADEA), 29 U. S. C. $ 621 et seq. (1994 ed. and Supp. III).
The ADEA provides for an award of liquidated damages--
damages that are "punitive in nature," Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston, 469 U. S. 111, 125 (1985)--when the
employer "knew or showed reckless disregard for the matter
of whether its conduct was prohibited by the statute."
Hazen Paper Co. v. Biggins, 507 U. S. 604, 617 (1993); accord,
Thurston, 469 U. S., at 126.

*Lest there be any doubt that Congress looked to Smith in crafting the
statute, the Report of the House Judiciary Committee explains that the
"standard for punitive damages is taken directly from civil rights case
law," H. R. Rep. No. 102-40, pt. 2, p. 29 (1991), and proceeds to quote and
cite with approval the very page in Smith that announced the punitive
damages standard requiring "evil motive or intent, or . . . reckless or
callous indifference to the federally protected rights of others," 461 U. S.,
at 56, quoted in H. R. Rep. No. 102-40, at 29. The Report of the House
Education and Labor Committee echoed this sentiment. See H. R. Rep.
No. 102-40, p. 74 (1991) (citing Smith with approval). Congress' substitution in the 1991 Act of the word "malice" for Smith's phrase "evil motive
or intent" is inconsequential; in Smith, we noted that "malice . . . may be
an appropriate" term to denote ill will or an intent to injure. See 461
U. S., at 37, n. 6.

Opinion of Stevens, J.
In Smith, we carefully noted that our punitive damagesstandard separated the "quite distinct concepts of

intent to
cause injury, on one hand, and subjective consciousness ofrisk of injury (or of unlawfulness) on the other," 461 U. S., at

38, n. 6, and held that punitive damages are permissible only
when the latter component is satisfied by a deliberate orrecklessly indifferent violation of federal law. In

Thurston,
we interpreted the ADEA's standard the same way and ex-plained that the relevant mental distinction between intentional discrimination and "reckless disregard" for federallyprotected rights is essentially the same as the well-known
difference between a "knowing" and a "willful" violation of
a criminal law. See 469 U. S., at 126-127. While a criminal
defendant, like an employer, need not have knowledge of the
law to act "knowingly" or intentionally, he must know that
his acts violate the law or must "careless[ly] disregard
whether or not one has the right so to act" in order to act
"willfully." United States v. Murdock, 290 U. S. 389, 395
(1933), quoted in Thurston, 469 U. S., at 127. We have interpreted the word "willfully" the same way in the civil context.
See McLaughlin v. Richland Shoe Co., 486 U. S. 128, 133
(1988) (holding that the "plain language" of the Fair Labor
Standards Act's "willful" liquidated damages standard requires that "the employer either knew or showed reckless
disregard for the matter of whether its conduct was prohibited by the statute," without regard to the outrageousness
of the conduct at issue).

Construing $ 1981a(b)(1) to impose a purely mental standard is perfectly consistent with the structure and purpose of
the 1991 Act. As with the ADEA, the 1991 Act's "willful" or
"reckless disregard" standard respects the Act's "two-tiered"
damages scheme while deterring future intentionally unlawful discrimination. See Hazen Paper, 507 U. S., at 614-615.
There are, for reasons the Court explains, see ante, at 536-
537, numerous instances in which an employer might intentionally treat an individual differently because of her race,

Opinion of Stevens, J.
gender, religion, or disability without knowing that it is vio-lating Title VII or the ADA. In order to recover compensatory damages under the 1991 Act, victims of unlawful dispar-ate treatment must prove that the defendants'

conduct was
intentional, but they need not prove that the defendants
either knew or should have known that they were violating
the law. It is the additional element of willful or reckless
disregard of the law that justifies a penalty of double dam-ages in age discrimination cases and punitive damages in the

broad range of cases covered by the 1991 Act.It is of course true that as our society moves closer to the
goal of eliminating intentional, invidious discrimination, the
core mandates of Title VII and the ADA are becoming increasingly ingrained in employers' minds. As more employers come to appreciate the importance and the proportions
of those statutes' mandates, the number of federal violations
will continue to decrease accordingly. But at the same time,
one could reasonably believe, as Congress did, that as our
national resolve against employment discrimination hardens,
deliberate violations of Title VII and the ADA become increasingly blameworthy and more properly the subject of
"societal condemnation," McKennon v. Nashville Banner
Publishing Co., 513 U. S. 352, 357 (1995), in the form of punitive damages. Indeed, it would have been rather perverse
for Congress to conclude that the increasing acceptance of
antidiscrimination laws in the workplace somehow mitigates
willful violations of those laws such that only those violations
that are accompanied by particularly outlandish acts warrant
special deterrence.

Given the clarity of our cases and the precision of Congress' words, the common-law tradition of punitive damages
and any relationship it has to "egregious conduct" is quite
irrelevant. It is enough to say that Congress provided in
the 1991 Act its own punitive damages standard that focuses
solely on willful mental state, and it did not suggest that
there is any class of willful violations that are exempt from

Opinion of Stevens, J.
exposure to punitive damages. Nor did it indicate thatthere is a point on the spectrum of deliberate or recklessly

indifferent conduct that qualifies as "egregious." Thus,while behavior that merits that opprobrious label may provide probative evidence of wrongful motive, it is not a necessary prerequisite to proving such a motive under the 1991Act. To the extent that any treatise or federal, state, or

"common-law" case might suggest otherwise, it is wrong.There are other means of proving that an employer willfully violated the law. An employer, may, for example, ex-press hostility toward employment discrimination laws or
conceal evidence regarding its "true" selection procedures
because it knows they violate federal law. Whatever the
case, so long as a Title VII plaintiff proffers sufficient evidence from which a jury could conclude that an employer
acted willfully, judges have no place making their own value
judgments regarding whether the conduct was "egregious"
or otherwise presents an inappropriate candidate for punitive damages; the issue must go to the jury.

If we accept the jury's appraisal of the evidence in this
case and draw, as we must when reviewing the denial of a
jury instruction, all reasonable inferences in petitioner's
favor, there is ample evidence from which the jury could
have concluded that respondent willfully violated Title VII.
Petitioner emphasized, at trial and in her briefs to this
Court, that respondent took "a tangible employment action"
against her in the form of denying a promotion. Brief for
Petitioner 47. Evidence indicated that petitioner was the
more qualified of the two candidates for the job. Respondent's decisionmakers, who were senior executives of the Association, were known occasionally to tell sexually offensive
jokes and referred to professional women in derogatory
terms. The record further supports an inference that these
executives not only deliberately refused to consider petitioner fairly and to promote her because she is a woman,
but manipulated the job requirements and conducted a

"sham" selection procedure in an attempt to conceal theirmisconduct.

There is no claim that respondent's decisionmakers vio-lated any company policy; that they were not acting within
the scope of their employment; or that respondent has everdisavowed their conduct. Neither respondent nor its two
decisionmakers claimed at trial any ignorance of Title VII'srequirements, nor did either offer any "good-faith" reason for
believing that being a man was a legitimate requirement forthe job. Rather, at trial respondent resorted to false, pretextual explanations for its refusal to promote petitioner.The record, in sum, contains evidence from which a jury
might find that respondent acted with reckless indifferenceto petitioner's federally protected rights. It follows, in my
judgment, that the three-judge panel of the Court of Appealscorrectly decided to remand the case to the District Court
for a trial on punitive damages. See 108 F. 3d 1431, 1440(CADC 1997). To the extent that the Court's opinion fails
to direct that disposition, I respectfully dissent.

II
In Part II-B of its opinion, the Court discusses the ques-tion whether "[t]he plaintiff must impute liability for punitive

damages to respondent" under "agency principles." Ante,at 539. That is a question that neither of the parties has
ever addressed in this litigation and that respondent, atleast, has expressly disavowed. When prodded at oral argument, counsel for respondent twice stood firm on this point."[W]e all agree," he twice repeated, "that that precise issue
is not before the Court" Tr. of Oral Arg. 49. Nor did anyof the 11 judges in the Court of Appeals believe that it was
applicable to the dispute at hand--presumably because promotion decisions are quintessential "company acts," see 139F. 3d 958, 968 (CADC 1998), and because the two executives

who made this promotion decision were the executive direc527US2 Unit: $U86 [05-02-01 17:54:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN

tor of the Association and the acting head of its Washington
office. Id., at 974, 979 (Tatel, J., dissenting). See also 108
F. 3d, at 1434, 1439. Judge Tatel, who the Court implies
raised the agency issue, in fact explicitly (and correctly) concluded that "[t]his case does not present these or analogous
circumstances." 108 F. 3d, at 1439.

The absence of briefing or meaningful argument by the
parties makes this Court's gratuitous decision to volunteer
an opinion on this nonissue particularly ill advised. It is
not this Court's practice to consider arguments--specifically,
alternative defenses of the judgment under review--that
were not presented in the brief in opposition to the petition
for certiorari. See this Court's Rule 15.2. Indeed, on two
occasions in this very Term, we refused to do so despite the
fact that the issues were briefed and argued by the parties.
See South Central Bell Telephone Co. v. Alabama, 526 U. S.
160, 171 (1999); Roberts v. Galen of Va., Inc., 525 U. S. 249,
253-254 (1999) (per curiam). If we declined to reach alternative defenses under those circumstances, surely we should
do so here.

Nor is it accurate for the Court to imply that the Solicitor
General, representing Government amici, advocates a course
similar to that which the Court takes regarding the agency
question. Cf. ante, at 540. The Solicitor General, like the
parties, did not brief any agency issue. At oral argument,
he correspondingly stated that the issue "is not really presented here." Tr. of Oral Arg. 19. He then responded to
the Court's questions by stating that the Federal Government believes that whenever a tangible employment consequence is involved $ 1981a incorporates the "managerial capacity" principles espoused by $ 217 C of the Restatement
(Second) of Agency. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 23. But to the
extent that the Court tinkers with the Restatement's standard, it is rejecting the Government's view of its own statute
without giving it an opportunity to be heard on the issue.

ALBERTSON'S, INC. v. KIRKINGBURG
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 98-591. Argued April 28, 1999--Decided June 22, 1999
Before beginning a truckdriver's job with petitioner, Albertson's, Inc.,

in 1990, respondent, Kirkingburg, was examined to see if he met the
Department of Transportation's basic vision standards for commercial
truckdrivers, which require corrected distant visual acuity of at least
20/40 in each eye and distant binocular acuity of at least 20/40. Although he has amblyopia, an uncorrectable condition that leaves him
with 20/200 vision in his left eye and thus effectively monocular vision,
the doctor erroneously certified that he met the DOT standards. When
his vision was correctly assessed at a 1992 physical, he was told that
he had to get a waiver of the DOT standards under a waiver program
begun that year. Albertson's, however, fired him for failing to meet
the basic DOT vision standards and refused to rehire him after he received a waiver. Kirkingburg sued Albertson's, claiming that firing
him violated the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA). In
granting summary judgment for Albertson's, the District Court found
that Kirkingburg was not qualified without an accommodation because
he could not meet the basic DOT standards and that the waiver program
did not alter those standards. The Ninth Circuit reversed, finding that
Kirkingburg had established a disability under the Act by demonstrating that the manner in which he sees differs significantly from the manner in which most people see; that although the ADA allowed Albertson's to rely on Government regulations in setting a job-related vision
standard, Albertson's could not use compliance with the DOT regulations to justify its requirement because the waiver program was a legitimate part of the DOT's regulatory scheme; and that although Albertson's could set a vision standard different from the DOT's, it had to
justify its independent standard and could not do so here.

Held:

1. The ADA requires monocular individuals, like others claiming the
Act's protection, to prove a disability by offering evidence that the
extent of the limitation on a major life activity caused by their impairment is substantial. The Ninth Circuit made three missteps in
determining that Kirkingburg's amblyopia meets the ADA's first definition of disability, i. e., a physical or mental impairment that "substantially limits" a major life activity, 42 U. S. C. $ 12101(2)(A). First,

527US2 Unit: $U87 [05-09-01 13:04:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN
556 ALBERTSON'S, INC. v. KIRKINGBURG

Syllabus
although it relied on an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
regulation that defines "substantially limits" as requiring a "significant
restrict[ion]" in an individual's manner of performing a major life activity, see 29 CFR $ 1630.2(j)(ii), the court actually found that there was
merely a significant "difference" between the manner in which Kirkingburg sees and the manner in which most people see. By transforming
"significant restriction" into "difference," the court undercut the fundamental statutory requirement that only impairments that substantially
limit the ability to perform a major life activity constitute disabilities.
Second, the court appeared to suggest that it need not take account
of a monocular individual's ability to compensate for the impairment,
even though it acknowledged that Kirkingburg's brain had subconsciously done just that. Mitigating measures, however, must be taken
into account in judging whether an individual has a disability, Sutton v.
United Airlines, Inc., ante, at 482, whether the measures taken are with
artificial aids, like medications and devices, or with the body's own systems. Finally, the Ninth Circuit did not pay much heed to the statutory
obligation to determine a disability's existence on a case-by-case basis.
See 42 U. S. C. $ 12101(2). Some impairments may invariably cause a
substantial limitation of a major life activity, but monocularity is not
one of them, for that category embraces a group whose members vary
by, e. g., the degree of visual acuity in the weaker eye, the extent of their
compensating adjustments, and the ultimate scope of the restrictions on
their visual abilities. Pp. 562-567.

2. An employer who requires as a job qualification that an employee
meet an otherwise applicable federal safety regulation does not have
to justify enforcing the regulation solely because its standard may be
waived experimentally in an individual case. Pp. 567-578.

(a) Petitioner's job qualification was not of its own devising, but
was the visual acuity standard of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations, and is binding on Albertson's, see 49 CFR $ 391.11. The validity of these regulations is unchallenged, they have the force of law, and
they contain no qualifying language about individualized determinations. Were it not for the waiver program, there would be no basis for
questioning petitioner's decision, and right, to follow the regulations.
Pp. 567-570.

(b) The regulations establishing the waiver program did not modify
the basic visual acuity standard in a way that disentitles an employer
like Albertson's to insist on the basic standard. One might assume that
the general regulatory standard and the regulatory waiver standard
ought to be accorded equal substantive significance, but that is not the
case here. In setting the basic standards, the Federal Highway Admin527US2 Unit: $U87 [05-09-01 13:04:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Syllabus
istration, the DOT agency responsible for overseeing the motor carrier
safety regulations, made a considered determination about the visual
acuity level needed for safe operation of commercial motor vehicles in
interstate commerce. In contrast, the regulatory record made it plain
that the waiver program at issue in this case was simply an experiment
proposed as a means of obtaining data, resting on a hypothesis whose
confirmation or refutation would provide a factual basis for possibly relaxing existing standards. Pp. 570-576.

(c) The ADA should not be read to require an employer to defend
its decision not to participate in such an experiment. It is simply not
credible that Congress enacted the ADA with the understanding that
employers choosing to respect the Government's visual acuity regulation in the face of an experimental waiver might be burdened with
an obligation to defend the regulation's application according to its own
terms. Pp. 577-578.

558 ALBERTSON'S, INC. v. KIRKINGBURG

Opinion of the Court
Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court.*
The question posed is whether, under the Americans withDisabilities Act of 1990 (ADA or Act), 104 Stat. 327, as

amended, 42 U. S. C. $ 12101 et seq. (1994 ed. and Supp. III),an employer who requires as a job qualification that an employee meet an otherwise applicable federal safety regula-tion must justify enforcing the regulation solely because its
standard may be waived in an individual case. We answerno.

I
In August 1990, petitioner, Albertson's, Inc., a grocery-store chain with supermarkets in several States, hired respondent, Hallie Kirkingburg, as a truckdriver based atits Portland, Oregon, warehouse. Kirkingburg had more
than a decade's driving experience and performed well whenpetitioner's transportation manager took him on a road test.

Before starting work, Kirkingburg was examined to seeif he met federal vision standards for commercial truckdrivers. 143 F. 3d 1228, 1230-1231 (CA9 1998). For manydecades the Department of Transportation and its predecessors have been responsible for devising these standards forindividuals who drive commercial vehicles in interstate commerce.1 Since 1971, the basic vision regulation has requiredcorrected distant visual acuity of at least 20/40 in each eye

CFR $ 391.41(b)(10) (1998).2 Kirkingburg, however, suffersfrom amblyopia, an uncorrectable condition that leaves him
with 20/200 vision in his left eye and monocular vision ineffect.

3 Despite Kirkingburg's weak left eye, the doctor erroneously certified that he met the DOT's basic vision stand-ards, and Albertson's hired him.

4

In December 1991, Kirkingburg injured himself on the joband took a leave of absence. Before returning to work in

November 1992, Kirkingburg went for a further physical asrequired by the company. This time, the examining physician correctly assessed Kirkingburg's vision and explainedthat his eyesight did not meet the basic DOT standards.
The physician, or his nurse, told Kirkingburg that in orderto be legally qualified to drive, he would have to obtain a
waiver of its basic vision standards from the DOT. See 143

2 Visual acuity has a number of components but most commonly refers
to "the ability to determine the presence of or to distinguish between
more than one identifying feature in a visible target." G. von Noorden,
Binocular Vision and Ocular Motility 114 (4th ed. 1990). Herman Snellen
was a Dutch ophthalmologist who, in 1862, devised the familiar letter
chart still used to measure visual acuity. The first figure in the Snellen
score refers to distance between the viewer and the visual target, typically 20 feet. The second corresponds to the distance at which a person
with normal acuity could distinguish letters of the size that the viewer
can distinguish at 20 feet. See C. Snyder, Our Ophthalmic Heritage 97-99
(1967); D. Vaughan, T. Asburg, & P. Riordan-Eva, General Ophthalmology
30 (15th ed. 1999).

3 "Amblyopia," derived from Greek roots meaning dull vision, is a general medical term for "poor vision caused by abnormal visual development
secondary to abnormal visual stimulation." K. Wright et al., Pediatric
Ophthalmology and Strabismus 126 (1995); see id., at 126-131; see also Von
Noorden, supra, at 208-245.

4 Several months later, Kirkingburg's vision was recertified by a physician, again erroneously. Both times Kirkingburg received certification
although his vision as measured did not meet the DOT minimum requirement. See 143 F. 3d 1228, 1230, and n. 2 (CA9 1998); App. 49-50,

560 ALBERTSON'S, INC. v. KIRKINGBURG

Opinion of the Court
F. 3d, at 1230; App. 284-285. The doctor was alluding to ascheme begun in July 1992 for giving DOT certification to

applicants with deficient vision who had three years of recentexperience driving a commercial vehicle without a license
suspension or revocation, involvement in a reportable ac-cident in which the applicant was cited for a moving violation, conviction for certain driving-related offenses, citationfor certain serious traffic violations, or more than two convictions for any other moving violations. A waiver appli-cant had to agree to have his vision checked annually for
deterioration, and to report certain information about hisdriving experience to the Federal Highway Administration
(FHWA or Administration), the agency within the DOT re-sponsible for overseeing the motor carrier safety regulations.
See 57 Fed. Reg. 31458, 31460-31461 (1992).5 Kirkingburgapplied for a waiver, but because he could not meet the basic
DOT vision standard Albertson's fired him from his job as atruckdriver.

6 In early 1993, after he had left Albertson's,

Kirkingburg received a DOT waiver, but Albertson's refusedto rehire him. See 143 F. 3d, at 1231.

Kirkingburg sued Albertson's, claiming that firing him vio-lated the ADA.

7 Albertson's moved for summary judgment

5 In February 1992, the FHWA issued an advance notice of proposed
rulemaking to review its vision standards. See 57 Fed. Reg. 6793.
Shortly thereafter, the FHWA announced its intent to set up a waiver
program and its preliminary acceptance of waiver applications. See id.,
at 10295. It modified the proposed conditions for the waivers and requested comments in June. See id., at 23370. After receiving and considering the comments, the Administration announced its final decision
to grant waivers in July.

6 Albertson's offered Kirkingburg at least one and possibly two alternative jobs. The first was as a "yard hostler," a truckdriver within the
premises of petitioner's warehouse property, the second as a tire mechanic.
The company apparently withdrew the first offer, though the parties dispute the exact sequence of events. Kirkingburg turned down the second
because it paid much less than driving a truck. See App. 14-16, 41-42.

7 The ADA provides: "No covered entity shall discriminate against a

qualified individual with a disability because of the disability of such individual in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement,

527US2 Unit: $U87 [05-09-01 13:04:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN

561Cite as: 527 U. S. 555 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
solely on the ground that Kirkingburg was "not `otherwisequalified' to perform the job of truck driver with or without

reasonable accommodation." App. 39-40; see id., at 119.The District Court granted the motion, ruling that Albertson's had reasonably concluded that Kirkingburg was not
qualified without an accommodation because he could not, asadmitted, meet the basic DOT vision standards. The court

held that giving Kirkingburg time to get a DOT waiver was
not a required reasonable accommodation because the waiver
program was "a flawed experiment that has not altered the
DOT vision requirements." Id., at 120.

A divided panel of the Ninth Circuit reversed. In addition to pressing its claim that Kirkingburg was not otherwise
qualified, Albertson's for the first time on appeal took the
position that it was entitled to summary judgment because
Kirkingburg did not have a disability within the meaning
of the Act. See id., at 182-185. The Court of Appeals considered but rejected the new argument, concluding that
because Kirkingburg had presented "uncontroverted evidence" that his vision was effectively monocular, he had demonstrated that "the manner in which he sees differs significantly from the manner in which most people see." 143 F.
3d, at 1232. That difference in manner, the court held, was
sufficient to establish disability. Ibid.

The Court of Appeals then addressed the ground upon
which the District Court had granted summary judgment,
acknowledging that Albertson's consistently required its
truckdrivers to meet the DOT's basic vision standards and
that Kirkingburg had not met them (and indeed could not).
The court recognized that the ADA allowed Albertson's to
establish a reasonable job-related vision standard as a prerequisite for hiring and that Albertson's could rely on Government regulations as a basis for setting its standard. The
court held, however, that Albertson's could not use complior discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other
terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." 42 U. S. C. $ 12112(a).

562 ALBERTSON'S, INC. v. KIRKINGBURG

Opinion of the Court
ance with a Government regulation as the justification for
its vision requirement because the waiver program, which
Albertson's disregarded, was "a lawful and legitimate part
of the DOT regulatory scheme." Id., at 1236. The Court
of Appeals conceded that Albertson's was free to set a vision
standard different from that mandated by the DOT, but
held that under the ADA, Albertson's would have to justify its independent standard as necessary to prevent " `a
direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals
in the workplace.' " Ibid. (quoting 42 U. S. C. $ 12113(b)).
Although the court suggested that Albertson's might be able
to make such a showing on remand, 143 F. 3d, at 1236, it
ultimately took the position that the company could not,
interpreting petitioner's rejection of DOT waivers as flying
in the face of the judgment about safety already embodied
in the DOT's decision to grant them, id., at 1237.

Judge Rymer dissented. She contended that Albertson's
had properly relied on the basic DOT vision standards in
refusing to accept waivers because, when Albertson's fired
Kirkingburg, the waiver program did not rest upon "a rule
or a regulation with the force of law," but was merely a way
of gathering data to use in deciding whether to refashion the
still-applicable vision standards. Id., at 1239.

II
Though we need not speak to the issue whether Kirkingburg was an individual with a disability in order to resolve this case, that issue falls within the first question on
which we granted certiorari,8 525 U. S. 1064 (1999), and we
think it worthwhile to address it briefly in order to correct
three missteps the Ninth Circuit made in its discussion of
the matter. Under the ADA:

8 "Whether a monocular individual is `disabled' per se, under the Americans with Disabilities Act." Pet. for Cert. i (citation omitted).

527US2 Unit: $U87 [05-09-01 13:04:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN

563Cite as: 527 U. S. 555 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
"The term `disability' means, with respect to anindividual--

"(A) a physical or mental impairment that substan-tially limits one or more of the major life activities of
such individual;"(B) a record of such an impairment; or

"(C) being regarded as having such an impairment."42 U. S. C. $ 12102(2).

We are concerned only with the first definition.9 There isno dispute either that Kirkingburg's amblyopia is a physical impairment within the meaning of the Act, see 29 CFR$ 1630.2(h)(1) (1998) (defining "physical impairment" as "[a]ny
physiological disorder, or condition . . . affecting one or moreof the following body systems: . . . special sense organs"), or
that seeing is one of his major life activities, see $ 1630.2(i)(giving seeing as an example of a major life activity).

10 The

question is whether his monocular vision alone "substantiallylimits" Kirkingburg's seeing.

In giving its affirmative answer, the Ninth Circuit re-lied on a regulation issued by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), defining "substantially lim-its" as "[s]ignificantly restrict[s] as to the condition, manner
or duration under which an individual can perform a partic-ular major life activity as compared to the condition, manner, or duration under which the average person in the gen9 The Ninth Circuit also discussed whether Kirkingburg was disabled
under the third, "regarded as," definition of "disability." See 143 F. 3d,
at 1233. Albertson's did not challenge that aspect of the Court of Appeals's decision in its petition for certiorari, and we therefore do not address it. See this Court's Rule 14.1(a); see also, e. g., Yee v. Escondido,
503 U. S. 519, 535 (1992).

10 As the parties have not questioned the regulations and interpretive

guidance promulgated by the EEOC relating to the ADA's definitional
section, 42 U. S. C. $ 12102, for the purposes of this case, we assume, without deciding, that such regulations are valid, and we have no occasion to
decide what level of deference, if any, they are due, see Sutton v. United
Airlines, Inc., ante, at 479-480.

Opinion of the Court
eral population can perform that same major life activity."$ 1630.2( j)(ii). The Ninth Circuit concluded that "the manner in which [Kirkingburg] sees differs significantly from themanner in which most people see" because, "[t]o put it in its
simplest terms [he] sees using only one eye; most people see
using two." 143 F. 3d, at 1232. The Ninth Circuit majorityalso relied on a recent Eighth Circuit decision, whose holding

it characterized in similar terms: "It was enough to warranta finding of disability . . . that the plaintiff could see out of
only one eye: the manner in which he performed the majorlife activity of seeing was different."

Ibid. (characterizing
Doane v. Omaha, 115 F. 3d 624, 627-628 (1997)).11But in several respects the Ninth Circuit was too quick

to find a disability. First, although the EEOC definition

11 Before the Ninth Circuit, Albertson's presented the issue of Kirkingburg's failure to meet the Act's definition of disability as an alternative
ground for affirmance, i. e., for a grant of summary judgment in the company's favor. It thus contended that Kirkingburg had "failed to produce any material issue of fact" that he was disabled. App. 182. Parts
of the Ninth Circuit's discussion suggest that it was merely denying the
company's request for summary judgment, leaving the issue open for factual development and resolution on remand. See, e. g., 143 F. 3d, at 1232
("Albertson's first contends that Kirkingburg failed to raise a genuine issue
of fact regarding whether he is disabled"); ibid. ("Kirkingburg has presented uncontroverted evidence showing that . . . [his] inability to see out
of one eye affects his peripheral vision and his depth perception"); ibid.
("if the facts are as Kirkingburg alleges"). Moreover the Government
(and at times even Albertson's, see Pet. for Cert. 15) understands the
Ninth Circuit to have been simply explaining why the company was not
entitled to summary judgment on this score. See Brief for United States
et al. as Amici Curiae 11, and n. 5 ("The Ninth Circuit therefore correctly
declined to grant summary judgment to petitioner on the ground that
monocular vision is not a disability"). Even if that is an accurate reading,
the statements the Ninth Circuit made setting out the standards governing the finding of disability would have largely dictated the outcome.
Whether one views the Ninth Circuit's opinion as merely denying summary judgment for the company or as tantamount to a grant of summary
judgment for Kirkingburg, our rejection of the sweeping character of the
Court of Appeals's pronouncements remains the same.

Opinion of the Court
of "substantially limits" cited by the Ninth Circuit requiresa "significant restrict[ion]" in an individual's manner of

performing a major life activity, the court appeared willingto settle for a mere difference. By transforming "significant
restriction" into "difference," the court undercut the fundamental statutory requirement that only impairments causing"substantial limitat[ions]" in individuals' ability to perform

major life activities constitute disabilities. While the Act"addresses substantial limitations on major life activities,
not utter inabilities," Bragdon v. Abbott, 524 U. S. 624, 641(1998), it concerns itself only with limitations that are in
fact substantial.

Second, the Ninth Circuit appeared to suggest that in
gauging whether a monocular individual has a disability a
court need not take account of the individual's ability to compensate for the impairment. The court acknowledged that
Kirkingburg's "brain has developed subconscious mechanisms for coping with [his] visual impairment and thus his
body compensates for his disability." 143 F. 3d, at 1232.
But in treating monocularity as itself sufficient to establish
disability and in embracing Doane, the Ninth Circuit apparently adopted the view that whether "the individual had
learned to compensate for the disability by making subconscious adjustments to the manner in which he sensed
depth and perceived peripheral objects," 143 F. 3d, at 1232,
was irrelevant to the determination of disability. See, e. g.,
Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., 130 F. 3d 893, 901, n. 7
(CA10 1997) (characterizing Doane as standing for the proposition that mitigating measures should be disregarded in assessing disability); EEOC v. Union Pacific R. Co., 6 F. Supp.
2d 1135, 1137 (Idaho 1998) (same). We have just held, however, in Sutton v. United Airlines, Inc., ante, at 482, that
mitigating measures must be taken into account in judging
whether an individual possesses a disability. We see no
principled basis for distinguishing between measures undertaken with artificial aids, like medications and devices, and

Opinion of the Court
measures undertaken, whether consciously or not, with thebody's own systems.

Finally, and perhaps most significantly, the Court of Ap-peals did not pay much heed to the statutory obligation to
determine the existence of disabilities on a case-by-casebasis. The Act expresses that mandate clearly by defining
"disability" "with respect to an individual," 42 U. S. C.$ 12102(2), and in terms of the impact of an impairment on
"such individual," $ 12102(2)(A). See Sutton, ante, at 483;cf. 29 CFR pt. 1630, App. $ 1630.2( j) (1998) ("The determination of whether an individual has a disability is not necessar-ily based on the name or diagnosis of the impairment the
person has, but rather on the effect of that impairment onthe life of the individual"); ibid. ("The determination of
whether an individual is substantially limited in a major lifeactivity must be made on a case by case basis"). While
some impairments may invariably cause a substantial limita-tion of a major life activity, cf. Bragdon, supra, at 642 (declining to address whether HIV infection is a per se disability),we cannot say that monocularity does. That category, as we
understand it, may embrace a group whose members varyby the degree of visual acuity in the weaker eye, the age
at which they suffered their vision loss, the extent of theircompensating adjustments in visual techniques, and the
ultimate scope of the restrictions on their visual abilities.These variables are not the stuff of a

per se rule. Whilemonocularity inevitably leads to some loss of horizontal field

of vision and depth perception,12 consequences the Ninth

12 Individuals who can see out of only one eye are unable to perform
stereopsis, the process of combining two retinal images into one through
which two-eyed individuals gain much of their depth perception, particularly at short distances. At greater distances, stereopsis is relatively
less important for depth perception. In their distance vision, monocular
individuals are able to compensate for their lack of stereopsis to varying
degrees by relying on monocular cues, such as motion parallax, linear perspective, overlay of contours, and distribution of highlights and shadows.

Opinion of the Court
Circuit mentioned, see 143 F. 3d, at 1232, the court did notidentify the degree of loss suffered by Kirkingburg, nor are

we aware of any evidence in the record specifying the extentof his visual restrictions.

This is not to suggest that monocular individuals have anonerous burden in trying to show that they are disabled.
On the contrary, our brief examination of some of the medi-cal literature leaves us sharing the Government's judgment
that people with monocular vision "ordinarily" will meet theAct's definition of disability, Brief for United States et al. as
Amici Curiae 11, and we suppose that defendant companieswill often not contest the issue. We simply hold that the
Act requires monocular individuals, like others claiming theAct's protection, to prove a disability by offering evidence
that the extent of the limitation in terms of their own ex-perience, as in loss of depth perception and visual field, is
substantial. III

Petitioner's primary contention is that even if Kirking-burg was disabled, he was not a "qualified" individual with
a disability, see 42 U. S. C. $ 12112(a), because Albertson'smerely insisted on the minimum level of visual acuity set
forth in the DOT's Motor Carrier Safety Regulations, 49CFR $ 391.41(b)(10) (1998). If Albertson's was entitled to
enforce that standard as defining an "essential job functio[n]of the employment position," see 42 U. S. C. $ 12111(8), that
is the end of the case, for Kirkingburg concededly could notsatisfy it.

13

13 Kirkingburg asserts that in showing that Albertson's initially allowed
him to drive with a DOT certification, despite the fact that he did not
meet the DOT's minimum visual acuity requirement, he produced evidence
from which a reasonable juror could find that he satisfied the legitimate
prerequisites of the job. See Brief for Respondent 36, 37; see also id., at
6. But petitioner's argument is a legal, not a factual, one. In any event,
the ample evidence in the record on petitioner's policy of requiring adherence to minimum DOT vision standards for its truckdrivers, see, e. g.,

568 ALBERTSON'S, INC. v. KIRKINGBURG

Opinion of the Court
Under Title I of the ADA, employers may justify their use
of "qualification standards . . . that screen out or tend to
screen out or otherwise deny a job or benefit to an individual
with a disability," so long as such standards are "job-related
and consistent with business necessity, and . . . performance
cannot be accomplished by reasonable accommodation . . . ."

$ 12113(a). See also $ 12112(b)(6) (defining discrimination to
include "using qualification standards . . . that screen out or
tend to screen out an individual with a disability . . . unless
the standard . . . is shown to be job-related for the position
in question and is consistent with business necessity").14

Kirkingburg and the Government argue that these provisions do not authorize an employer to follow even a facially applicable regulatory standard subject to waiver without making some enquiry beyond determining whether the
applicant or employee meets that standard, yes or no. Before an employer may insist on compliance, they say, the
employer must make a showing with reference to the particular job that the waivable regulatory standard is "jobrelated . . . and . . . consistent with business necessity," see

$ 12112(b)(6), and that after consideration of the capabilities of the individual a reasonable accommodation could not
fairly resolve the competing interests when an applicant or
employee cannot wholly satisfy an otherwise justifiable job
qualification.

App. 53, 55-56, 333, would bar any inference that petitioner's failure to
detect the discrepancy between the level of visual acuity Kirkingburg was
determined to have had during his first two certifications and the DOT's
minimum visual acuity requirement raised a genuine factual dispute on
this issue.

14 The EEOC's regulations implementing Title I define "[q]ualification

standards" to mean "the personal and professional attributes including
the skill, experience, education, physical, medical, safety and other requirements established by a covered entity as requirements which an individual must meet in order to be eligible for the position held or desired."
29 CFR $ 1630.2(q) (1998).

569Cite as: 527 U. S. 555 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
The Government extends this argument by reference toa further section of the statute, which at first blush appears

to be a permissive provision for the employer's and the pub-lic's benefit. An employer may impose as a qualification
standard "a requirement that an individual shall not posea direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals
in the workplace," $ 12113(b), with "direct threat" being de-fined by the Act as "a significant risk to the health or safety
of others that cannot be eliminated by reasonable accommo-dation," $ 12111(3); see also 29 CFR $ 1630.2(r) (1998). The
Government urges us to read subsections (a) and (b) togetherto mean that when an employer would impose any safety
qualification standard, however specific, tending to screenout individuals with disabilities, the application of the requirement must satisfy the ADA's "direct threat" criterion,see Brief for United States et al. as

Amici Curiae 22. That
criterion ordinarily requires "an individualized assessmentof the individual's present ability to safely perform the essential functions of the job," 29 CFR $ 1630.2(r) (1998),
"based on medical or other objective evidence," Bragdon, 524U. S., at 649 (citing

School Bd. of Nassau Cty. v. Arline, 480
U. S. 273, 288 (1987)); see 29 CFR $ 1630.2(r) (1998) (assess-ment of direct threat "shall be based on a reasonable medical

judgment that relies on the most current medical knowledgeand/or on the best available objective evidence").

15

15 This appears to be the position taken by the EEOC in the Interpretive Guidance promulgated under its authority to issue regulations to
carry out Title I of the ADA, 42 U. S. C. $ 12116, see 29 CFR pt. 1630,
App. $$ 1630.15(b) and (c) (1998) (requiring safety-related standards to be
evaluated under the ADA's direct threat standard); see also App. $ 1630.10
(noting that selection criteria that screen out individuals with disabilities,
including "safety requirements, vision or hearing requirements," must be
job-related, consistent with business necessity, and not amenable to reasonable accommodation); EEOC v. Exxon Corp., 1 F. Supp. 2d 635, 645

Opinion of the Court
Albertson's answers essentially that even assuming the
Government has proposed a sound reading of the statute for
the general run of cases, this case is not in the general run.
It is crucial to its position that Albertson's here was not insisting upon a job qualification merely of its own devising,
subject to possible questions about genuine appropriateness and justifiable application to an individual for whom
some accommodation may be reasonable. The job qualification it was applying was the distant visual acuity standard
of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations, 49 CFR

$ 391.41(b)(10) (1998), which is made binding on Albertson's
by $ 391.11: "[A] motor carrier shall not . . . permit a person
to drive a commercial motor vehicle unless that person is
qualified to drive," by, among other things, meeting the
physical qualification standards set forth in $ 391.41. The
validity of these regulations is unchallenged, they have the
force of law, and they contain no qualifying language about
individualized determinations.

If we looked no further, there would be no basis to question petitioner's unconditional obligation to follow the regulations and its consequent right to do so. This, indeed, was
the understanding of Congress when it enacted the ADA, see
infra, at 573-574.16 But there is more: the waiver program.

The Court of Appeals majority concluded that the waiver
program "precludes [employers] from declaring that persons
determined by DOT to be capable of performing the job of
commercial truck driver are incapable of performing that job
by virtue of their disability," and that in the face of a waiver

might impose a higher burden on employers to justify safety-related qualification standards than other job requirements, is a sound one, we have no
need to confront the validity of the reading in this case.

16 The implementing regulations of Title I also recognize a defense to

liability under the ADA that "a challenged action is required or necessitated by another Federal law or regulation," 29 CFR $ 1630.15(e) (1998).
As the parties do not invoke this specific regulation, we have no occasion
to consider its effect.

Opinion of the Court
an employer "will not be able to avoid the [ADA's] stricturesby showing that its standards are necessary to prevent a

direct safety threat," 143 F. 3d, at 1237. The Court of Ap-peals thus assumed that the regulatory provisions for the
waiver program had to be treated as being on par with the
basic visual acuity regulation, as if the general rule had beenmodified by some different safety standard made applicable

by grant of a waiver. Cf. Conroy v. Aniskoff, 507 U. S. 511,515 (1993) (noting the " `cardinal rule that a statute is to be
read as a whole' " (quoting King v. St. Vincent's Hospital,502 U. S. 215, 221 (1991))). On this reading, an individualized determination under a different substantive safety rule
was an element of the regulatory regime, which would easily
fit with any requirement of 42 U. S. C. $$ 12113(a) and (b) to
consider reasonable accommodation. An employer resting
solely on the federal standard for its visual acuity qualification would be required to accept a waiver once obtained,
and probably to provide an applicant some opportunity to
obtain a waiver whenever that was reasonably possible. If
this was sound analysis, the District Court's summary judgment for Albertson's was error.

But the reasoning underlying the Court of Appeals's decision was unsound, for we think it was error to read the regulations establishing the waiver program as modifying the
content of the basic visual acuity standard in a way that disentitled an employer like Albertson's to insist on it. To be
sure, this is not immediately apparent. If one starts with
the statutory provisions authorizing regulations by the DOT
as they stood at the time the DOT began the waiver program, one would reasonably presume that the general regulatory standard and the regulatory waiver standard ought to
be accorded equal substantive significance, so that the content of any general regulation would as a matter of law be
deemed modified by the terms of any waiver standard thus
applied to it. Compare 49 U. S. C. App. $ 2505(a)(3) (1988
ed.) ("Such regulation shall . . . ensure that . . . the physical

49 U. S. C. App. $ 2505(f ) (1988 ed.) ("After notice and an op-portunity for comment, the Secretary may waive, in whole

or in part, application of any regulation issued under thissection with respect to any person or class of persons if the
Secretary determines that such waiver is not contrary to thepublic interest and is consistent with the safe operation of
commercial motor vehicles").18 Safe operation is supposedto be the touchstone of regulation in each instance.

As to the general visual acuity regulations in force underthe former provision,

19 affirmative determinations that the

selected standards were needed for safe operation were in-deed the predicates of the DOT action. Starting in 1937,

the federal agencies authorized to regulate commercialmotor vehicle safety set increasingly rigorous visual acuity
standards, culminating in the current one, which has re-mained unchanged since it became effective in 1971.

20 When

17 This provision is currently codified at 49 U. S. C. $ 31136(a)(3).
18 Congress recently amended the waiver provision in the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, Pub. L. 105-178, 112 Stat. 107. It
now provides that the Secretary of Transportation may issue a 2-year
renewable "exemption" if "such exemption would likely achieve a level
of safety that is equivalent to, or greater than, the level that would be
achieved absent such exemption." See $ 4007, 112 Stat. 401, 49 U. S. C.

$ 31315(b) (1994 ed., Supp. IV).

19 At the time the FHWA promulgated the current visual acuity standard, the agency was acting pursuant to $ 204(a) of the Interstate Commerce Act, as amended by the Motor Carrier Act, 49 U. S. C. $ 304(a) (1970
ed.), see n. 1, supra, which likewise required the agency to regulate to
ensure "safety of operation."

20 The Interstate Commerce Commission promulgated the first visual

acuity regulations for interstate commercial drivers in 1937, requiring
"[g]ood eyesight in both eyes (either with or without glasses, or by correction with glasses), including adequate perception of red and green
colors." 2 Fed. Reg. 113120 (1937). In 1939, the vision standard was
changed to require "visual acuity (either without glasses or by correction with glasses) of not less than 20/40 (Snellen) in one eye, and 20/100
(Snellen) in the other eye; form field of not less than 45 degrees in all
meridians from the point of fixation; ability to distinguish red, green,

Opinion of the Court
the FHWA proposed it, the agency found that "[a]ccident ex-perience in recent years has demonstrated that reduction of

the effects of organic and physical disorders, emotional im-pairments, and other limitations of the good health of drivers
are increasingly important factors in accident prevention,"34 Fed. Reg. 9080, 9081 (1969) (Notice of Proposed Rule
Making); the current standard was adopted to reflect theagency's conclusion that "drivers of modern, more complex
vehicles" must be able to "withstand the increased physi-cal and mental demands that their occupation now imposes."
35 Fed. Reg. 6458 (1970). Given these findings and "in thelight of discussions with the Administration's medical advisers," id., at 6459, the FHWA made a considered determina-tion about the level of visual acuity needed for safe operation
of commercial motor vehicles in interstate commerce, an"area [in which] the risks involved are so well known and
so serious as to dictate the utmost caution." Id., at 17419.For several reasons, one would expect any regulation
governing a waiver program to establish a comparable sub-stantive standard (albeit for exceptional cases), grounded
on known facts indicating at least that safe operation wouldnot be jeopardized. First, of course, safe operation was the
criterion of the statute authorizing an administrative waiverscheme, as noted already. Second, the impetus to develop a
waiver program was a concern that the existing substantivestandard might be more demanding than safety required.
When Congress enacted the ADA, it recognized that federalsafety rules would limit application of the ADA as a matter
of law. The Senate Labor and Human Resources CommitteeReport on the ADA stated that "a person with a disability
applying for or currently holding a job subject to [DOTstandards for drivers] must be able to satisfy these physical
qualification standards in order to be considered a qualifiedindividual with a disability under title I of this legislation."

and yellow." 57 Fed. Reg. 6793-6794 (1992) (internal quotation marks
omitted). In 1952, the visual acuity standard was strengthened to require
at least 20/40 (Snellen) in each eye. Id., at 6794.

Opinion of the Court
S. Rep. No. 101-116, pp. 27-28 (1998). The two primaryHouse Committees shared this understanding, see H. R. Rep.

No. 101-485, pt. 2, p. 57 (1990) (House Education and LaborCommittee Report);

id., pt. 3, at 34 (House Judiciary Committee Report). Accordingly, two of these Committees
asked "the Secretary of Transportation [to] undertake athorough review" of current knowledge about the capabilities of individuals with disabilities and available techno-logical aids and devices, and make "any necessary changes"
within two years of the enactment of the ADA. S. Rep.No. 101-116, at 27-28; see H. R. Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 2, at
57; see also id., pt. 3, at 34 (expressing the expectation that
the Secretary of Transportation would "review these requirements to determine whether they are valid under this
Act"). Finally, when the FHWA instituted the waiver program it addressed the statutory mandate by stating in its
notice of final disposition that the scheme would be "consistent with the safe operation of commercial motor vehicles,"
just as 49 U. S. C. App. $ 2505(f) (1988 ed.) required, 57 Fed.
Reg. 31460 (1992).

And yet, despite this background, the regulations establishing the waiver program did not modify the general visual
acuity standards. It is not that the waiver regulations
failed to do so in a merely formal sense, as by turning waiver
decisions on driving records, not sight requirements. The
FHWA in fact made it clear that it had no evidentiary basis
for concluding that the pre-existing standards could be lowered consistently with public safety. When, in 1992, the
FHWA published an "[a]dvance notice of proposed rulemaking" requesting comments "on the need, if any, to amend
its driver qualification requirements relating to the vision
standard," id., at 6793, it candidly proposed its waiver
scheme as simply a means of obtaining information bearing
on the justifiability of revising the binding standards already
in place, see id., at 10295. The agency explained that the
"object of the waiver program is to provide objective data

527US2 Unit: $U87 [05-09-01 13:04:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN

575Cite as: 527 U. S. 555 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
to be considered in relation to a rulemaking exploring the
feasibility of relaxing the current absolute vision standards in 49 CFR part 391 in favor of a more individualized
standard." Ibid. As proposed, therefore, there was not
only no change in the unconditional acuity standards, but no
indication even that the FHWA then had a basis in fact to
believe anything more lenient would be consistent with public safety as a general matter. After a bumpy stretch of
administrative procedure, see Advocates for Highway and
Auto Safety v. FHWA, 28 F. 3d 1288, 1290 (CADC 1994), the
FHWA's final disposition explained again that the waivers
were proposed as a way to gather facts going to the wisdom
of changing the existing law. The waiver program "will
enable the FHWA to conduct a study comparing a group
of experienced, visually deficient drivers with a control
group of experienced drivers who meet the current Federal
vision requirements. This study will provide the empirical
data necessary to evaluate the relationships between specific
visual deficiencies and the operation of [commercial motor
vehicles]. The data will permit the FHWA to properly evaluate its current vision requirement in the context of actual
driver performance, and, if necessary, establish a new vision
requirement which is safe, fair, and rationally related to the
latest medical knowledge and highway technology." 57 Fed.
Reg. 31458 (1992). And if all this were not enough to show
that the FHWA was planning to give waivers solely to collect
information, it acknowledged that a study it had commissioned had done no more than " `illuminat[e] the lack of empirical data to establish a link between vision disorders
and commercial motor vehicle safety,' " and " `failed to provide a sufficient foundation on which to propose a satisfactory vision standard for drivers of [commercial motor
vehicles] in interstate commerce,' " Advocates for Highway
and Auto Safety, supra, at 1293 (quoting 57 Fed. Reg.
31458 (1992)).

Opinion of the Court
In sum, the regulatory record made it plain that thewaiver regulation did not rest on any final, factual conclusion that the waiver scheme would be conducive to publicsafety in the manner of the general acuity standards and did
not purport to modify the substantive content of the gen-eral acuity regulation in any way. The waiver program was
simply an experiment with safety, however well intended,resting on a hypothesis whose confirmation or refutation in
practice would provide a factual basis for reconsidering theexisting standards.

21

21 Though irrelevant to the disposition of this case, it is hardly surprising
that two years after the events here the waiver regulations were struck
down for failure of the FHWA to support its formulaic finding of consistency with public safety. See Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety v.
FHWA, 28 F. 3d 1288, 1289 (CADC 1994). On remand, the agency "revalidated" the waivers it had already issued, based in part on evidence
relating to the safety of drivers in the program that had not been included in the record before the District of Columbia Circuit. See 59 Fed.
Reg. 50887, 50889-50890 (1994); id., at 59386, 59389. In the meantime the
FHWA has apparently continued to want things both ways. It has said
publicly, based on a review of the data it collected from the waiver program itself, that the drivers who obtained such waivers have performed
better as a class than those who satisfied the regulation. See id., at 50887,
50890. It has also recently noted that its medical panel has recommended
"leaving the visual acuity standard unchanged," see 64 Fed. Reg. 16518
(1999) (citing F. Berson, M. Kuperwaser, L. Aiello, and J. Rosenberg, Visual Requirements and Commercial Drivers, Oct. 16, 1998), a recommendation which the FHWA has concluded supports its "view that the present
standard is reasonable and necessary as a general standard to ensure highway safety." 64 Fed. Reg. 16518 (1999).

The waiver program in which Kirkingburg participated expired on
March 31, 1996, at which point the FHWA allowed all still-active participants to continue to operate in interstate commerce, provided they continued to meet certain medical and other requirements. See 61 Fed. Reg.
13338, 13345 (1996); 49 CFR $ 391.64 (1998). The FHWA justified this
decision based on the safety record of participants in the original waiver
program. See 61 Fed. Reg. 13338, 13345 (1996). In the wake of a 1996
decision from the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit
requiring the FHWA to justify the exclusion of further participants in the
waiver program, see Rauenhorst v. United States Dept. of Transporta527US2 Unit: $U87 [05-09-01 13:04:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN

577Cite as: 527 U. S. 555 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
Nothing in the waiver regulation, of course, required an
employer of commercial drivers to accept the hypothesis
and participate in the Government's experiment. The only
question, then, is whether the ADA should be read to require such an employer to defend a decision to decline the
experiment. Is it reasonable, that is, to read the ADA as
requiring an employer like Albertson's to shoulder the general statutory burden to justify a job qualification that would
tend to exclude the disabled, whenever the employer chooses
to abide by the otherwise clearly applicable, unamended
substantive regulatory standard despite the Government's
willingness to waive it experimentally and without any finding of its being inappropriate? If the answer were yes, an
employer would in fact have an obligation of which we can
think of no comparable example in our law. The employer
would be required in effect to justify de novo an existing and
otherwise applicable safety regulation issued by the Government itself. The employer would be required on a caseby-case basis to reinvent the Government's own wheel when
the Government had merely begun an experiment to provide data to consider changing the underlying specifications.
And what is even more, the employer would be required to
do so when the Government had made an affirmative record
indicating that contemporary empirical evidence was hard
to come by. It is simply not credible that Congress enacted
the ADA (before there was any waiver program) with the
understanding that employers choosing to respect the Government's sole substantive visual acuity regulation in the

tion, FHWA, 95 F. 3d 715, 723 (1996), the agency began taking new applicants for waivers, see, e. g., 63 Fed. Reg. 66226 (1998). The agency has
now initiated a program under the authority granted in the Transportation
Equity Act for the 21st Century, Pub. L. 105-178, 112 Stat. 107, to grant
exemptions on a more regular basis, see 63 Fed. Reg. 67600 (1998) (interim
final rule implementing the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century). The effect of the current exemption program has not been challenged in this case, and we have no occasion to consider it.

face of an experimental waiver might be burdened with anobligation to defend the regulation's application according

to its own terms.The judgment of the Ninth Circuit is accordingly reversed.

It is so ordered.
Justice Thomas, concurring.
As the Government reads the Americans with Disabilities
Act of 1990 (ADA or Act), 104 Stat. 327, as amended, 42U. S. C. $ 12101

et seq. (1994 ed. and Supp. III), it requires
that petitioner justify the Department of Transportation's(DOT) visual acuity standards as job related, consistent with

business necessity, and required to prevent employees fromimposing a direct threat to the health and safety of others in
the workplace. The Court assumes, for purposes of this
case, that the Government's reading is, for the most part,correct.

Ante, at 569, and n. 15. I agree with the Court's
decision that, even when the case is analyzed through the
Government's proposed lens, petitioner was entitled to summary judgment in this case. As the Court explains, ante, at
577 and this page, it would be unprecedented and nonsensical
to interpret $ 12113 to require petitioner to defend the application of the Government's regulation to respondent when
petitioner has an unconditional obligation to enforce the federal law.

As the Court points out, though, ante, at 567, DOT's visual
acuity standards might also be relevant to the question
whether respondent was a "qualified individual with a disability" under 42 U. S. C. $ 12112(a). That section provides
that no covered entity "shall discriminate against a qualified
individual with a disability because of the disability of such
individual." Presumably, then, a plaintiff claiming a cause
of action under the ADA bears the burden of proving, inter
alia, that he is a qualified individual. The phrase "qualified
individual with a disability" is defined to mean:

527US2 Unit: $U87 [05-09-01 13:04:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Thomas, J., concurring
"an individual with a disability who, with or without
reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential
functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires. For the purposes of this subchapter, consideration shall be given to the employer's
judgment as to what functions of a job are essential,
and if an employer has prepared a written description
before advertising or interviewing applicants for the
job this description shall be considered evidence of
the essential functions of the job." $ 12111(8) (emphasis added).

In this case, respondent sought a job driving trucks in interstate commerce. The quintessential function of that job,
it seems to me, is to be able to drive a commercial truck
in interstate commerce, and it was respondent's burden to
prove that he could do so.

As the Court explains, ante, at 570, DOT's Motor Carrier
Safety Regulations have the force of law and bind petitioner--it may not, by law, "permit a person to drive a commercial motor vehicle unless that person is qualified to
drive." 49 CFR $ 391.11 (1999). But by the same token,
DOT's regulations bind respondent, who "shall not drive
a commercial motor vehicle unless he/she is qualified to
drive a commercial motor vehicle." Ibid.; see also $ 391.41
("A person shall not drive a commercial motor vehicle unless he/she is physically qualified to do so"). Given that
DOT's regulation equally binds petitioner and respondent,
and that it is conceded in this case that respondent could
not meet the federal requirements, respondent surely was
not "qualified" to perform the essential functions of petitioner's truckdriver job without a reasonable accommodation. The waiver program might be thought of as a way to
reasonably accommodate respondent, but for the fact, as the
Court explains, ante, at 571-576, that the program did nothing to modify the regulation's unconditional requirements.

For that reason, requiring petitioner to make such an accom-modation most certainly would have been unreasonable.

The result of this case is the same under either view ofthe statute. If forced to choose between these alternatives,
however, I would prefer to hold that respondent, as a matterof law, was not qualified to perform the job he sought within
the meaning of the ADA. I nevertheless join the Court'sopinion. The Ninth Circuit below viewed respondent's ADA
claim on the Government's terms and petitioner's argumenthere appears to be tailored around the Government's view.
In these circumstances, I agree with the Court's approach.I join the Court's opinion, however, only on the understanding that it leaves open the argument that federal laws suchas DOT's visual acuity standards might be critical in determining whether a plaintiff is a "qualified individual with adisability."

friend, et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eleventh circuit

No. 98-536. Argued April 21, 1999--Decided June 22, 1999
In the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), Congress described

the isolation and segregation of individuals with disabilities as a serious and pervasive form of discrimination. 42 U. S. C. $$ 12101(a)(2), (5).
Title II of the ADA, which proscribes discrimination in the provision
of public services, specifies, inter alia, that no qualified individual
with a disability shall, "by reason of such disability," be excluded from
participation in, or be denied the benefits of, a public entity's services, programs, or activities. $ 12132. Congress instructed the Attorney General to issue regulations implementing Title II's discrimination proscription. See $ 12134(a). One such regulation, known as the
"integration regulation," requires a "public entity [to] administer . . .
programs . . . in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs
of qualified individuals with disabilities." 28 CFR $ 35.130(d). A further prescription, here called the "reasonable-modifications regulation,"
requires public entities to "make reasonable modifications" to avoid
"discrimination on the basis of disability," but does not require measures
that would "fundamentally alter" the nature of the entity's programs.

$ 35.130(b)(7).

Respondents L. C. and E. W. are mentally retarded women; L. C.
has also been diagnosed with schizophrenia, and E. W., with a personality disorder. Both women were voluntarily admitted to Georgia
Regional Hospital at Atlanta (GRH), where they were confined for
treatment in a psychiatric unit. Although their treatment professionals
eventually concluded that each of the women could be cared for appropriately in a community-based program, the women remained institutionalized at GRH. Seeking placement in community care, L. C. filed
this suit against petitioner state officials (collectively, the State) under
42 U. S. C. $ 1983 and Title II. She alleged that the State violated
Title II in failing to place her in a community-based program once
her treating professionals determined that such placement was appropriate. E. W. intervened, stating an identical claim. The District
Court granted partial summary judgment for the women, ordering their

placement in an appropriate community-based treatment program.
The court rejected the State's argument that inadequate funding, not
discrimination against L. C. and E. W. "by reason of [their] disabilit[ies],"
accounted for their retention at GRH. Under Title II, the court concluded, unnecessary institutional segregation constitutes discrimination
per se, which cannot be justified by a lack of funding. The court also
rejected the State's defense that requiring immediate transfers in such
cases would "fundamentally alter" the State's programs. The Eleventh
Circuit affirmed the District Court's judgment, but remanded for reassessment of the State's cost-based defense. The District Court had left
virtually no room for such a defense. The appeals court read the statute and regulations to allow the defense, but only in tightly limited
circumstances. Accordingly, the Eleventh Circuit instructed the District Court to consider, as a key factor, whether the additional cost for
treatment of L. C. and E. W. in community-based care would be unreasonable given the demands of the State's mental health budget.

Held: The judgment is affirmed in part and vacated in part, and the case

is remanded.

138 F. 3d 893, affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded.

Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court with respect
to Parts I, II, and III-A, concluding that, under Title II of the ADA,
States are required to place persons with mental disabilities in community settings rather than in institutions when the State's treatment professionals have determined that community placement is appropriate,
the transfer from institutional care to a less restrictive setting is not
opposed by the affected individual, and the placement can be reasonably
accommodated, taking into account the resources available to the State
and the needs of others with mental disabilities. Pp. 596-603.

(a) The integration and reasonable-modifications regulations issued
by the Attorney General rest on two key determinations: (1) Unjustified
placement or retention of persons in institutions severely limits their
exposure to the outside community, and therefore constitutes a form of
discrimination based on disability prohibited by Title II, and (2) qualifying their obligation to avoid unjustified isolation of individuals with
disabilities, States can resist modifications that would fundamentally
alter the nature of their services and programs. The Eleventh Circuit
essentially upheld the Attorney General's construction of the ADA.
This Court affirms the Court of Appeals decision in substantial part.
Pp. 596-597.

(b) Undue institutionalization qualifies as discrimination "by reason
of . . . disability." The Department of Justice has consistently advocated that it does. Because the Department is the agency directed

by Congress to issue Title II regulations, its views warrant respect.
This Court need not inquire whether the degree of deference described
in Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,
467 U. S. 837, 844, is in order; the well-reasoned views of the agencies
implementing a statute constitute a body of experience and informed
judgment to which courts and litigants may properly resort for guidance. E. g., Bragdon v. Abbott, 524 U. S. 624, 642. According to the
State, L. C. and E. W. encountered no discrimination "by reason of"
their disabilities because they were not denied community placement
on account of those disabilities, nor were they subjected to "discrimination," for they identified no comparison class of similarly situated individuals given preferential treatment. In rejecting these positions,
the Court recognizes that Congress had a more comprehensive view of
the concept of discrimination advanced in the ADA. The ADA stepped
up earlier efforts in the Developmentally Disabled Assistance and Bill
of Rights Act and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to secure opportunities for people with developmental disabilities to enjoy the benefits of
community living. The ADA both requires all public entities to refrain
from discrimination, see $ 12132, and specifically identifies unjustified
"segregation" of persons with disabilities as a "for[m] of discrimination,"
see $$ 12101(a)(2), 12101(a)(5). The identification of unjustified segregation as discrimination reflects two evident judgments: Institutional
placement of persons who can handle and benefit from community settings perpetuates unwarranted assumptions that persons so isolated are
incapable or unworthy of participating in community life, cf., e. g., Allen
v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737, 755; and institutional confinement severely
diminishes individuals' everyday life activities. Dissimilar treatment
correspondingly exists in this key respect: In order to receive needed
medical services, persons with mental disabilities must, because of those
disabilities, relinquish participation in community life they could enjoy
given reasonable accommodations, while persons without mental disabilities can receive the medical services they need without similar
sacrifice. The State correctly uses the past tense to frame its argument that, despite Congress' ADA findings, the Medicaid statute "reflected" a congressional policy preference for institutional treatment
over treatment in the community. Since 1981, Medicaid has in fact provided funding for state-run home and community-based care through a
waiver program. This Court emphasizes that nothing in the ADA or
its implementing regulations condones termination of institutional settings for persons unable to handle or benefit from community settings.
Nor is there any federal requirement that community-based treatment
be imposed on patients who do not desire it. In this case, however,
it is not genuinely disputed that L. C. and E. W. are individuals "quali527US2 Unit: $U88 [05-03-01 13:21:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN

fied" for noninstitutional care: The State's own professionals determined
that community-based treatment would be appropriate for L. C. and
E. W., and neither woman opposed such treatment. Pp. 597-603.

Justice Ginsburg, joined by Justice O'Connor, Justice Souter,
and Justice Breyer, concluded in Part III-B that the State's responsibility, once it provides community-based treatment to qualified persons with disabilities, is not boundless. The reasonable-modifications
regulation speaks of "reasonable modifications" to avoid discrimination,
and allows States to resist modifications that entail a "fundamenta[l]
alter[ation]" of the States' services and programs. If, as the Eleventh
Circuit indicated, the expense entailed in placing one or two people in a
community-based treatment program is properly measured for reasonableness against the State's entire mental health budget, it is unlikely
that a State, relying on the fundamental-alteration defense, could ever
prevail. Sensibly construed, the fundamental-alteration component of
the reasonable-modifications regulation would allow the State to show
that, in the allocation of available resources, immediate relief for the
plaintiffs would be inequitable, given the responsibility the State has
undertaken for the care and treatment of a large and diverse population of persons with mental disabilities. The ADA is not reasonably
read to impel States to phase out institutions, placing patients in need
of close care at risk. Nor is it the ADA's mission to drive States to
move institutionalized patients into an inappropriate setting, such as
a homeless shelter, a placement the State proposed, then retracted,
for E. W. Some individuals, like L. C. and E. W. in prior years, may
need institutional care from time to time to stabilize acute psychiatric
symptoms. For others, no placement outside the institution may ever
be appropriate. To maintain a range of facilities and to administer
services with an even hand, the State must have more leeway than the
courts below understood the fundamental-alteration defense to allow.
If, for example, the State were to demonstrate that it had a comprehensive, effectively working plan for placing qualified persons with
mental disabilities in less restrictive settings, and a waiting list that
moved at a reasonable pace not controlled by the State's endeavors
to keep its institutions fully populated, the reasonable-modifications
standard would be met. In such circumstances, a court would have
no warrant effectively to order displacement of persons at the top of
the community-based treatment waiting list by individuals lower down
who commenced civil actions. The case is remanded for further consideration of the appropriate relief, given the range of the State's facilities for the care of persons with diverse mental disabilities, and its
obligation to administer services with an even hand. Pp. 603-606.

Justice Stevens would affirm the judgment of the Court of
Appeals, but because there are not five votes for that disposition,
joined the Court's judgment and Parts I, II, and III-A of its opinion.
Pp. 607-608.

Justice Kennedy concluded that the case must be remanded for a
determination of the questions the Court poses and for a determination
whether respondents can show a violation of 42 U. S. C. $ 12132's ban
on discrimination based on the summary judgment materials on file or
any further pleadings and materials properly allowed. On the ordinary
interpretation and meaning of the term, one who alleges discrimination
must show that she received differential treatment vis-a`-vis members
of a different group on the basis of a statutorily described characteristic.
Thus, respondents could demonstrate discrimination by showing that
Georgia (i) provides treatment to individuals suffering from medical
problems of comparable seriousness, (ii) as a general matter, does so
in the most integrated setting appropriate for the treatment of those
problems (taking medical and other practical considerations into account), but (iii) without adequate justification, fails to do so for a group
of mentally disabled persons (treating them instead in separate, locked
institutional facilities). This inquiry would not be simple. Comparisons of different medical conditions and the corresponding treatment
regimens might be difficult, as would be assessments of the degree of
integration of various settings in which medical treatment is offered.
Thus far, respondents have identified no class of similarly situated individuals, let alone shown them to have been given preferential treatment.
Without additional information, the Court cannot address the issue in
the way the statute demands. As a consequence, the partial summary
judgment granted respondents ought not to be sustained. In addition,
it was error in the earlier proceedings to restrict the relevance and
force of the State's evidence regarding the comparative costs of treatment. The State is entitled to wide discretion in adopting its own systems of cost analysis, and, if it chooses, to allocate health care resources
based on fixed and overhead costs for whole institutions and programs.
The lower courts should determine in the first instance whether a statutory violation is sufficiently alleged and supported in respondents' summary judgment materials and, if not, whether they should be given
leave to replead and to introduce evidence and argument along the lines
suggested. Pp. 611-615.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Ginsburg announced the judgment of the Court
and delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to
Parts I, II, and III-A, and an opinion with respect to Part
III-B, in which Justice O'Connor, Justice Souter, and
Justice Breyer join.

This case concerns the proper construction of the antidiscrimination provision contained in the public services
portion (Title II) of the Americans with Disabilities Act
of 1990 (ADA), 104 Stat. 337, 42 U. S. C. $ 12132. Specifically, we confront the question whether the proscription of
discrimination may require placement of persons with mental disabilities in community settings rather than in institutions. The answer, we hold, is a qualified yes. Such action
is in order when the State's treatment professionals have
determined that community placement is appropriate, the
transfer from institutional care to a less restrictive setting
is not opposed by the affected individual, and the placement
can be reasonably accommodated, taking into account the resources available to the State and the needs of others with
mental disabilities. In so ruling, we affirm the decision of
the Eleventh Circuit in substantial part. We remand the
case, however, for further consideration of the appropriate
relief, given the range of facilities the State maintains for
the care and treatment of persons with diverse mental disabilities, and its obligation to administer services with an
even hand.

Opinion of the Court

I
This case, as it comes to us, presents no constitutionalquestion. The complaints filed by plaintiffs-respondents

L. C. and E. W. did include such an issue; L. C. and E. W.alleged that defendants-petitioners, Georgia health care
officials, failed to afford them minimally adequate care andfreedom from undue restraint, in violation of their rights
under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amend-ment. See Complaint |||| 87-91; Intervenor's Complaint
|||| 30-34. But neither the District Court nor the Court ofAppeals reached those Fourteenth Amendment claims. See
Civ. No. 1:95-cv-1210-MHS (ND Ga., Mar. 26, 1997), pp. 5-6,11-13, App. to Pet. for Cert. 34a-35a, 40a-41a; 138 F. 3d 893,
895, and n. 3 (CA11 1998). Instead, the courts below re-solved the case solely on statutory grounds. Our review is
similarly confined. Cf. Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center,
Inc., 473 U. S. 432, 450 (1985) (Texas city's requirement ofspecial use permit for operation of group home for mentally

retarded, when other care and multiple-dwelling facilitieswere freely permitted, lacked rational basis and therefore
violated Equal Protection Clause of Fourteenth Amend-ment). Mindful that it is a statute we are construing, we
set out first the legislative and regulatory prescriptions onwhich the case turns.

In the opening provisions of the ADA, Congress statedfindings applicable to the statute in all its parts. Most relevant to this case, Congress determined that

"(2) historically, society has tended to isolate and seg-regate individuals with disabilities, and, despite some

improvements, such forms of discrimination against in-dividuals with disabilities continue to be a serious and
pervasive social problem;"(3) discrimination against individuals with disabilities persists in such critical areas as . . . institutionaliza-tion . . . ;

"(5) individuals with disabilities continually encountervarious forms of discrimination, including outright intentional exclusion, . . . failure to make modificationsto existing facilities and practices, . . . [and] segregation . . . ." 42 U. S. C. $$ 12101(a)(2), (3), (5).1
Congress then set forth prohibitions against discriminationin employment (Title I, $$ 12111-12117), public services furnished by governmental entities (Title II, $$ 12131-12165),and public accommodations provided by private entities
(Title III, $$ 12181-12189). The statute as a whole is in-tended "to provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individualswith disabilities." $ 12101(b)(1).

This case concerns Title II, the public services portionof the ADA.

reads:

"Subject to the provisions of this subchapter, no quali-fied individual with a disability shall, by reason of such

1 The ADA, enacted in 1990, is the Federal Government's most recent
and extensive endeavor to address discrimination against persons with
disabilities. Earlier legislative efforts included the Rehabilitation Act
of 1973, 87 Stat. 355, 29 U. S. C. $ 701 et seq. (1976 ed.), and the Developmentally Disabled Assistance and Bill of Rights Act, 89 Stat. 486, 42
U. S. C. $ 6001 et seq. (1976 ed.), enacted in 1975. In the ADA, Congress
for the first time referred expressly to "segregation" of persons with disabilities as a "for[m] of discrimination," and to discrimination that persists
in the area of "institutionalization." $$ 12101(a)(2), (3), (5).

2 The ADA defines "disability," "with respect to an individual," as

"(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or
more of the major life activities of such individual;

"(B) a record of such an impairment; or
"(C) being regarded as having such an impairment." $ 12102(2).

There is no dispute that L. C. and E. W. are disabled within the meaning
of the ADA.

3 In addition to the provisions set out in Part A governing public services generally, see $$ 12131-12134, Title II contains in Part B a host of
provisions governing public transportation services, see $$ 12141-12165.

public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by anysuch entity." $ 201, as set forth in 42 U. S. C. $ 12132.

Title II's definition section states that "public entity" in-cludes "any State or local government," and "any department, agency, [or] special purpose district." $$ 12131(1)(A),(B). The same section defines "qualified individual with a
disability" as

"an individual with a disability who, with or withoutreasonable modifications to rules, policies, or practices,

the removal of architectural, communication, or trans-portation barriers, or the provision of auxiliary aids and
services, meets the essential eligibility requirements forthe receipt of services or the participation in programs
or activities provided by a public entity." $ 12131(2).
On redress for violations of $ 12132's discrimination pro-hibition, Congress referred to remedies available under $ 505

of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 92 Stat. 2982, 29 U. S. C.$ 794a. See $ 203, as set forth in 42 U. S. C. $ 12133 ("The
remedies, procedures, and rights set forth in [$ 505 of theRehabilitation Act] shall be the remedies, procedures, and
rights this subchapter provides to any person alleging dis-crimination on the basis of disability in violation of section
12132 of this title.").4

4 Section 505 of the Rehabilitation Act incorporates the remedies,
rights, and procedures set forth in Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of
1964 for violations of $ 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. See 29 U. S. C.

$ 794a(a)(2). Title VI, in turn, directs each federal department authorized
to extend financial assistance to any department or agency of a State to
issue rules and regulations consistent with achievement of the objectives of the statute authorizing financial assistance. See 78 Stat. 252, 42
U. S. C. $ 2000d-1. Compliance with such requirements may be effected
by the termination or denial of federal funds, or "by any other means
authorized by law." Ibid. Remedies both at law and in equity are available for violations of the statute. See $ 2000d-7(a)(2).

implementing the portion of Title II concerning public transportation.
See 42 U. S. C. $$ 12143(b), 12149, 12164. As stated in the regulations,
a person alleging discrimination on the basis of disability in violation of
Title II may seek to enforce its provisions by commencing a private lawsuit, or by filing a complaint with (a) a federal agency that provides funding to the public entity that is the subject of the complaint, (b) the Department of Justice for referral to an appropriate agency, or (c) one of eight
federal agencies responsible for investigating complaints arising under
Title II: the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Education, the
Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Housing
and Urban Development, the Department of the Interior, the Department
of Justice, the Department of Labor, and the Department of Transportation. See 28 CFR $$ 35.170(c), 35.172(b), 35.190(b) (1998).

The ADA contains several other provisions allocating regulatory and
enforcement responsibility. Congress instructed the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to issue regulations implementing Title
I, see 42 U. S. C. $ 12116; the EEOC, the Attorney General, and persons
alleging discrimination on the basis of disability in violation of Title I may
enforce its provisions, see $ 12117(a). Congress similarly instructed the
Secretary of Transportation and the Attorney General to issue regulations
implementing provisions of Title III, see $$ 12186(a)(1), (b); the Attorney
General and persons alleging discrimination on the basis of disability in
violation of Title III may enforce its provisions, see $$ 12188(a)(1), (b).

technical assistance to affected individuals and institutions with respect
to provisions of the ADA for which the agency has responsibility. See

setting appropriate to the needs of qualified handicappedpersons." 28 CFR $ 41.51(d) (1998).

As Congress instructed, the Attorney General issued TitleII regulations, see 28 CFR pt. 35 (1998), including one modeled on the $ 504 regulation just quoted; called the "integra-tion regulation," it reads:

"A public entity shall administer services, programs,and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate
to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities."28 CFR $ 35.130(d) (1998).

The preamble to the Attorney General's Title II regulationsdefines "the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs
of qualified individuals with disabilities" to mean "a settingthat enables individuals with disabilities to interact with
non-disabled persons to the fullest extent possible." 28
CFR pt. 35, App. A, p. 450 (1998). Another regulation re-quires public entities to "make reasonable modifications" to

avoid "discrimination on the basis of disability," unless thosemodifications would entail a "fundamenta[l] alter[ation]";
called here the "reasonable-modifications regulation," itprovides:

"A public entity shall make reasonable modificationsin policies, practices, or procedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination on the basisof disability, unless the public entity can demonstrate
that making the modifications would fundamentally
alter the nature of the service, program, or activity."28 CFR $ 35.130(b)(7) (1998).

II
With the key legislative provisions in full view, we summa-rize the facts underlying this dispute. Respondents L. C.

and E. W. are mentally retarded women; L. C. has also beendiagnosed with schizophrenia, and E. W. with a personality
disorder. Both women have a history of treatment in in-stitutional settings. In May 1992, L. C. was voluntarily
admitted to Georgia Regional Hospital at Atlanta (GRH),where she was confined for treatment in a psychiatric unit.
By May 1993, her psychiatric condition had stabilized, andL. C.'s treatment team at GRH agreed that her needs could
be met appropriately in one of the community-based pro-grams the State supported. Despite this evaluation, L. C.
remained institutionalized until February 1996, when theState placed her in a community-based treatment program.

E. W. was voluntarily admitted to GRH in February 1995;like L. C., E. W. was confined for treatment in a psychiatric
unit. In March 1995, GRH sought to discharge E. W. to ahomeless shelter, but abandoned that plan after her attorney
filed an administrative complaint. By 1996, E. W.'s treatingpsychiatrist concluded that she could be treated appropriately in a community-based setting. She nonetheless re-mained institutionalized until a few months after the District
Court issued its judgment in this case in 1997.In May 1995, when she was still institutionalized at
GRH, L. C. filed suit in the United States District Courtfor the Northern District of Georgia, challenging her continued confinement in a segregated environment. Her com-plaint invoked 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 and provisions of the ADA,

$$ 12131-12134, and named as defendants, now petitioners,the Commissioner of the Georgia Department of Human
Resources, the Superintendent of GRH, and the ExecutiveDirector of the Fulton County Regional Board (collectively,

Opinion of the Court
the State). L. C. alleged that the State's failure to placeher in a community-based program, once her treating professionals determined that such placement was appropriate,violated, inter alia, Title II of the ADA. L. C.'s pleading
requested, among other things, that the State place her in acommunity care residential program, and that she receive
treatment with the ultimate goal of integrating her intothe mainstream of society. E. W. intervened in the action,
stating an identical claim.6The District Court granted partial summary judgment in
favor of L. C. and E. W. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 31a-42a.The court held that the State's failure to place L. C. and
E. W. in an appropriate community-based treatment programviolated Title II of the ADA. See

id., at 39a, 41a. In soruling, the court rejected the State's argument that inadequate funding, not discrimination against L. C. and E. W. "byreason of " their disabilities, accounted for their retention at
GRH. Under Title II, the court concluded, "unnecessary in-stitutional segregation of the disabled constitutes discrimination per se, which cannot be justified by a lack of funding."
Id., at 37a.In addition to contending that L. C. and E. W. had not

shown discrimination "by reason of [their] disabilit[ies]," theState resisted court intervention on the ground that requiring immediate transfers in cases of this order would "funda-mentally alter" the State's activity. The State reasserted
that it was already using all available funds to provide serv-ices to other persons with disabilities. See

id., at 38a. Re6 L. C. and E. W. are currently receiving treatment in community-based
programs. Nevertheless, the case is not moot. As the District Court
and Court of Appeals explained, in view of the multiple institutional placements L. C. and E. W. have experienced, the controversy they brought to
court is "capable of repetition, yet evading review." No. 1:95-cv-1210-

Opinion of the Court
jecting the State's "fundamental alteration" defense, thecourt observed that existing state programs provided

community-based treatment of the kind for which L. C. andE. W. qualified, and that the State could "provide services to
plaintiffs in the community at considerably less cost than is
required to maintain them in an institution." Id., at 39a.The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed

the judgment of the District Court, but remanded for reas-sessment of the State's cost-based defense. See 138 F. 3d, at
905. As the appeals court read the statute and regulations:When "a disabled individual's treating professionals find that
a community-based placement is appropriate for that individual, the ADA imposes a duty to provide treatment in a community setting--the most integrated setting appropriate to
that patient's needs"; "[w]here there is no such finding [by
the treating professionals], nothing in the ADA requires the
deinstitutionalization of th[e] patient." Id., at 902.

The Court of Appeals recognized that the State's duty to
provide integrated services "is not absolute"; under the Attorney General's Title II regulation, "reasonable modifications" were required of the State, but fundamental alterations were not demanded. Id., at 904. The appeals court
thought it clear, however, that "Congress wanted to permit
a cost defense only in the most limited of circumstances."
Id., at 902. In conclusion, the court stated that a cost justification would fail "[u]nless the State can prove that requiring it to [expend additional funds in order to provide L. C.
and E. W. with integrated services] would be so unreasonable
given the demands of the State's mental health budget that it
would fundamentally alter the service [the State] provides."
Id., at 905. Because it appeared that the District Court had
entirely ruled out a "lack of funding" justification, see App.
to Pet. for Cert. 37a, the appeals court remanded, repeating
that the District Court should consider, among other things,
"whether the additional expenditures necessary to treat
L. C. and E. W. in community-based care would be unreason527US2 Unit: $U88 [05-03-01 13:21:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN

We granted certiorari in view of the importance of thequestion presented to the States and affected individuals.

See 525 U. S. 1054 (1998).8 III

Endeavoring to carry out Congress' instruction to issueregulations implementing Title II, the Attorney General,
in the integration and reasonable-modifications regulations,see supra, at 591-592, made two key determinations. The
first concerned the scope of the ADA's discrimination pro-scription, 42 U. S. C. $ 12132; the second concerned the obligation of the States to counter discrimination. As to thefirst, the Attorney General concluded that unjustified placement or retention of persons in institutions, severely limitingtheir exposure to the outside community, constitutes a form
of discrimination based on disability prohibited by Title II.See 28 CFR $ 35.130(d) (1998) ("A public entity shall administer services . . . in the most integrated setting appropriateto the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities."); Brief
for United States as Amicus Curiae in Helen L. v. DiDario,No. 94-1243 (CA3 1994), pp. 8, 15-16 (unnecessary segregation of persons with disabilities constitutes a form ofdiscrimination prohibited by the ADA and the integration

7 After this Court granted certiorari, the District Court issued a decision on remand rejecting the State's fundamental-alteration defense.
See 1:95-cv-1210-MHS (ND Ga., Jan. 29, 1999), p. 1. The court concluded
that the annual cost to the State of providing community-based treatment
to L. C. and E. W. was not unreasonable in relation to the State's overall
mental health budget. See id., at 5. In reaching that judgment, the District Court first declared "irrelevant" the potential impact of its decision
beyond L. C. and E. W. 1:95-cv-1210-MHS (ND Ga., Oct. 20, 1998), p. 3,
App. 177. The District Court's decision on remand is now pending appeal
before the Eleventh Circuit.

8 Twenty-two States and the Territory of Guam joined a brief urging

that certiorari be granted. Ten of those States joined a brief in support
of petitioners on the merits.

regulation). Regarding the States' obligation to avoid un-justified isolation of individuals with disabilities, the Attorney General provided that States could resist modificationsthat "would fundamentally alter the nature of the service,
program, or activity." 28 CFR $ 35.130(b)(7) (1998).The Court of Appeals essentially upheld the Attorney
General's construction of the ADA. As just recounted, see
supra, at 595-596, the appeals court ruled that the unjusti-fied institutionalization of persons with mental disabilities

violated Title II; the court then remanded with instruc-tions to measure the cost of caring for L. C. and E. W. in a
community-based facility against the State's mental healthbudget.

We affirm the Court of Appeals' decision in substantialpart. Unjustified isolation, we hold, is properly regarded
as discrimination based on disability. But we recognize, aswell, the States' need to maintain a range of facilities for the
care and treatment of persons with diverse mental disabili-ties, and the States' obligation to administer services with
an even hand. Accordingly, we further hold that the Courtof Appeals' remand instruction was unduly restrictive. In
evaluating a State's fundamental-alteration defense, the Dis-trict Court must consider, in view of the resources available
to the State, not only the cost of providing community-basedcare to the litigants, but also the range of services the State
provides others with mental disabilities, and the State's obli-gation to mete out those services equitably.

We examine first whether, as the Eleventh Circuit held,undue institutionalization qualifies as discrimination "by reason of . . . disability." The Department of Justice has con-sistently advocated that it does.

The State argues that L. C. and E. W. encountered no dis-crimination "by reason of " their disabilities because they
were not denied community placement on account of thosedisabilities. See Brief for Petitioners 20. Nor were they
subjected to "discrimination," the State contends, because" `discrimination' necessarily requires uneven treatment of

Opinion of the Court
The ADA stepped up earlier measures to secure oppor-tunities for people with developmental disabilities to enjoy

the benefits of community living. The DevelopmentallyDisabled Assistance and Bill of Rights Act, a 1975 measure, stated in aspirational terms that "[t]he treatment, serv-ices, and habilitation for a person with developmental disabilities . . . should be provided in the setting that is leastrestrictive of the person's personal liberty." 89 Stat. 502,

Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 451U. S. 1, 24 (1981) (concluding that the $ 6010 provisions "were

intended to be hortatory, not mandatory"). In a related legislative endeavor, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Congressused mandatory language to proscribe discrimination against

persons with disabilities. See 87 Stat. 394, as amended, 29U. S. C. $ 794 (1976 ed.) ("No otherwise qualified individual
with a disability in the United States . . . shall, solely byreason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimi-nation under any program or activity receiving Federal fistatutory prohibitions against `discrimination' have not wavered from this
path," post, at 616, and that "a plaintiff cannot prove `discrimination' by
demonstrating that one member of a particular protected group has been
favored over another member of that same group," post, at 618. The dissent is incorrect as a matter of precedent and logic. See O'Connor v.
Consolidated Coin Caterers Corp., 517 U. S. 308, 312 (1996) (The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 "does not ban discrimination
against employees because they are aged 40 or older; it bans discrimination against employees because of their age, but limits the protected class
to those who are 40 or older. The fact that one person in the protected
class has lost out to another person in the protected class is thus irrelevant, so long as he has lost out because of his age."); cf. Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc., 523 U. S. 75, 76 (1998) ("[W]orkplace harassment can violate Title VII's prohibition against `discriminat[ion] . . .

nancial assistance." (Emphasis added.)) Ultimately, in the
ADA, enacted in 1990, Congress not only required all public
entities to refrain from discrimination, see 42 U. S. C. $ 12132;
additionally, in findings applicable to the entire statute, Congress explicitly identified unjustified "segregation" of persons with disabilities as a "for[m] of discrimination." See

$ 12101(a)(2) ("historically, society has tended to isolate and
segregate individuals with disabilities, and, despite some improvements, such forms of discrimination against individuals
with disabilities continue to be a serious and pervasive social
problem"); $ 12101(a)(5) ("individuals with disabilities continually encounter various forms of discrimination, including . . . segregation").11

Recognition that unjustified institutional isolation of persons with disabilities is a form of discrimination reflects two
evident judgments. First, institutional placement of persons who can handle and benefit from community settings
perpetuates unwarranted assumptions that persons so isolated are incapable or unworthy of participating in community life. Cf. Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737, 755 (1984)
("There can be no doubt that [stigmatizing injury often
caused by racial discrimination] is one of the most serious
consequences of discriminatory government action."); Los

against individuals because of their sex, Congress intended

11 Unlike the ADA, $ 504 of the Rehabilitation Act contains no express
recognition that isolation or segregation of persons with disabilities is a
form of discrimination. Section 504's discrimination proscription, a single
sentence attached to vocational rehabilitation legislation, has yielded divergent court interpretations. See Brief for United States as Amicus

family relations, social contacts, work options, economic in-dependence, educational advancement, and cultural enrichment. See Brief for American Psychiatric Association et al.as

Amici Curiae 20-22. Dissimilar treatment correspond-ingly exists in this key respect: In order to receive needed

medical services, persons with mental disabilities must, be-cause of those disabilities, relinquish participation in community life they could enjoy given reasonable accommoda-tions, while persons without mental disabilities can receive
the medical services they need without similar sacrifice.See Brief for United States as

Amicus Curiae 6-7, 17.The State urges that, whatever Congress may have stated

as its findings in the ADA, the Medicaid statute "reflecteda congressional policy preference for treatment in the institution over treatment in the community." Brief for Peti-tioners 31. The State correctly used the past tense. Since
1981, Medicaid has provided funding for state-run homeand community-based care through a waiver program. See
95 Stat. 812-813, as amended, 42 U. S. C. $ 1396n(c); Brieffor United States as

Amicus Curiae 20-21.12 Indeed, theUnited States points out that the Department of Health and

Human Services (HHS) "has a policy of encouraging Statesto take advantage of the waiver program, and often approves
more waiver slots than a State ultimately uses." Id., at25-26 (further observing that, by 1996, "HHS approved up
to 2109 waiver slots for Georgia, but Georgia used only 700").We emphasize that nothing in the ADA or its implementing regulations condones termination of institutional set-tings for persons unable to handle or benefit from community

12 The waiver program provides Medicaid reimbursement to States for
the provision of community-based services to individuals who would otherwise require institutional care, upon a showing that the average annual
cost of such services is not more than the annual cost of institutional services. See $ 1396n(c).

42 U. S. C. $ 12132. "Qualified individuals," the ADA fur-ther explains, are persons with disabilities who, "with or
without reasonable modifications to rules, policies, or prac-tices, . . . mee[t] the essential eligibility requirements for
the receipt of services or the participation in programs oractivities provided by a public entity." $ 12131(2).

Consistent with these provisions, the State generally mayrely on the reasonable assessments of its own professionals
in determining whether an individual "meets the essential
eligibility requirements" for habilitation in a communitybased program. Absent such qualification, it would be in-appropriate to remove a patient from the more restrictive

setting. See 28 CFR $ 35.130(d) (1998) (public entity shalladminister services and programs in "the most integrated

The State's responsibility, once it provides community-based treatment to qualified persons with disabilities, is not

boundless. The reasonable-modifications regulation speaksof "reasonable modifications" to avoid discrimination, and
allows States to resist modifications that entail a "funda-menta[l] alter[ation]" of the States' services and programs.
28 CFR $ 35.130(b)(7) (1998). The Court of Appeals con-strued this regulation to permit a cost-based defense "only
in the most limited of circumstances," 138 F. 3d, at 902, andremanded to the District Court to consider, among other
things, "whether the additional expenditures necessary totreat L. C. and E. W. in community-based care would be
unreasonable given the demands of the State's mental healthbudget," id., at 905.

The Court of Appeals' construction of the reasonable-modifications regulation is unacceptable for it would leave
the State virtually defenseless once it is shown that the plain-tiff is qualified for the service or program she seeks. If the
expense entailed in placing one or two people in a community-based treatment program is properly measured for reasonableness against the State's entire mental health budget, it isunlikely that a State, relying on the fundamental-alteration
defense, could ever prevail. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 27 (State'sattorney argues that Court of Appeals' understanding of the

"standard of care" for whatever medical services they render, or that the
ADA requires States to "provide a certain level of benefits to individuals
with disabilities." Cf. post, at 623, 624 (Thomas, J., dissenting). We do
hold, however, that States must adhere to the ADA's nondiscrimination
requirement with regard to the services they in fact provide.

fundamental-alteration defense, as expressed in its order tothe District Court, "will always preclude the State from a

meaningful defense"); cf. Brief for Petitioners 37-38 (Courtof Appeals' remand order "mistakenly asks the district court
to examine [the fundamental-alteration] defense based onthe cost of providing community care to just two individuals,
not all Georgia citizens who desire community care"); 1:95-cv-1210-MHS (ND Ga., Oct. 20, 1998), p. 3, App. 177 (District Court, on remand, declares the impact of its decisionbeyond L. C. and E. W. "irrelevant"). Sensibly construed,
the fundamental-alteration component of the reasonable-modifications regulation would allow the State to show
that, in the allocation of available resources, immediate re-lief for the plaintiffs would be inequitable, given the responsibility the State has undertaken for the care and treatmentof a large and diverse population of persons with mental
disabilities.When it granted summary judgment for plaintiffs in this
case, the District Court compared the cost of caring for theplaintiffs in a community-based setting with the cost of
caring for them in an institution. That simple comparisonshowed that community placements cost less than institutional confinements. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 39a. As theUnited States recognizes, however, a comparison so simple
overlooks costs the State cannot avoid; most notably, a"State . . . may experience increased overall expenses by
funding community placements without being able to takeadvantage of the savings associated with the closure of institutions." Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 21.15As already observed, see supra, at 601-602, the ADA is
not reasonably read to impel States to phase out institutions,placing patients in need of close care at risk. Cf.

post, at

15 Even if States eventually were able to close some institutions in response to an increase in the number of community placements, the States
would still incur the cost of running partially full institutions in the interim. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 21.

610 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment). Nor is it theADA's mission to drive States to move institutionalized

patients into an inappropriate setting, such as a homelessshelter, a placement the State proposed, then retracted, for
E. W. See supra, at 593. Some individuals, like L. C. and
E. W. in prior years, may need institutional care from timeto time "to stabilize acute psychiatric symptoms." App. 98

(affidavit of Dr. Richard L. Elliott); see 138 F. 3d, at 903("[T]here may be times [when] a patient can be treated in

longer need to retain hospital accommodations for the person
so placed). For other individuals, no placement outside the
institution may ever be appropriate. See Brief for American Psychiatric Association et al. as Amici Curiae 22-23
("Some individuals, whether mentally retarded or mentally
ill, are not prepared at particular times--perhaps in the
short run, perhaps in the long run--for the risks and exposure of the less protective environment of community settings"; for these persons, "institutional settings are needed
and must remain available."); Brief for Voice of the Retarded

To maintain a range of facilities and to administer services
with an even hand, the State must have more leeway than
the courts below understood the fundamental-alteration defense to allow. If, for example, the State were to demonstrate that it had a comprehensive, effectively working plan

for placing qualified persons with mental disabilities in lessrestrictive settings, and a waiting list that moved at a reasonable pace not controlled by the State's endeavors to keepits institutions fully populated, the reasonable-modifications
standard would be met. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 5 (State's at-torney urges that, "by asking [a] person to wait a short time
until a community bed is available, Georgia does not exclude[that] person by reason of disability, neither does Georgia
discriminate against her by reason of disability"); see also

circumstances, a court would have no warrant effectively toorder displacement of persons at the top of the communitybased treatment waiting list by individuals lower down whocommenced civil actions.

16 We reject the Court of Appeals' construction of the reasonablemodifications regulation for another reason. The Attorney General's Title
II regulations, Congress ordered, "shall be consistent with" the regulations in part 41 of Title 28 of the Code of Federal Regulations implementing $ 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. 42 U. S. C. $ 12134(b). The $ 504
regulation upon which the reasonable-modifications regulation is based
provides now, as it did at the time the ADA was enacted:

"A recipient shall make reasonable accommodation to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified handicapped applicant
or employee unless the recipient can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of its program."
28 CFR $ 41.53 (1990 and 1998 eds.).

While the part 41 regulations do not define "undue hardship," other

$ 504 regulations make clear that the "undue hardship" inquiry requires
not simply an assessment of the cost of the accommodation in relation to
the recipient's overall budget, but a "case-by-case analysis weighing factors that include: (1) [t]he overall size of the recipient's program with
respect to number of employees, number and type of facilities, and size
of budget; (2) [t]he type of the recipient's operation, including the composition and structure of the recipient's workforce; and (3) [t]he nature
and cost of the accommodation needed." 28 CFR $ 42.511(c) (1998); see
45 CFR $ 84.12(c) (1998) (same).

* * *For the reasons stated, we conclude that, under Title II

of the ADA, States are required to provide community-based treatment for persons with mental disabilities when
the State's treatment professionals determine that suchplacement is appropriate, the affected persons do not oppose such treatment, and the placement can be reasonablyaccommodated, taking into account the resources available
to the State and the needs of others with mental disabilities.The judgment of the Eleventh Circuit is therefore affirmed

Unjustified disparate treatment, in this case, "unjustifiedinstitutional isolation," constitutes discrimination under the
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. See ante, at 600.If a plaintiff requests relief that requires modification of
a State's services or programs, the State may assert, as anaffirmative defense, that the requested modification would
cause a fundamental alteration of a State's services andprograms. In this case, the Court of Appeals appropriately remanded for consideration of the State's affirmativedefense. On remand, the District Court rejected the State's
"fundamental-alteration defense." See ante, at 596, n. 7.If the District Court was wrong in concluding that costs
unrelated to the treatment of L. C. and E. W. do not support such a defense in this case, that arguable error shouldbe corrected either by the Court of Appeals or by this Court

should simply affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.

Despite remarkable advances and achievements by medi-cal science, and agreement among many professionals that

even severe mental illness is often treatable, the extent ofpublic resources to devote to this cause remains controversial. Knowledgeable professionals tell us that our so-ciety, and the governments which reflect its attitudes and
preferences, have yet to grasp the potential for treatingmental disorders, especially severe mental illness. As a result, necessary resources for the endeavor often are notforthcoming. During the course of a year, about 5.6 million
Americans will suffer from severe mental illness. E. Tor-rey, Out of the Shadows 4 (1997). Some 2.2 million of these
persons receive no treatment. Id., at 6. Millions of otherAmericans suffer from mental disabilities of less serious
degree, such as mild depression. These facts are part of thebackground against which this case arises. In addition, of
course, persons with mental disabilities have been subject tohistoric mistreatment, indifference, and hostility. See,

e. g.,Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc., 473 U. S. 432, 461-

464 (1985) (Marshall, J., concurring in judgment in part anddissenting in part) (discussing treatment of the mentally
retarded).Despite these obstacles, the States have acknowledged
that the care of the mentally disabled is their special obli-gation. They operate and support facilities and programs,
sometimes elaborate ones, to provide care. It is a continu527US2 Unit: $U88 [05-03-01 13:21:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ing challenge, though, to provide the care in an effectiveand humane way, particularly because societal attitudes and

the responses of public authorities have changed from timeto time.

Beginning in the 1950's, many victims of severe mental
illness were moved out of state-run hospitals, often withbenign objectives. According to one estimate, when adjusted for population growth, "the actual decrease in thenumbers of people with severe mental illnesses in public
psychiatric hospitals between 1955 and 1994 was 92 per-cent." Brief for American Psychiatric Association et al.
as Amici Curiae 21, n. 5 (citing Torrey, supra, at 8-9). Thiswas not without benefit or justification. The so-called "deinstitutionalization" has permitted a substantial number of
mentally disabled persons to receive needed treatment withgreater freedom and dignity. It may be, moreover, that

those who remain institutionalized are indeed the most se-vere cases. With reference to this case, as the Court points
out, ante, at 593, 603, it is undisputed that the State's owntreating professionals determined that community-based
care was medically appropriate for respondents. Neverthe-less, the depopulation of state mental hospitals has its dark
side. According to one expert:

"For a substantial minority . . . deinstitutionalization has been a psychiatric Titanic. Their lives arevirtually devoid of `dignity' or `integrity of body, mind,

and spirit.' `Self-determination' often means merely
that the person has a choice of soup kitchens. The`least restrictive setting' frequently turns out to be a

cardboard box, a jail cell, or a terror-filled existence
plagued by both real and imaginary enemies." Torrey,
supra, at 11.

It must be remembered that for the person with severe mental illness who has no treatment the most dreaded of confinements can be the imprisonment inflicted by his own mind,

which shuts reality out and subjects him to the torment of
voices and images beyond our own powers to describe.

It would be unreasonable, it would be a tragic event, then,
were the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) to
be interpreted so that States had some incentive, for fear
of litigation, to drive those in need of medical care and treatment out of appropriate care and into settings with too little
assistance and supervision. The opinion of a responsible
treating physician in determining the appropriate conditions for treatment ought to be given the greatest of deference. It is a common phenomenon that a patient functions well with medication, yet, because of the mental illness
itself, lacks the discipline or capacity to follow the regime
the medication requires. This is illustrative of the factors
a responsible physician will consider in recommending the
appropriate setting or facility for treatment. Justice Ginsburg's opinion takes account of this background. It is careful, and quite correct, to say that it is not "the ADA's mission to drive States to move institutionalized patients into
an inappropriate setting, such as a homeless shelter . . . ."
Ante, at 605.

In light of these concerns, if the principle of liability
announced by the Court is not applied with caution and
circumspection, States may be pressured into attempting
compliance on the cheap, placing marginal patients into
integrated settings devoid of the services and attention
necessary for their condition. This danger is in addition to
the federalism costs inherent in referring state decisions
regarding the administration of treatment programs and
the allocation of resources to the reviewing authority of
the federal courts. It is of central importance, then, that
courts apply today's decision with great deference to the
medical decisions of the responsible, treating physicians
and, as the Court makes clear, with appropriate deference
to the program funding decisions of state policymakers.

II
With these reservations made explicit, in my view wemust remand the case for a determination of the questions

the Court poses and for a determination whether respond-ents can show a violation of 42 U. S. C. $ 12132's ban on discrimination based on the summary judgment materials onfile or any further pleadings and materials properly allowed.

At the outset it should be noted there is no allegationthat Georgia officials acted on the basis of animus or unfair
stereotypes regarding the disabled. Underlying much dis-crimination law is the notion that animus can lead to false
and unjustified stereotypes, and vice versa. Of course, theline between animus and stereotype is often indistinct,
and it is not always necessary to distinguish between them.Section 12132 can be understood to deem as irrational, and
so to prohibit, distinctions by which a class of disabledpersons, or some within that class, are, by reason of their
disability and without adequate justification, exposed by astate entity to more onerous treatment than a comparison
group in the provision of services or the administration ofexisting programs, or indeed entirely excluded from state
programs or facilities. Discrimination under this statutemight in principle be shown in the case before us, though
further proceedings should be required.Putting aside issues of animus or unfair stereotype, I agree
with Justice Thomas that on the ordinary interpretationand meaning of the term, one who alleges discrimination
must show that she "received differential treatment vis-a` -vismembers of a different group on the basis of a statutorily
described characteristic." Post, at 616 (dissenting opinion).In my view, however, discrimination so defined might be
shown here. Although the Court seems to reject Justice
Thomas' definition of discrimination, ante, at 598, it assertsthat unnecessary institutional care does lead to "[d]issimilar

treatment," ante, at 601. According to the Court, "[i]n orderto receive needed medical services, persons with mental dis527US2 Unit: $U88 [05-03-01 13:21:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN
612 OLMSTEAD v. L. C.

Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
abilities must, because of those disabilities, relinquish partic-ipation in community life they could enjoy given reasonable

accommodations, while persons without mental disabilitiescan receive the medical services they need without similar
sacrifice." Ibid.

Although this point is not discussed at length by the Court,it does serve to suggest the theory under which respondents

might be subject to discrimination in violation of $ 12132. Ifthey could show that persons needing psychiatric or other
medical services to treat a mental disability are subject to amore onerous condition than are persons eligible for other
existing state medical services, and if removal of the condition would not be a fundamental alteration of a program
or require the creation of a new one, then the beginnings of
a discrimination case would be established. In terms more
specific to this case, if respondents could show that Georgia
(i) provides treatment to individuals suffering from medical
problems of comparable seriousness, (ii) as a general matter,
does so in the most integrated setting appropriate for the
treatment of those problems (taking medical and other practical considerations into account), but (iii) without adequate
justification, fails to do so for a group of mentally disabled
persons (treating them instead in separate, locked institutional facilities), I believe it would demonstrate discrimination on the basis of mental disability.

Of course, it is a quite different matter to say that a State
without a program in place is required to create one. No
State has unlimited resources, and each must make hard decisions on how much to allocate to treatment of diseases
and disabilities. If, for example, funds for care and treatment of the mentally ill, including the severely mentally ill,
are reduced in order to support programs directed to the
treatment and care of other disabilities, the decision may be
unfortunate. The judgment, however, is a political one and
not within the reach of the statute. Grave constitutional
concerns are raised when a federal court is given the author527US2 Unit: $U88 [05-03-01 13:21:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN

613Cite as: 527 U. S. 581 (1999)
Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
ity to review the State's choices in basic matters such asestablishing or declining to establish new programs. It is

not reasonable to read the ADA to permit court interventionin these decisions. In addition, as the Court notes,

ante,
at 592, by regulation a public entity is required only to make
"reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or proce-dures" when necessary to avoid discrimination and is not

even required to make those if "the modifications wouldfundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or
activity." 28 CFR $ 35.130(b)(7) (1998). It follows that aState may not be forced to create a community-treatment
program where none exists. See Brief for United States
as Amicus Curiae 19-20, and n. 3. Whether a different
statutory scheme would exceed constitutional limits need
not be addressed.

Discrimination, of course, tends to be an expansive concept and, as legal category, it must be applied with care and
prudence. On any reasonable reading of the statute, $ 12132
cannot cover all types of differential treatment of disabled
and nondisabled persons, no matter how minimal or innocuous. To establish discrimination in the context of this
case, and absent a showing of policies motivated by improper
animus or stereotypes, it would be necessary to show that a
comparable or similarly situated group received differential
treatment. Regulations are an important tool in identifying the kinds of contexts, policies, and practices that raise
concerns under the ADA. The congressional findings in 42
U. S. C. $ 12101 also serve as a useful aid for courts to discern
the sorts of discrimination with which Congress was concerned. Indeed, those findings have clear bearing on the
issues raised in this case, and support the conclusion that
unnecessary institutionalization may be the evidence or the
result of the discrimination the ADA prohibits.

Unlike Justice Thomas, I deem it relevant and instructive that Congress in express terms identified the "isolat[ion]
and segregat[ion]" of disabled persons by society as a "for[m]

of discrimination," $$ 12101(a)(2), (5), and noted that discrim-ination against the disabled "persists in such critical areas

as . . . institutionalization," $ 12101(a)(3). These findings donot show that segregation and institutionalization are always
discriminatory or that segregation or institutionalization are,
by their nature, forms of prohibited discrimination. Nor dothey necessitate a regime in which individual treatment

plans are required, as distinguished from broad and reason-able classifications for the provision of health care services.
Instead, they underscore Congress' concern that discrimi-nation has been a frequent and pervasive problem in institutional settings and policies and its concern that segregating
disabled persons from others can be discriminatory. Both of
those concerns are consistent with the normal definition of
discrimination--differential treatment of similarly situated
groups. The findings inform application of that definition
in specific cases, but absent guidance to the contrary, there
is no reason to think they displace it. The issue whether
respondents have been discriminated against under $ 12132
by institutionalized treatment cannot be decided in the abstract, divorced from the facts surrounding treatment programs in their State.

The possibility therefore remains that, on the facts of this
case, respondents would be able to support a claim under

$ 12132 by showing that they have been subject to discrimination by Georgia officials on the basis of their disability.
This inquiry would not be simple. Comparisons of different medical conditions and the corresponding treatment
regimens might be difficult, as would be assessments of
the degree of integration of various settings in which medical treatment is offered. For example, the evidence might
show that, apart from services for the mentally disabled,
medical treatment is rarely offered in a community setting
but also is rarely offered in facilities comparable to state
mental hospitals. Determining the relevance of that type
of evidence would require considerable judgment and anal527US2 Unit: $U88 [05-03-01 13:21:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ysis. However, as petitioners observe, "[i]n this case, noclass of similarly situated individuals was even identified,

let alone shown to be given preferential treatment." Brief
for Petitioners 21. Without additional information regarding the details of state-provided medical services in Georgia,
we cannot address the issue in the way the statute demands.
As a consequence, the judgment of the courts below, granting partial summary judgment to respondents, ought not to
be sustained. In addition, as Justice Ginsburg's opinion
is careful to note, ante, at 604, it was error in the earlier proceedings to restrict the relevance and force of the State's evidence regarding the comparative costs of treatment. The
State is entitled to wide discretion in adopting its own systems of cost analysis, and, if it chooses, to allocate health care
resources based on fixed and overhead costs for whole institutions and programs. We must be cautious when we seek
to infer specific rules limiting States' choices when Congress
has used only general language in the controlling statute.

I would remand the case to the Court of Appeals or the District Court for it to determine in the first instance whether a
statutory violation is sufficiently alleged and supported in respondents' summary judgment materials and, if not, whether

they should be given leave to replead and to introduce evidence and argument along the lines suggested above.

For these reasons, I concur in the judgment of the Court.

Justice Thomas, with whom The Chief Justice and
Justice Scalia join, dissenting.

Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990
(ADA), 104 Stat. 337, as set forth in 42 U. S. C. $ 12132,
provides:

"Subject to the provisions of this subchapter, no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such
disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities

of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination byany such entity." (Emphasis added.)

The majority concludes that petitioners "discriminated"against respondents--as a matter of law--by continuing to
treat them in an institutional setting after they becameeligible for community placement. I disagree. Temporary
exclusion from community placement does not amount to"discrimination" in the traditional sense of the word, nor
have respondents shown that petitioners "discriminated"against them "by reason of " their disabilities.

Until today, this Court has never endorsed an interpre-tation of the term "discrimination" that encompassed disparate treatment among members of the same protectedclass. Discrimination, as typically understood, requires a
showing that a claimant received differential treatment vis-a` -vis members of a different group on the basis of a statutorily described characteristic. This interpretation com-ports with dictionary definitions of the term discrimination,
which means to "distinguish," to "differentiate," or to makea "distinction in favor of or against, a person or thing based
on the group, class, or category to which that person or thingbelongs rather than on individual merit." Random House
Dictionary 564 (2d ed. 1987); see also Webster's Third NewInternational Dictionary 648 (1981) (defining "discrimination" as "the making or perceiving of a distinction or differ-ence" or as "the act, practice, or an instance of discriminating
categorically rather than individually").Our decisions construing various statutory prohibitions
against "discrimination" have not wavered from this path.The best place to begin is with Title VII of the Civil Rights
Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 253, as amended, the paradigmatic anti-discrimination law.

42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-2(a)(1) (emphasis added). We have ex-plained that this language is designed "to achieve equality
of employment opportunities and remove barriers that haveoperated in the past to favor an identifiable group of white
employees over other employees." Griggs v. Duke Power
Co., 401 U. S. 424, 429-430 (1971).2Under Title VII, a finding of discrimination requires a

comparison of otherwise similarly situated persons who arein different groups by reason of certain characteristics provided by statute. See, e. g., Newport News Shipbuilding& Dry Dock Co. v. EEOC, 462 U. S. 669, 683 (1983) (explainpublic contracts. See Saint Francis College v. Al-Khazraji, 481 U. S.
604, 609 (1987). This Court has applied the "framework" developed in
Title VII cases to claims brought under this statute. Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164, 186 (1989). Also, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, 81 Stat. 602, as amended, 29 U. S. C.

$ 623(a)(1), prohibits discrimination on the basis of an employee's age.
This Court has noted that its "interpretation of Title VII . . . applies
with equal force in the context of age discrimination, for the substantive
provisions of the ADEA `were derived in haec verba from Title VII.' "
Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston, 469 U. S. 111, 121 (1985) (quoting
Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U. S. 575, 584 (1978)). This Court has also looked
to its Title VII interpretations of discrimination in illuminating Title IX
of the Education Amendments of 1972, 86 Stat. 373, as amended, 20 U. S. C.

$ 1681 et seq., which prohibits discrimination under any federally funded
education program or activity. See Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public
Schools, 503 U. S. 60, 75 (1992) (relying on Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v.
Vinson, 477 U. S. 57 (1986), a Title VII case, in determining that sexual
harassment constitutes discrimination).

2 This Court has recognized that two forms of discrimination are prohibited under Title VII: disparate treatment and disparate impact. See
Griggs, 401 U. S., at 431 ("The Act proscribes not only overt discrimination
but also practices that are fair in form, but discriminatory in operation").
Both forms of "discrimination" require a comparison among classes of
employees.

ing that Title VII discrimination occurs when an employee
is treated " `in a manner which but for that person's sex
would be different' ") (quoting Los Angeles Dept. of Water
and Power v. Manhart, 435 U. S. 702, 711 (1978)). For this
reason, we have described as "nonsensical" the comparison of the racial composition of different classes of job categories in determining whether there existed disparate impact discrimination with respect to a particular job category.
Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio, 490 U. S. 642, 651 (1989).3
Courts interpreting Title VII have held that a plaintiff cannot prove "discrimination" by demonstrating that one member of a particular protected group has been favored over
another member of that same group. See, e. g., Bush v.
Commonwealth Edison Co., 990 F. 2d 928, 931 (CA7 1993),
cert. denied, 511 U. S. 1071 (1994) (explaining that under
Title VII, a fired black employee "had to show that although
he was not a good employee, equally bad employees were
treated more leniently by [his employer] if they happened
not to be black").

Our cases interpreting $ 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of
1973, 87 Stat. 394, as amended, which prohibits "discrimination" against certain individuals with disabilities, have applied this commonly understood meaning of discrimination.
Section 504 provides:

burden of proof with respect to a disparate impact discrimination claim.
See id., $ 105 (codified at 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-2(k)). This change highlights
the principle that a departure from the traditional understanding of discrimination requires congressional action. Cf. Field v. Mans, 516 U. S.
59, 69-70 (1995) (Congress legislates against the background rule of the
common law and traditional notions of lawful conduct).

jected to discrimination under any program or activityreceiving Federal financial assistance."

In keeping with the traditional paradigm, we have alwayslimited the application of the term "discrimination" in the
Rehabilitation Act to a person who is a member of a pro-tected group and faces discrimination "by reason of his
handicap." Indeed, we previously rejected the argumentthat $ 504 requires the type of "affirmative efforts to overcome the disabilities caused by handicaps," Southeastern
Community College v. Davis, 442 U. S. 397, 410 (1979), thatthe majority appears to endorse today. Instead, we found

that $ 504 required merely "the evenhanded treatment ofhandicapped persons" relative to those persons who do not
have disabilities. Ibid. Our conclusion was informed bythe fact that some provisions of the Rehabilitation Act envision "affirmative action" on behalf of those individualswith disabilities, but $ 504 itself "does not refer at all" to
such action. Ibid. Therefore, "[a] comparison of these pro-visions demonstrates that Congress understood accommodation of the needs of handicapped individuals may requireaffirmative action and knew how to provide for it in those
instances where it wished to do so." Id., at 411.Similarly, in

Alexander v. Choate, 469 U. S. 287, 302 (1985),we found no discrimination under $ 504 with respect to a

limit on inpatient hospital care that was "neutral on its face"and did not "distinguish between those whose coverage will
be reduced and those whose coverage will not on the basisof any test, judgment, or trait that the handicapped as a
class are less capable of meeting or less likely of having,"
id., at 302. We said that $ 504 does "not . . . guarantee thehandicapped equal results from the provision of state Medicaid, even assuming some measure of equality of healthcould be constructed."

Id., at 304.Likewise, in Traynor v. Turnage, 485 U. S. 535, 548 (1988),

we reiterated that the purpose of $ 504 is to guarantee thatindividuals with disabilities receive "evenhanded treatment"

Thomas, J., dissenting
relative to those persons without disabilities. In Traynor,the Court upheld a Veterans' Administration regulation that

excluded "primary alcoholics" from a benefit that was ex-tended to persons disabled by alcoholism related to a mental
disorder. Id., at 551. In so doing, the Court noted that
"[t]his litigation does not involve a program or activity thatis alleged to treat handicapped persons less favorably than

nonhandicapped persons." Id., at 548. Given the theory ofthe case, the Court explicitly held: "There is nothing in the
Rehabilitation Act that requires that any benefit extendedto one category of handicapped persons also be extended to
all other categories of handicapped persons." Id., at 549.

This same understanding of discrimination also informs
this Court's constitutional interpretation of the term. See
General Motors Corp. v. Tracy, 519 U. S. 278, 298 (1997)
(noting with respect to interpreting the Commerce Clause,
"[c]onceptually, of course, any notion of discrimination assumes a comparison of substantially similar entities"); Yick
Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U. S. 356, 374 (1886) (condemning under

the Fourteenth Amendment "illegal discriminations between persons in similar circumstances"); see also Adarand
Constructors, Inc. v. Pen~ a, 515 U. S. 200, 223-224 (1995);
Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469, 493-494 (1989)
(plurality opinion).

Despite this traditional understanding, the majority derives a more "comprehensive" definition of "discrimination,"
as that term is used in Title II of the ADA, one that includes
"institutional isolation of persons with disabilities." Ante,
at 600. It chiefly relies on certain congressional findings
contained within the ADA. To be sure, those findings appear to equate institutional isolation with segregation, and
thereby discrimination. See ibid. (quoting $$ 12101(a)(2)
and 12101(a)(5), both of which explicitly identify "segregation" of persons with disabilities as a form of "discrimination"); see also ante, at 588-589. The congressional findings,
however, are written in general, hortatory terms and pro527US2 Unit: $U88 [05-03-01 13:21:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN

vide little guidance to the interpretation of the specific lan-guage of $ 12132. See National Organization for Women,

Inc. v. Scheidler, 510 U. S. 249, 260 (1994) ("We also thinkthat the quoted statement of congressional findings is a
rather thin reed upon which to base a requirement"). Inmy view, the vague congressional findings upon which the
majority relies simply do not suffice to show that Congresssought to overturn a well-established understanding of a
statutory term (here, "discrimination").4 Moreover, the ma-jority fails to explain why terms in the findings should be
given a medical content, pertaining to the place where amentally retarded person is treated. When read in context,
the findings instead suggest that terms such as "segregation"were used in a more general sense, pertaining to matters
such as access to employment, facilities, and transportation.Absent a clear directive to the contrary, we must read "discrimination" in light of the common understanding of theterm. We cannot expand the meaning of the term "discrimination" in order to invalidate policies we may find unfortu-nate. Cf. NLRB v. Highland Park Mfg. Co., 341 U. S. 322,
325 (1951) (explaining that if Congress intended statutoryterms "to have other than their ordinarily accepted meaning,

4 If such general hortatory language is sufficient, it is puzzling that this
or any other court did not reach the same conclusion long ago by reference
to the general purpose language of the Rehabilitation Act itself. See 29
U. S. C. $ 701 (1988 ed.) (describing the statute's purpose as "to develop
and implement, through research, training, services, and the guarantee of
equal opportunity, comprehensive and coordinated programs of vocational
rehabilitation and independent living, for individuals with handicaps in
order to maximize their employability, independence, and integration
into the workplace and the community" (emphasis added)). Further, this
section has since been amended to proclaim in even more aspirational
terms that the policy under the statute is driven by, inter alia, "respect
for individual dignity, personal responsibility, self-determination, and pursuit of meaningful careers, based on informed choice, of individuals with
disabilities," "respect for the privacy, rights, and equal access," and "inclusion, integration, and full participation of the individuals." 29 U. S. C.

it would and should have given them a special meaning by
definition").5

Elsewhere in the ADA, Congress chose to alter the traditional definition of discrimination. Title I of the ADA,

$ 12112(b)(1), defines discrimination to include "limiting, segregating, or classifying a job applicant or employee in a way
that adversely affects the opportunities or status of such applicant or employee." Notably, however, Congress did not
provide that this definition of discrimination, unlike other
aspects of the ADA, applies to Title II. Ordinary canons of
construction require that we respect the limited applicability of this definition of "discrimination" and not import it
into other parts of the law where Congress did not see fit.
See, e. g., Bates v. United States, 522 U. S. 23, 29-30 (1997)
(" `Where Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same
Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion' ")
(quoting Russello v. United States, 464 U. S. 16, 23 (1983)).
The majority's definition of discrimination--although not
specifically delineated--substantially imports the definition
of Title I into Title II by necessarily assuming that it is
sufficient to focus exclusively on members of one particular

5 Given my conclusion, the Court need not review the integration regulation promulgated by the Attorney General. See 28 CFR $ 35.130(d)
(1998). Deference to a regulation is appropriate only " `if Congress has
not expressed its intent with respect to the question, and then only if
the administrative interpretation is reasonable.' " Reno v. Bossier Parish
School Bd., 520 U. S. 471, 483 (1997) (quoting Presley v. Etowah County
Comm'n, 502 U. S. 491, 508 (1992)). Here, Congress has expressed its
intent in $ 12132, and the Attorney General's regulation--insofar as it
contradicts the settled meaning of the statutory term--cannot prevail
against it. See NLRB v. Town & Country Elec., Inc., 516 U. S. 85, 94
(1995) (explaining that courts interpreting a term within a statute "must
infer, unless the statute otherwise dictates, that Congress means to incorporate the established meaning of that term" (internal quotation marks
omitted)).

group. Under this view, discrimination occurs when some
members of a protected group are treated differently from
other members of that same group. As the preceding discussion emphasizes, absent a special definition supplied by
Congress, this conclusion is a remarkable and novel proposition that finds no support in our decisions in analogous areas.
For example, the majority's conclusion that petitioners "discriminated" against respondents is the equivalent to finding
discrimination under Title VII where a black employee with
deficient management skills is denied in-house training by
his employer (allegedly because of lack of funding) because
other similarly situated black employees are given the inhouse training. Such a claim would fly in the face of our
prior case law, which requires more than the assertion that
a person belongs to a protected group and did not receive
some benefit. See, e. g., Griggs, 401 U. S., at 430-431 ("Congress did not intend by Title VII, however, to guarantee a
job to every person regardless of qualifications. In short,
the Act does not command that any person be hired simply
because he was formerly the subject of discrimination, or
because he is a member of a minority group").

At bottom, the type of claim approved of by the majority
does not concern a prohibition against certain conduct (the
traditional understanding of discrimination), but rather concerns imposition of a standard of care.6 As such, the major6 In mandating that government agencies minimize the institutional
isolation of disabled individuals, the majority appears to appropriate the
concept of "mainstreaming" from the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), 84 Stat. 175, as amended, 20 U. S. C. $ 1400 et seq.
But IDEA is not an antidiscrimination law. It is a grant program that
affirmatively requires States accepting federal funds to provide disabled children with a "free appropriate public education" and to establish
"procedures to assure that, to the maximum extent appropriate, children
with disabilities . . . are educated with children who are not disabled."

$$ 1412(1), (5). Ironically, even under this broad affirmative mandate, we
previously rejected a claim that IDEA required the "standard of care"

ity can offer no principle limiting this new species of "dis-crimination" claim apart from an affirmative defense because

it looks merely to an individual in isolation, without compar-ing him to otherwise similarly situated persons, and determines that discrimination occurs merely because that individual does not receive the treatment he wishes to receive.By adopting such a broad view of discrimination, the majority drains the term of any meaning other than as a proxy fordecisions disapproved of by this Court.

Further, I fear that the majority's approach imposes sig-nificant federalism costs, directing States how to make decisions about their delivery of public services. We previouslyhave recognized that constitutional principles of federalism erect limits on the Federal Government's ability to direct state officers or to interfere with the functions of stategovernments. See,

e. g., Printz v. United States, 521 U. S.
898 (1997); New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144 (1992).
We have suggested that these principles specifically apply to
whether States are required to provide a certain level of
benefits to individuals with disabilities. As noted in Alexander, in rejecting a similar theory under $ 504 of the Rehabilitation Act: "[N]othing . . . suggests that Congress
desired to make major inroads on the States' longstanding
discretion to choose the proper mix of amount, scope, and
duration limitations on services . . . ." 469 U. S., at 307.
See also Bowen v. American Hospital Assn., 476 U. S. 610,
642 (1986) (plurality opinion) ("[N]othing in [$ 504] authorizes [the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS)]

not field offices of the HHS bureaucracy, and they may notbe conscripted against their will as the foot soldiers in a

federal crusade"). The majority's affirmative defense willlikely come as cold comfort to the States that will now be
forced to defend themselves in federal court every time resources prevent the immediate placement of a qualified in-dividual. In keeping with our traditional deference in this

area, see Alexander, supra, the appropriate course wouldbe to respect the States' historical role as the dominant
authority responsible for providing services to individualswith disabilities.

The majority may remark that it actually does properly
compare members of different groups. Indeed, the majority
mentions in passing the "[d]issimilar treatment" of persons
with and without disabilities. Ante, at 601. It does so in
the context of supporting its conclusion that institutional
isolation is a form of discrimination. It cites two cases as
standing for the unremarkable proposition that discrimination leads to deleterious stereotyping, ante, at 600 (citing
Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737, 755 (1984); Manhart, 435 U. S.,

at 707, n. 13)), and an amicus brief which indicates that
confinement diminishes certain everyday life activities, ante,
at 601 (citing Brief for American Psychiatric Association
et al. as Amici Curiae 20-22). The majority then observes
that persons without disabilities "can receive the services
they need without" institutionalization and thereby avoid
these twin deleterious effects. Ante, at 601. I do not quarrel with the two general propositions, but I fail to see how
they assist in resolving the issue before the Court. Further,
the majority neither specifies what services persons with disabilities might need nor contends that persons without disabilities need the same services as those with disabilities,
leading to the inference that the dissimilar treatment the
majority observes results merely from the fact that different
classes of persons receive different services--not from "discrimination" as traditionally defined.

Finally, it is also clear petitioners did not "discriminate"against respondents "by reason of [their] disabili[ties]," as

$ 12132 requires. We have previously interpreted the phrase"by reason of " as requiring proximate causation. See, e. g.,
Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corporation, 503U. S. 258, 265-266 (1992); see also

id., at 266, n. 11 (citationof cases). Such an interpretation is in keeping with the vernacular understanding of the phrase. See American Heri-tage Dictionary 1506 (3d ed. 1992) (defining "by reason of "
as "because of "). This statute should be read as requir-ing proximate causation as well. Respondents do not contend that their disabilities constituted the proximate causefor their exclusion. Nor could they--community placement
simply is not available to those without disabilities. Con-tinued institutional treatment of persons who, though now
deemed treatable in a community placement, must wait theirturn for placement does not establish that the denial of community placement occurred "by reason of " their disability.Rather, it establishes no more than the fact that petitioners
have limited resources.

For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.

v. COLLEGE SAVINGSBANK

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe federal circuit

No. 98-531. Argued April 20, 1999--Decided June 23, 1999
After the Patent and Plant Variety Protection Remedy Clarification Act

(Act) amended the patent laws to expressly abrogate the States' sovereign immunity, respondent College Savings Bank filed a patent infringement suit against petitioner Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Education
Expenses Board (Florida Prepaid), a Florida state entity. When this
Court decided Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44, Florida
Prepaid moved to dismiss the action, claiming that the Act was an
unconstitutional attempt by Congress to use its Article I powers to
abrogate state sovereign immunity. College Savings countered that
Congress had properly exercised its power pursuant to $ 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment in order to enforce the due process guarantees in

$ 1 of the Amendment. The United States intervened to defend the
statute's constitutionality. Agreeing with College Savings, the District
Court denied the motion, and the Federal Circuit affirmed.

Held: The Act's abrogation of States' sovereign immunity is invalid

because it cannot be sustained as legislation enacted to enforce the
guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause.
Pp. 634-648.

(a) Florida has not expressly consented to suit, or impliedly waived
its immunity, see College Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd., post, p. 666. To determine whether the Act nonetheless validly abrogated that immunity, the Court must ask: first,
whether Congress has " `unequivocally expresse[d] its intent to abrogate,' " and second, whether Congress acted " `pursuant to a valid exercise of power.' " Seminole Tribe, supra, at 55. Congress clearly made
known its intent to abrogate in the Act. Whether it had the power

to do so is another matter. In Seminole Tribe, this Court held that
Congress does not have such power under Article I but reaffirmed its
holding in Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U. S. 445, that Congress has such
power under $ 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. Thus, legislation that
is "appropriate" under $ 5, as that term was construed in City of Boerne
v. Flores, 521 U. S. 507, could abrogate state sovereignty. Since Congress' enforcement power is remedial, id., at 519, to invoke $ 5, Congress

must identify conduct transgressing the Fourteenth Amendment's substantive provisions, and must tailor its legislative scheme to remedying
or preventing such conduct. Pp. 634-639.

(b) Here, the underlying conduct is unremedied patent infringement
by States. However, in enacting the Act, Congress identified no pattern of such infringement, let alone a pattern of constitutional violations.
The House Report provided only two examples of patent infringement
suits against States, and the Federal Circuit identified only eight such
suits in 110 years. Testimony before the House Subcommittee acknowledged that States are willing and able to respect patent rights,
and the Senate Report contains no evidence that unremedied patent
infringement by States had become a problem of national import.
Pp. 639-641.

(c) Although patents may be considered property within the meaning
of the Due Process Clause, the legislative record still provides little
support for the proposition that Congress sought to remedy a Fourteenth Amendment violation in enacting the Act. Under the plain
terms of the Due Process Clause and the clear import of this Court's
precedent, a State's infringement of a patent violates the Constitution
only where the State provides no remedy, or only inadequate remedies,
to injured patent owners for its infringement of their patent. Congress, however, barely considered the availability of state remedies for
patent infringement. The primary point made by the limited testimony
on state remedies was not whether the remedies were constitutionally
inadequate, but rather that they were less convenient than federal remedies and might undermine the uniformity of patent law. Congress itself
said nothing about the existence or adequacy of state remedies in the
statute or the Senate Report. The need for uniformity in patent law
construction, though undoubtedly important, is a factor belonging to the
Article I patent-power calculus. Moreover, a state actor's negligent act
causing unintended injury to a person's property does not "deprive" that
person of property within the meaning of the Due Process Clause, and
the record suggests that state infringement of patents was at worst
innocent. The legislative record thus suggests that the Act does not
respond to a history of widespread and persisting deprivation of constitutional rights of the sort Congress has faced in enacting proper prophylactic $ 5 legislation. Because of the lack of legislative support for Congress' conclusion, the Act's provisions are so out of proportion to the
supposed remedy or preventive object that they cannot be understood
as responsive to, or designed to prevent, unconstitutional behavior.
Congress did not limit the Act's coverage to cases involving arguable
constitutional violations or confine its reach by limiting the remedy to
certain types of infringement. Instead Congress made all States immediately amenable to federal-court suits for all kinds of possible patent

and more basic aims--to present a uniform remedy for patent infringement and place States on the same footing as private parties under that
regime--are proper Article I concerns, but that Article does not give
Congress the power to enact such legislation after Seminole Tribe.

Opinion of the Court

Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of theCourt.

In 1992, Congress amended the patent laws and expresslyabrogated the States' sovereign immunity from claims of patent infringement. Respondent College Savings then suedthe State of Florida for patent infringement, and the Court
of Appeals held that Congress had validly abrogated theState's sovereign immunity from infringement suits pursuant to its authority under $ 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.We hold that, under

City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U. S. 507(1997), the statute cannot be sustained as legislation enacted

to enforce the guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment'sDue Process Clause, and accordingly reverse the decision of
the Court of Appeals. I

See Fla. Stat. $ 240.551(1) (Supp. 1998). College Savingsclaims that, in the course of administering its tuition prepayment program, Florida Prepaid directly and indirectlyinfringed College Savings' patent.

College Savings brought an infringement action under 35U. S. C. $ 271(a) against Florida Prepaid in the United States
District Court for the District of New Jersey in November1994.

had already passed the Patent and Plant Variety ProtectionRemedy Clarification Act (Patent Remedy Act), 35 U. S. C.

cadero State Hosp. v. Scanlon, 473 U. S. 234, 242-243 (1985),the Federal Circuit had held that the patent laws failed to

contain the requisite statement of intent to abrogate statesovereign immunity from infringement suits. See, e. g.,
Chew v. California, 893 F. 2d 331 (1989). In response to
Chew and similar decisions, Congress enacted the PatentRemedy Act to "clarify that States, instrumentalities of

States, and officers and employees of States acting in theirofficial capacity, are subject to suit in Federal court by any
person for infringement of patents and plant variety protec-tions." Pub. L. 102-560, preamble, 106 Stat. 4230; see also
H. R. Rep. No. 101-960, pt. 1, pp. 7, 33 (1990) (hereinafterH. R. Rep.); S. Rep. No. 102-280, pp. 1, 5-6 (1992) (hereinafter S. Rep.). Section 271(h) now states: "As used in thissection, the term `whoever' includes any State, any instrumentality of a State, and any officer or employee of a Stateor instrumentality of a State acting in his official capacity."
Section 296(a) addresses the sovereign immunity issue evenmore specifically:

"Any State, any instrumentality of a State, and any offi-cer or employee of a State or instrumentality of a State
acting in his official capacity, shall not be immune, underthe eleventh amendment of the Constitution of the
United States or under any other doctrine of sovereignimmunity, from suit in Federal court by any person . . .
for infringement of a patent under section 271, or forany other violation under this title."

Relying on these provisions, College Savings alleged thatFlorida Prepaid had willfully infringed its patent under

combination or composition, or a material or apparatus for use in practicing a patented process, constituting a material part of the invention, knowing the same to be especially made or especially adapted for use in an
infringement of such patent, and not a staple article or commodity of commerce suitable for substantial noninfringing use, shall be liable as a contributory infringer." 35 U. S. C. $ 271 (1994 ed. and Supp. III).

Prepaid argued that the Patent Remedy Act was an uncon-stitutional attempt by Congress to use its Article I powers

to abrogate state sovereign immunity. College Savingsresponded that Congress had properly exercised its power

pursuant to $ 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to enforcethe guarantees of the Due Process Clause in $ 1 of the
Amendment. The United States intervened to defend theconstitutionality of the statute. Agreeing with College Savings, the District Court denied Florida Prepaid's motion todismiss, 948 F. Supp. 400 (N. J. 1996), and the Federal Circuit
affirmed, 148 F. 3d 1343 (1998).The Federal Circuit held that Congress had clearly expressed its intent to abrogate the States' immunity from suitin federal court for patent infringement, and that Congress
had the power under $ 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment todo so.

Id., at 1347. The court reasoned that patents areproperty subject to the protections of the Due Process

Clause and that Congress' objective in enacting the PatentRemedy Act was permissible because it sought to prevent
States from depriving patent owners of this property with-out due process. See id., at 1349-1350. The court rejected
Florida Prepaid's argument that it and other States had notdeprived patent owners of their property

without due proc-ess, and refused to "deny Congress the authority to subject

all states to suit for patent infringement in the federalcourts, regardless of the extent of procedural due process
that may exist at any particular time." Id., at 1351. Fi3 The District Court concluded that, for purposes of immunity from suit,
Florida Prepaid is an arm of the State of Florida, a conclusion the parties
did not dispute before either the Federal Circuit or this Court.

"Although the text of the Amendment would appear to
restrict only the Article III diversity jurisdiction of

the federal courts, `we have understood the Eleventh
Amendment to stand not so much for what it says, but
for the presupposition . . . which it confirms.' That presupposition, first observed over a century ago in Hans
v. Louisiana, 134 U. S. 1 (1890), has two parts: first, that
each State is a sovereign entity in our federal system;
and second, that ` "[i]t is inherent in the nature of sovereignty not to be amenable to the suit of an individual
without its consent." ' Id., at 13 (emphasis deleted),
quoting The Federalist No. 81 . . . . For over a century
we have reaffirmed that federal jurisdiction over suits

the Constitution when establishing the judicial power ofthe United States.' Hans, supra, at 15."

Here, College Savings sued the State of Florida in federalcourt, and it is undisputed that Florida has not expressly
consented to suit. College Savings and the United Statesargue that Florida has impliedly waived its immunity under
Parden v. Terminal R. Co. of Ala. Docks Dept., 377 U. S.184 (1964). That argument, however, is foreclosed by our
decision in the companion case overruling the constructivewaiver theory announced in

Parden. See College SavingsBank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd.,

post, p. 666.College Savings and the United States nonetheless contend that Congress' enactment of the Patent Remedy Actvalidly abrogated the States' sovereign immunity. To determine the merits of this proposition, we must answertwo questions: "first, whether Congress has `unequivocally
expresse[d] its intent to abrogate the immunity,' . . . andsecond, whether Congress has acted `pursuant to a valid
exercise of power.' " Seminole Tribe, supra, at 55. Weagree with the parties and the Federal Circuit that in enacting the Patent Remedy Act, Congress has made its intentionto abrogate the States' immunity " `unmistakably clear in the
language of the statute.' " Dellmuth v. Muth, 491 U. S. 223,228 (1989). Indeed, Congress' intent to abrogate could not
have been any clearer. See 35 U. S. C. $ 296(a) ("Any State. . . shall not be immune, under the eleventh amendment of
the Constitution of the United States or under any otherdoctrine of sovereign immunity, from suit in Federal court
. . . for infringement of a patent").Whether Congress had the power to compel States to
surrender their sovereign immunity for these purposes,however, is another matter. Congress justified the Patent
Remedy Act under three sources of constitutional authority:the Patent Clause, Art. I, $ 8, cl. 8; the Interstate Commerce
Clause, Art. I, $ 8, cl. 3; and $ 5 of the Fourteenth Amend527US2 Unit: $U89 [05-09-01 13:05:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN

state sovereign immunity pursuant to an Article I power(the Commerce Clause). 517 U. S., at 72-73.

SeminoleTribe makes clear that Congress may not abrogate state sovereign immunity pursuant to its Article I powers; hence thePatent Remedy Act cannot be sustained under either the
Commerce Clause or the Patent Clause. Ibid. The FederalCircuit recognized this, and College Savings and the United
States do not contend otherwise.Instead, College Savings and the United States argue that
the Federal Circuit properly concluded that Congressenacted the Patent Remedy Act to secure the Fourteenth
Amendment's protections against deprivations of propertywithout due process of law. The Fourteenth Amendment
provides in relevant part:

"Section 1. . . . No State shall . . . deprive any per-son of life, liberty, or property, without due process of

law. . . . . .

"Section 5. The Congress shall have power to en-force, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this

Opinion of the Court
Seminole Tribe also reaffirmed its holding in Fitzpatrick v.
Bitzer, 427 U. S. 445 (1976), that Congress retains the authority to abrogate state sovereign immunity pursuant to theFourteenth Amendment. Our opinion explained that in

Fitzpatrick, "we recognized that the Fourteenth Amendment, by expanding federal power at the expense of stateautonomy, had fundamentally altered the balance of state

and federal power struck by the Constitution." Seminole
Tribe, supra, at 59. The Court further described Fitzpatrick as holding that "through the Fourteenth Amendment,federal power extended to intrude upon the province of the

Eleventh Amendment and therefore that $ 5 of the Four-teenth Amendment allowed Congress to abrogate the immunity from suit guaranteed by that Amendment." Seminole
Tribe, supra, at 59.College Savings and the United States are correct in

suggesting that "appropriate" legislation pursuant to theEnforcement Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment could
abrogate state sovereignty. Congress itself apparentlythought the Patent Remedy Act could be so justified:

"[T]he bill is justified as an acceptable method of en-forcing the provisions of the fourteenth amendment.
The Court in Lemelson v. Ampex Corp.[, 372 F. Supp.708 (ND Ill. 1974),] recognized that a patent is a form of
property, holding that a right to compensation exists forpatent infringement. Additionally, because courts have
continually recognized patent rights as property, the
fourteenth amendment prohibits a State from deprivinga person of property without due process of law."

S. Rep., at 8 (footnotes omitted).
We have held that "[t]he `provisions of this article,' to which

$ 5 refers, include the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment." City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U. S., at 519.

But the legislation must nonetheless be "appropriate"
under $ 5 as that term was construed in City of Boerne.

BD. v. COLLEGE SAVINGS BANK

Opinion of the Court

There, this Court held that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA), 107 Stat. 1488, 42 U. S. C. $ 2000bb
et seq., exceeded Congress' authority under $ 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, insofar as RFRA was made applicable
to the States. RFRA was enacted "in direct response to"
this Court's decision in Employment Div., Dept. of Human
Resources of Ore. v. Smith, 494 U. S. 872 (1990), which construed the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to
hold that "neutral, generally applicable laws may be applied
to religious practices even when not supported by a compelling governmental interest." City of Boerne, supra, at 512,
514. Through RFRA, Congress reinstated the compelling
governmental interest test eschewed by Smith by requiring
that a generally applicable law placing a "substantial burden" on the free exercise of religion must be justified by a
"compelling governmental interest" and must employ the
"least restrictive means" of furthering that interest. 521
U. S., at 515-516.

In holding that RFRA could not be justified as "appropriate" enforcement legislation under $ 5, the Court emphasized that Congress' enforcement power is "remedial"
in nature. Id., at 519. We recognized that "[l]egislation
which deters or remedies constitutional violations can fall
within the sweep of Congress' enforcement power even if in
the process it prohibits conduct which is not itself unconstitutional and intrudes into `legislative spheres of autonomy

previously reserved to the States.' " Id., at 518 (citation
omitted). We also noted, however, that " `[a]s broad as the
congressional enforcement power is, it is not unlimited,' "
ibid., and held that "Congress does not enforce a constitutional right by changing what the right is. It has been
given the power `to enforce,' not the power to determine
what constitutes a constitutional violation," id., at 519.

Opinion of the Court
case law examining the propriety of Congress' various votingrights measures,

5 the Court explained:

"While the line between measures that remedy or pre-vent unconstitutional actions and measures that make a

substantive change in the governing law is not easy todiscern, and Congress must have wide latitude in determining where it lies, the distinction exists and must beobserved. There must be a congruence and proportionality between the injury to be prevented or remediedand the means adopted to that end. Lacking such a
connection, legislation may become substantive in opera-tion and effect."

Id., at 519-520.

We thus held that for Congress to invoke $ 5, it must identifyconduct transgressing the Fourteenth Amendment's substantive provisions, and must tailor its legislative scheme toremedying or preventing such conduct.

RFRA failed to meet this test because there was littlesupport in the record for the concerns that supposedly
animated the law. Id., at 530-531. And, unlike the meas-ures in the voting rights cases, RFRA's provisions were
"so out of proportion to a supposed remedial or preventiveobject" that RFRA could not be understood "as responsive
to, or designed to prevent, unconstitutional behavior."Id., at 532; see also id., at 534 ("Simply put, RFRA is not
designed to identify and counteract state laws likely to beunconstitutional").

Can the Patent Remedy Act be viewed as remedial or pre-ventive legislation aimed at securing the protections of the
Fourteenth Amendment for patent owners? Following City
of Boerne, we must first identify the Fourteenth Amendment"evil" or "wrong" that Congress intended to remedy, guided

by the principle that the propriety of any $ 5 legislation" `must be judged with reference to the historical experience

. . . it reflects.' " Id., at 525. The underlying conduct atissue here is state infringement of patents and the use of
sovereign immunity to deny patent owners compensation for
the invasion of their patent rights. See H. R. Rep., at 37-38 ("[P]atent owners are effectively denied a remedy for

damages resulting from infringement by a State or Stateentity"); S. Rep., at 6 ("[P]laintiffs in patent infringement
cases against a State are foreclosed from damages, regard-less of the State conduct"). It is this conduct then--unremedied patent infringement by the States--that must give rise
to the Fourteenth Amendment violation that Congress
sought to redress in the Patent Remedy Act.

In enacting the Patent Remedy Act, however, Congress
identified no pattern of patent infringement by the States,
let alone a pattern of constitutional violations. Unlike the
undisputed record of racial discrimination confronting Congress in the voting rights cases, see City of Boerne, supra, at
525-527, Congress came up with little evidence of infringing
conduct on the part of the States. The House Report acknowledged that "many states comply with patent law" and
could provide only two examples of patent infringement suits
against the States. See H. R. Rep., at 38. The Federal Circuit in its opinion identified only eight patent-infringement
suits prosecuted against the States in the 110 years between
1880 and 1990. See 148 F. 3d, at 1353-1354.

Testimony before the House Subcommittee in favor of the
bill acknowledged that "states are willing and able to respect patent rights. The fact that there are so few reported
cases involving patent infringement claims against states
underlies the point." Patent Remedy Clarification Act:

("[S]tates do occasionally find themselves in patent infringement suits"). Even the bill's sponsor conceded that "[w]e do
not have any evidence of massive or widespread violation of
patent laws by the States either with or without this State
immunity." Id., at 22 (statement of Rep. Kastenmeier).6
The Senate Report, as well, contains no evidence that unremedied patent infringement by States had become a problem
of national import. At most, Congress heard testimony that
patent infringement by States might increase in the future,
see House Hearings 22 (statement of Jeffrey Samuels); id.,
at 36-37 (statement of Robert Merges); id., at 57 (statement
of William Thompson), and acted to head off this speculative
harm. See H. R. Rep., at 38.

College Savings argues that by infringing a patent and
then pleading immunity to an infringement suit, a State not
only infringes the patent, but deprives the patentee of property without due process of law and "takes" the property

in the patent without paying the just compensation required

6 Representative Kastenmeier made this statement in the course of
questioning Jeffrey M. Samuels, Acting Commissioner of Patents and
Trademarks, U. S. Department of Commerce. The discussion continued:

"Mr. Kastenmeier. . . .
"Accordingly, could one argue that this legislation may be premature.
We really do not know whether it will have any affect [sic] or not.

"Mr. Samuels. Well, you are right, Mr. Chairman. There have not
been many cases that have raised this issue. I guess our feeling is that
it is a step that should be taken now because the possibility exists in light
of Atascadero and in light of the Chew case that more States will get
involved in infringing patents.

"I guess as a general policy statement, we believe that those engaged--
those who do engage in patent infringement should be subject to all the
remedies that are set forth in the Patent Act and that the rights of a
patent owner should not be dependent upon the identity of the entity who
is infringing, whether it be a private individual, or corporation, or State.

"So just as a general philosophical matter, we believe that this law needs
to be passed."

Opinion of the Court

by the Fifth Amendment.7 The United States declines to
defend the Act as based on the Just Compensation Clause,
but joins in College Savings' defense of the Act as designed
to prevent a State from depriving a patentee of property
without due process of law. Florida Prepaid contends that
Congress may not invoke $ 5 to protect property interests
that it has created in the first place under Article I. Patents, however, have long been considered a species of
property. See Brown v. Duchesne, 19 How. 183, 197 (1857)
("For, by the laws of the United States, the rights of a party
under a patent are his private property"); cf., Consolidated
Fruit-Jar Co. v. Wright, 94 U. S. 92, 96 (1877) ("A patent for
an invention is as much property as a patent for land"). As
such, they are surely included within the "property" of which
no person may be deprived by a State without due process
of law. And if the Due Process Clause protects patents, we
know of no reason why Congress might not legislate against
their deprivation without due process under $ 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.

Though patents may be considered "property" for purposes of our analysis, the legislative record still provides
little support for the proposition that Congress sought to
remedy a Fourteenth Amendment violation in enacting the
Patent Remedy Act. The Due Process Clause provides,
"nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or
property, without due process of law." U. S. Const., Amdt.
14, $ 1 (emphasis added). This Court has accordingly held
that "[i]n procedural due process claims, the deprivation by

7 There is no suggestion in the language of the statute itself, or in the
House or Senate Reports of the bill which became the statute, that Congress had in mind the Just Compensation Clause of the Fifth Amendment.
Since Congress was so explicit about invoking its authority under Article
I and its authority to prevent a State from depriving a person of property
without due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment, we think
this omission precludes consideration of the Just Compensation Clause as
a basis for the Patent Remedy Act.

Opinion of the Court
state action of a constitutionally protected interest . . . isnot in itself unconstitutional; what is unconstitutional is the

deprivation of such an interest without due process of law."Zinermon v. Burch, 494 U. S. 113, 125 (1990) (emphasis
deleted).Thus, under the plain terms of the Clause and the clear
import of our precedent, a State's infringement of a patent,though interfering with a patent owner's right to exclude
others, does not by itself violate the Constitution. Instead,only where the State provides no remedy, or only inadequate
remedies, to injured patent owners for its infringement oftheir patent could a deprivation of property without due
process result. See Parratt v. Taylor, 451 U. S. 527, 539-541 (1981); Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U. S. 517, 532-533 (1984);
id., at 539 (O'Connor, J., concurring) ("[I]n challenging aproperty deprivation, the claimant must either avail himself
of the remedies guaranteed by state law or prove that theavailable remedies are inadequate . . . . When adequate
remedies are provided and followed, no . . . deprivation ofproperty without due process can result").

Congress, however, barely considered the availability ofstate remedies for patent infringement and hence whether
the States' conduct might have amounted to a constitutionalviolation under the Fourteenth Amendment. It did hear a
limited amount of testimony to the effect that the remediesavailable in some States were uncertain.

a patentee . . . would apparently have to draft her cause of action as
a general tort claim--or perhaps one for restitution--to come within the
statute. This might be impossible, or at least difficult under California
law"); id., at 43 ("[I]t is true that you may have State remedies, alternative
State remedies. . . . You could bring a deceit suit. You could try just a
general unfair competition suit. A restitution is one that has occurred to
me as a possible basis of recovery"); id., at 34 ("Another problem with this
approach is that it assumes that such state law remedies will be available
in every state in which the patentee's product is sold. This may or may
not be true"); id., at 47 (statement of William Thompson) ("In this case

Opinion of the Court

The primary point made by these witnesses, however, wasnot that state remedies were constitutionally inadequate, but

rather that they were less convenient than federal remedies,and might undermine the uniformity of patent law. See,
e. g., House Hearings 43 (statement of Robert Merges)
("[U]niformity again dictates that that sovereign immunityis a mistake in this field because of the variance among the

State's laws"), id., at 34, 41 (Merges); id., at 58 (statement ofWilliam Thompson).

Congress itself said nothing about the existence or ade-quacy of state remedies in the statute or in the Senate

Report, and made only a few fleeting references to stateremedies in the House Report, essentially repeating the testimony of the witnesses. See H. R. Rep., at 37, n. 158("[T]he availability of a State remedy is tenuous and could
vary significantly State to State"); id., at 38 ("[I]f patentees
turn to the State courts for alternative forms of relief from
patent infringement, the result will be a patchwork of State
laws, actually undermining the goal of national uniformity in

there is no balance, since there are no--or at least there are not very
effective patent remedies at the State level"); id., at 57 ("The court in
Lane [v. First Nat. Bank of Boston, 687 F. Supp. 11 (Mass. 1988),] pointed
out that the appellant may be able to obtain money damages by recourse
to the Massachusetts tort claims act or sue the state for deceit, conversion,
or unfair competition under Massachusetts law. The court also noted a
Massachusetts statute which provides that damages may be recovered
from the state when private property is confiscated for a public purpose.
While many states may have similar statutes, the courts' surmise that
intellectual property infringement cases may be pursued in some state
courts offer us little comfort"); id., at 60 ("[I]t sounds to me like it is a
very difficult area to predict what would happen. There is a rich variety
of potential causes of action, as the prior speaker [Merges] pointed out").

9 It is worth mentioning that the State of Florida provides remedies

to patent owners for alleged infringement on the part of the State.
Aggrieved parties may pursue a legislative remedy through a claims bill
for payment in full, Fla. Stat. $ 11.065 (1997), or a judicial remedy through
a takings or conversion claim, see Jacobs Wind Electric Co. v. Florida
Dept. of Transp., 626 So. 2d 1333 (Fla. 1993).

our patent system"). The need for uniformity in the con-struction of patent law is undoubtedly important, but that is

a factor which belongs to the Article I patent-power calculus,rather than to any determination of whether a state plea of
sovereign immunity deprives a patentee of property without
due process of law.We have also said that a state actor's negligent act that

causes unintended injury to a person's property does not "de-prive" that person of property within the meaning of the Due
Process Clause. See Daniels v. Williams, 474 U. S. 327, 328(1986). Actions predicated on direct patent infringement,
however, do not require any showing of intent to infringe;
instead, knowledge and intent are considered only with respect to damages. See 35 U. S. C. $ 271(a) (1994 ed., Supp.
III); 5 D. Chisum, Patents $ 16.02[2], p. 16-31 (rev. ed. 1998)
(" `It is, of course, elementary, that an infringement may be
entirely inadvertent and unintentional and without knowledge of the patent' "). Congress did not focus on instances
of intentional or reckless infringement on the part of the
States. Indeed, the evidence before Congress suggested
that most state infringement was innocent or at worst negligent. See S. Rep., at 10 (" `It is not always clear that with
all the products that [government] buy[s], that anyone is really aware of the patent status of any particular invention or
device or product' "); H. R. Rep., at 39 ("[I]t should be very
rare for a court to find . . . willful infringement on the part
of a State or State agency"). Such negligent conduct, however, does not violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

The legislative record thus suggests that the Patent Remedy Act does not respond to a history of "widespread and
persisting deprivation of constitutional rights" of the sort
Congress has faced in enacting proper prophylactic $ 5 legislation. City of Boerne, 521 U. S., at 526. Instead, Congress
appears to have enacted this legislation in response to a
handful of instances of state patent infringement that do not

Opinion of the Court

necessarily violate the Constitution. Though the lack of
support in the legislative record is not determinative, see id.,
at 531, identifying the targeted constitutional wrong or evil
is still a critical part of our $ 5 calculus because "[s]trong
measures appropriate to address one harm may be an unwarranted response to another, lesser one," id., at 530. Here,
the record at best offers scant support for Congress' conclusion that States were depriving patent owners of property
without due process of law by pleading sovereign immunity
in federal-court patent actions.

Because of this lack, the provisions of the Patent Remedy
Act are "so out of proportion to a supposed remedial or preventive object that [they] cannot be understood as responsive to, or designed to prevent, unconstitutional behavior."
Id., at 532. An unlimited range of state conduct would
expose a State to claims of direct, induced, or contributory
patent infringement, and the House Report itself cited testimony acknowledging " `it[']s difficult for us to identify
a patented product or process which might not be used by a
state.' " H. R. Rep., at 38.10 Despite subjecting States to
this expansive liability, Congress did nothing to limit the
coverage of the Act to cases involving arguable constitutional violations, such as where a State refuses to offer any

10 The relevant testimony stated in full:
"The comments regarding copyright centered on substantial use of copyrighted textbooks by state universities as well as state use of copyrighted
music and computer software. State use of patented products is more
diverse and more substantial. Patented inventions are involved in all
manner of commonly used machines, tools, instruments, chemicals, compounds, materials, and devices of all description and purpose. Furthermore, patented processes are commonplace. States and state instrumentalities own and operate hospitals, universities, prisons, and libraries.
States build and maintain roads. States provide facilities and equipment
for large numbers of employees who perform all manner of state supported
activities. It[']s difficult for us to identify a patented product or process
which might not be used by a state." House Hearings 55 (statement of
William Thompson).

Opinion of the Court
state-court remedy for patent owners whose patents it had
infringed. Nor did it make any attempt to confine the reach
of the Act by limiting the remedy to certain types of infringement, such as nonnegligent infringement or infringement authorized pursuant to state policy; or providing for
suits only against States with questionable remedies or a
high incidence of infringement.

Instead, Congress made all States immediately amenable
to suit in federal court for all kinds of possible patent infringement and for an indefinite duration. Our opinion in
City of Boerne discussed with approval the various limits
that Congress imposed in its voting rights measures, see
521 U. S., at 532-533, and noted that where "a congressional
enactment pervasively prohibits constitutional state action
in an effort to remedy or to prevent unconstitutional state
action, limitations of this kind tend to ensure Congress'
means are proportionate to ends legitimate under $ 5," id.,
at 533. The Patent Remedy Act's indiscriminate scope offends this principle, and is particularly incongruous in light
of the scant support for the predicate unconstitutional conduct that Congress intended to remedy. In sum, it simply
cannot be said that "many of [the acts of infringement]
affected by the congressional enactment have a significant
likelihood of being unconstitutional." Id., at 532.

The historical record and the scope of coverage therefore
make it clear that the Patent Remedy Act cannot be sustained under $ 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. The examples of States avoiding liability for patent infringement by
pleading sovereign immunity in a federal-court patent action
are scarce enough, but any plausible argument that such action on the part of the State deprived patentees of property
and left them without a remedy under state law is scarcer
still. The statute's apparent and more basic aims were to
provide a uniform remedy for patent infringement and to
place States on the same footing as private parties under

that regime.11 These are proper Article I concerns, but thatArticle does not give Congress the power to enact such legislation after Seminole Tribe.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and
the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with thisopinion.

It is so ordered.
Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Souter, Justice
Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer join, dissenting.

The Constitution vests Congress with plenary author-ity over patents and copyrights. U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 8,

cl. 8. Nearly 200 years ago, Congress provided for exclusivejurisdiction of patent infringement litigation in the federal
courts.1 See Campbell v. Haverhill, 155 U. S. 610, 620

11 See 35 U. S. C. $ 271(h) (stating that States and state entities "shall be
subject to the provisions of this title in the same manner and to the same
extent as any nongovernmental entity"); see also H. R. Rep., at 40 ("The
Committee believes that the full panoply of remedies provided in the patent law should be available to patentees whose legitimate rights have been
infringed by States or State entities"); S. Rep., at 14. Thus, contrary to
the dissent's intimation, see post, at 663 (opinion of Stevens, J.), the Patent Remedy Act does not put States in the same position as the United
States. Under the Patent Remedy Act, States are subject to all the remedies available to plaintiffs in infringement actions, which include punitive
damages and attorney's fees, see 35 U. S. C. $$ 284, 285, as well as injunctive relief, see $ 283. In waiving its own immunity from patent infringement actions in 28 U. S. C. $ 1498(a) (1994 ed. and Supp. III), however, the
United States did not consent to either treble damages or injunctive relief,
and allowed reasonable attorney's fees only in a narrow class of specified
instances.

1 See Act of Apr. 17, 1800, ch. 25, 2 Stat. 37; Act of Feb. 19, 1819, ch. 19,

(1895). In 1992 Congress clarified that jurisdictional grantby an amendment to the patent law that unambiguously authorizes patent infringement actions against States, stateinstrumentalities, and any officer or employee of a State acting in his official capacity. Pub. L. 102-560, 106 Stat. 4230,35 U. S. C. $ 271(h). Given the absence of effective state
remedies for patent infringement by States and the statu-tory pre-emption of such state remedies, the 1992 Patent and
Plant Variety Protection Remedy Clarification Act (PatentRemedy Act) was an appropriate exercise of Congress'
power under $ 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to preventstate deprivations of property without due process of law.

This Court's recent decision in City of Boerne v. Flores,521 U. S. 507 (1997), amply supports congressional authority
to enact the Patent Remedy Act, whether one assumes thatStates seldom infringe patents, see ante, at 640-641, 645-
646, or that patent infringements potentially permeate an"unlimited range of state conduct," see ante, at 646. Before
discussing City of Boerne, however, I shall comment brieflyon the principle that undergirds all aspects of our patent
system: national uniformity.

I
In his commentaries on the Federal Constitution, JusticeStory said of the Patent and Copyright Clauses:

"It is beneficial to all parties, that the national govern-ment should possess this power; to authors and invenrisdiction shall be exclusive of the courts of the states in patent, plant
variety protection and copyright cases." The second sentence of $ 1338(a)
(excluding the reference to plant variety protection cases) has been
worded in essentially the same way since 1878. See Rev. Stat. $ 711
(1878). This Court has used various criteria for determining when an
action "arises under" the patent law, see, e. g., Dale Tile Mfg. Co. v. Hyatt,
125 U. S. 46, 52-53 (1888), but it is well established that a patent infringement claim is "the paradigm of an action `arising under' the patent laws."

Sound reasons support both Congress' authority over pat-ents and its subsequent decision in 1800 to vest exclusive
jurisdiction over patent infringement litigation in the federalcourts. The substantive rules of law that are applied in patent infringement cases are entirely federal. From the be-ginning, Congress has given the patentee the right to bring
an action for patent infringement. $ 4, 1 Stat. 111. Thereis, accordingly, a strong federal interest in an interpretation
of the patent statutes that is both uniform and faithful to theconstitutional goals of stimulating invention and rewarding
the disclosure of novel and useful advances in technology.See

Graham v. John Deere Co. of Kansas City, 383U. S. 1, 9 (1966). Federal interests are threatened, not only

by inadequate protection for patentees, but also when over-protection may have an adverse impact on a competitive
economy. See Bonito Boats, Inc. v. Thunder Craft Boats,
Inc., 489 U. S. 141, 162-163 (1989). Therefore, consistency,uniformity, and familiarity with the extensive and relevant

body of patent jurisprudence are matters of overriding sig-nificance in this area of the law.

Patent infringement litigation often raises difficult techni-cal issues that are unfamiliar to the average trial judge.

2

That consideration, as well as the divergence among the fed-eral circuits in their interpretation of patent issues, provided

support for the congressional decision in 1982 to consolidateappellate jurisdiction of patent appeals in the Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit.3 Although that court hasjurisdiction over all appeals from federal trial courts in patent infringement cases, it has no power to review state-courtdecisions on questions of patent law. See 28 U. S. C. $ 1295.

2 The Advisory Commission on Patent Law Reform recommended in
1992 that patent jurisdiction be restricted to a single district court
per circuit and that district courts designate and use judges with special
expertise in patent litigation. "With this increased expertise, courts
would be able to more effectively control litigation proceedings, and
ensure consistency in the application of substantive patent law . . . .
Of course, the restricted jurisdictional provision would reduce the flexibility currently available to parties to file actions pursuant to the general
jurisdictional authority. Yet patent practice is an essentially national
practice in the United States. The `costs' in terms of lost flexibility associated with this change would appear to be relatively minor in comparison
to the prospective benefits in uniformity of practice." Advisory Commission on Patent Law Reform, D. Comer et al., Report to the Secretary of
Commerce 99 (Aug. 1992).

3 In its Report on the Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1982, the

House stated, "Patent litigation long has been identified as a problem area,
characterized by undue forum-shopping and unsettling inconsistency in
adjudications. Based on the evidence it compiled during the course of
thorough hearings on the subject, the Commission on Revision of the Federal Court Appellate System--created by Act of Congress--concluded
that patent law is an area in which the application of the law to the facts
of a case often produces different outcomes in different courtrooms in substantially similar cases. As a result, some circuit courts are regarded as
`pro-patent' and other `anti-patent,' and much time and money is expended
in `shopping' for a favorable venue. In a Commission survey of practitioners, the patent bar reported that uncertainty created by the lack of
national law precedent was a significant problem; the Commission found
patent law to be an area in which widespread forum-shopping was particularly acute." H. R. Rep. No. 97-312, pp. 20-21 (1981) (footnotes omitted);
see also S. Rep. No. 97-275, p. 5 (1981).

BD. v. COLLEGE SAVINGS BANK

Stevens, J., dissenting

The reasons that motivated the creation of the FederalCircuit would be undermined by any exception that allowed

patent infringement claims to be brought in state court.Today the Court first acknowledges that the "need for uniformity in the construction of patent law is undoubtedly im-portant,"

ante, at 645, but then discounts its significance asmerely "a factor which belongs to the Article I patent-power

calculus, rather than to any determination of whether a stateplea of sovereign immunity deprives a patentee of property
without due process of law." Ibid. But the "Article Ipatent-power calculus" is directly relevant to this case because it establishes the constitutionality of the congressionaldecision to vest exclusive jurisdiction over patent infringement cases in the federal courts. That basic decision wasunquestionably appropriate. It was equally appropriate
for Congress to abrogate state sovereign immunity in patentinfringement cases in order to close a potential loophole in
the uniform federal scheme, which, if undermined, wouldnecessarily decrease the efficacy of the process afforded to
patent holders. II

Our recent decision in City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U. S.507 (1997), sets out the general test for determining whether
Congress has enacted "appropriate" legislation pursuant to$ 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. "There must be a congruence and proportionality between the injury to be pre-vented or remedied and the means adopted to that end."
Id., at 520. The first step of the inquiry, then, is to deter-mine what injury Congress sought to prevent or remedy
with the relevant legislation.

As the Court recognizes, Congress' authority under $ 5 ofthe Fourteenth Amendment extends to enforcing the Due

Process Clause of that Amendment. Ante, at 637. Con-gress decided, and I agree, that the Patent Remedy Act was
a proper exercise of this power.

The Court acknowledges, as it must, that patents are property. Ante, at 642; see also Consolidated Fruit-Jar Co. v.
Wright, 94 U. S. 92, 96 (1877). Every valid patent "gives the
patentee or his assignee the `exclusive right to make, use,
and vend the invention or discovery' for a limited period."
Transparent-Wrap Machine Corp. v. Stokes & Smith Co., 329
U. S. 637, 643 (1947). The Court suggests, however, that a
State's infringement of a patent does not necessarily constitute a "deprivation" within the meaning of the Due Process
Clause, because the infringement may be done negligently.
Ante, at 645.

As part of its attempt to stem the tide of prisoner litigation, and to avoid making "the Fourteenth Amendment

a font of tort law to be superimposed upon whatever systems may already be administered by the States," Daniels
v. Williams, 474 U. S. 327, 332-334 (1986), this Court has
drawn a constitutional distinction between negligent and intentional misconduct. Injuries caused by the mere negligence of state prison officials--in leaving a pillow on the
stairs of the jail, for example--do not "deprive" anyone of
liberty or property within the meaning of the Due Process
Clause of that Amendment. Ibid. On the other hand, willful misconduct, and perhaps "recklessness or gross negligence," may give rise to such a deprivation. Id., at 334.

While I disagree with the Court's assumption that this
standard necessarily applies to deprivations of patent rights,
the Daniels line of cases has only marginal relevance to this
case: Respondent College Savings Bank has alleged that
petitioner's infringement was willful.4 The question presented by this case, then, is whether the Patent Remedy Act,

4 Paragraph 7 of College Savings' complaint alleges that " `[d]efendant
Florida Prepaid with actual knowledge of the '055 patent, with knowledge
of its infringement, and without lawful justification, has willfully infringed
the '055 patent.' " App. to Pet. for Cert. 30a.

which clarified Congress' intent to subject state infringers to
suit in federal court, may be applied to willful infringement.5

As I read the Court's opinion, its negative answer to that
question has nothing to do with the facts of this case. Instead, it relies entirely on perceived deficiencies in the
evidence reviewed by Congress before it enacted the clarifying amendment. "In enacting the Patent Remedy Act . . .
Congress identified no pattern of patent infringement by
the States, let alone a pattern of constitutional violations."
Ante, at 640.

It is quite unfair for the Court to strike down Congress'
Act based on an absence of findings supporting a requirement this Court had not yet articulated. The legislative
history of the Patent Remedy Act makes it abundantly clear
that Congress was attempting to hurdle the then-mostrecent barrier this Court had erected in the Eleventh
Amendment course--the "clear statement" rule of Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S. 234 (1985).6

5 As a practical matter, infringement actions based on mere negligence
rarely arise. Most patent infringers are put on notice that their conduct
may be actionable before an infringement suit is filed. "The first step in
enforcing a patent is usually to send a cease-and-desist or charge-ofinfringement letter." Pokotilow & Siegal, Cease and Desist Letters: The
Legal Pitfalls for Patentees, 4 Intellectual Property Strategist, No. 3,
p. 1 (1997).

6 The Chairman of the House Subcommittee considering the Patent

Remedy Act, Representative Kastenmeier, engaged in the following dialogue with William Thompson, President of the American Intellectual
Property Law Association, about whether States were definitively immune from suit under the Eleventh Amendment following the Federal
Circuit's recent decision in Chew v. California, 893 F. 2d 331 (1990):

"Mr. Kastenmeier. You mentioned that you do not see the likelihood
of further cases in this area since the Atascadero and Chew cases seem to
be fairly definitive on this question, unless there were in fact remedial
legislation. Do you anticipate that remedial legislation, such as the bill
before us, if passed into law, would be the subject of litigation?

"Mr. Thompson. No, I think it would be very clear. Your legislation
is very clearly drawn. It seems to match the tests set forth in Atascadero

Nevertheless, Congress did hear testimony about inade-quate state remedies for patent infringement when considering the Patent Remedy Act. The leading case referred toin the congressional hearing was

Chew v. California, 893
F. 2d 331 (CA Fed. 1990). In fact, Chew prompted Congress
to consider the legislation that became the Patent Rem-edy Act. See H. R. Rep. No. 101-960, pt. 1, p. 7, and

n. 20 (1990). The Federal Circuit held in that case thatcongressional intent to abrogate state sovereign immunity
under the patent laws was not "unmistakably clear," as thisCourt had required in

Atascadero. Chew, 893 F. 2d, at 334.
The facts of Chew clearly support both Congress' decisionand authority to enact the Patent Remedy Act. Marian

Chew had invented a method for testing automobile engine
exhaust emissions and secured a patent on her discovery.Her invention was primarily used by States and other governmental entities. In 1987, Chew, an Ohio resident, sued
the State of California in federal court for infringing her
patent. California filed a motion to dismiss on Eleventh
Amendment grounds, which the District Court granted.
The Federal Circuit affirmed, id., at 332, expressly stating
that the question whether Chew had a remedy under California law "is a question not before us." Nevertheless, it
implied that its decision would have been the same even
if Chew were left without any remedy. Id., at 336. During
its hearing on the Patent Remedy Act, Congress heard testimony about the Chew case. Professor Merges stated that
Chew might not have been able to draft her infringement
suit as a tort claim. "This might be impossible, o[r] at least

of making it very clear that the patent statute is one that would qualify
as an abrogation area [sic] in the 11th amendment.

"I can never guarantee exactly how attorneys are going to read statutes,
Mr. Chairman, but all of the sane ones would not bring an action." Hearing before the Subcommittee on Courts, Intellectual Property, and the

difficult, under California law. Consequently, relief under[state statutes] may be not be a true alternative avenue of

recovery." House Hearing 33.7Congress heard other general testimony that state remedies would likely be insufficient to compensate inventorswhose patents had been infringed. The Acting Commissioner of Patents stated: "If States and their instrumental-ities were immune from suit in federal court for patent
infringement, patent holders would be forced to pursue un-certain, perhaps even non-existent, remedies under State
law." Id., at 15. The legislative record references severalcases of patent infringement involving States. See

Paperless Accounting, Inc. v. Mass Transit Administration, CivilNo. HAR 84-2922 (D. Md. 1985) (cited in House Hearing

56); Hercules, Inc. v. Minnesota State Highway Dept.,337 F. Supp. 795 (Minn. 1972) (House Hearing 51); Lemelson v. Ampex Corp., 372 F. Supp. 708 (ND Ill. 1974) (same).In addition, Congress found that state infringement of
patents was likely to increase. H. R. Rep. No. 101-960,pt. 1, at 38. The Court's opinion today dismisses this rationale: "At most, Congress heard testimony that patent in-fringement by States might increase in the future and acted
to head off this speculative harm." Ante, at 641 (citationsomitted). In fact, States and their instrumentalities, especially state universities, have been involved in many patentcases since 1992. See

7 Merges continued: "Another problem with this approach is that it assumes that such state law remedies will be available in every state in
which the patentee's product is sold. This may or may not be true. In
any event, requiring a potential plaintiff (patentee) to ascertain the validity of her claims under the differing substantive and procedural laws of
the fifty states may well prove a very substantial disincentive to the commencement of such suits. Moreover, it would vitiate a major goal of the
federal intellectual property system: national uniformity. In short, these
remedies are simply no substitute for patent infringement actions." Id.,

Furthermore, States and their instrumentalities are heavily involved in the federal patent system.8 The United

patents to universities (both public and private) in 1986
alone. Chakansky, Patent Profiles, 13 Computer Law Strategist, No. 9, p. 8 (1997). Royalty earnings from licenses at

See ante, at 643. But, it is particularly ironic that the Court
should view this fact as support for its holding. Given that
Congress had long ago pre-empted state jurisdiction over
patent infringement cases, it was surely reasonable for Congress to assume that such remedies simply did not exist.10
Furthermore, it is well known that not all States have

9 To the extent that a majority of this Court finds this factor dispositive,
there is hope that the Copyright Remedy Clarification Act of 1990 may be
considered "appropriate" $ 5 legislation. The legislative history of that
Act includes many examples of copyright infringements by States--especially state universities. See Hearings on H. R. 1131 before the Subcommittee on Courts, Intellectual Property, and the Administration of Justice
of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 101st Cong., 1st Sess., 93, 148
(1989); Hearing on S. 497 before the Subcommittee on Patents, Copyrights,
and Trademarks of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 101st Cong.,
1st Sess., 148 (1989). Perhaps most importantly, the House requested that
the Register of Copyrights prepare a study, which he described in his
transmittal letter as, "a factual inquiry about enforcement of copyright
against state governments and about unfair copyright licensing practices,
if any, with respect to state government use of copyrighted works. I
have also prepared an in-depth analysis of the current state of Eleventh
Amendment law and the decisions relating to copyright liability of states,
including an assessment of any constitutional limitations on Congressional
action. Finally, as you requested, the American Law Division of the Congressional Research Service has conducted a 50 state survey of the statutes and case law concerning waiver of state sovereign immunity." Register of Copyrights, R. Oman, Copyright Liability of States and the

12, 14, 93-95.

10 After the 1992 Act was passed, the Florida Supreme Court did hold

that a patentee might bring some sort of "takings" claim in a state court,
or might seek a legislative remedy. See Jacobs Wind Electric Co. v. Florida Dept. of Transp., 626 So. 2d 1333 (1993). Given the unambiguous text
of 28 U. S. C. $ 1338, there is (a) no reason why Congress could have anticipated that decision, and (b) good reason to believe a well-motivated court
may have misinterpreted federal law. See Jacobs Wind, 626 So. 2d, at
1337-1338 (Harding, J., dissenting).

waived their sovereign immunity from suit,11 and among
those States that have, the contours of this waiver vary
widely.12

Even if such remedies might be available in theory, it
would have been "appropriate" for Congress to conclude that
they would not guarantee patentees due process in infringement actions against state defendants. State judges have
never had the exposure to patent litigation that federal
judges have experienced for decades, and, unlike infringement actions brought in federal district courts, their decisions would not be reviewable in the Court of Appeals for
the Federal Circuit. Surely this Court would not undertake
the task of reviewing every state-court decision that arguably misapplied patent law.13 And even if 28 U. S. C. $ 1338
is amended or construed to permit state courts to entertain
infringement actions when a State is named as a defendant,
given the Court's opinion in Alden v. Maine, it is by no
means clear that state courts could be required to hear these
cases at all. Post, at 712.

BD. v. COLLEGE SAVINGS BANK

Stevens, J., dissenting

Even if state courts elected to hear patent infringementcases against state entities, the entire category of such cases

would raise questions of impartiality. This concern under-lies both the constitutional authorization of diversity jurisdiction and the statutory provisions for removal of certaincases from state to federal courts, 28 U. S. C. $ 1441

et seq.The same concern justified John Marshall's narrow construction of the Eleventh Amendment in Cohens v. Virginia, 6Wheat. 264 (1821). As he there noted, when there is a conflict between a State's interest and a federal right, it "wouldbe hazarding too much to assert, that the judicatures of the
States will be exempt from the prejudices by which the leg-islatures and people are influenced, and will constitute perfectly impartial tribunals." Id., at 386.Finally, this Court has never mandated that Congress
must find " `widespread and persisting deprivation of con-stitutional rights,' "

ante, at 645, in order to employ its $ 5authority. It is not surprising, therefore, that Congress did

not compile an extensive legislative record analyzing the dueprocess (or lack thereof) that each State might afford for a
patent infringement suit retooled as an action in tort. In1992, Congress had no reason to believe it needed to do such
a thing; indeed, it should not have to do so today.

III
In my view, Congress had sufficient evidence of due proc-ess violations, whether actual or potential, to meet the requirement we expressed in City of Boerne that Congress canact under $ 5 only to "remedy or prevent unconstitutional
actions." See 521 U. S., at 519. The Court's opinion todaythreatens to read Congress' power to pass prophylactic legislation out of $ 5 altogether; its holding is unsupported by City
of Boerne and in fact conflicts with our reasoning in thatcase.

In City of Boerne we affirmed the well-settled principlethat the broad sweep of Congress' enforcement power en527US2 Unit: $U89 [05-09-01 13:05:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Stevens, J., dissenting
compasses legislation that deters or remedies constitutionalviolations, even if it prohibits conduct that is not itself unconstitutional, and even if it intrudes into spheres of autonomypreviously reserved to the States.

Id., at 518. Nevertheless, we held that the enactment of the Religious Freedom
Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA) was not an "appropriate"exercise of Congress' enforcement power under $ 5 of the

Fourteenth Amendment. Id., at 536.By enacting RFRA Congress sought to change the meaning of the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment asit had been interpreted by this Court, rather than to remedy
or to prevent violations of the Clause as we had interpreted
it. We held that RFRA had crossed "the line between
measures that remedy or prevent unconstitutional actions
and measures that make a substantive change in the governing law." Id., at 519-520. Congress' $ 5 power is "corrective or preventive, not definitional." Id., at 525. Our
extensive review of the legislative history of RFRA made
it clear that the statute could not be fairly characterized
as a remedial measure, but rather was a legislative attempt
"to interpret and elaborate on the meaning" of the Free
Exercise Clause. By doing so, Congress had violated the
principle that the "power to interpret the Constitution in
a case or controversy remains in the Judiciary." Id., at
524.

The difference between the harm targeted by RFRA and
the harm that motivated the enactment of the Patent Remedy Act is striking. In RFRA Congress sought to overrule
this Court's interpretation of the First Amendment. The
Patent Remedy Act, however, was passed to prevent future
violations of due process, based on the substantiated fear
that States would be unable or unwilling to provide adequate
remedies for their own violations of patent holders' rights.
Congress' "wide latitude" in determining remedial or preventive measures, see id., at 520, has suddenly become very
narrow indeed.

City of Boerne also identified a "proportionality" com-ponent to "appropriate" legislation under $ 5. Our opinion

expressly recognized that "preventive rules are sometimesappropriate" if there is

"a congruence between the means used and the ends tobe achieved. The appropriateness of remedial measures must be considered in light of the evil presented.See

South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U. S., at 308.
Strong measures appropriate to address one harm maybe an unwarranted response to another, lesser one.

Id.,
at 334." Id., at 530.

In RFRA we found no such congruence, both because of the
absence of evidence of widespread violations that were inneed of redress, and because the sweeping coverage of the

statute ensured "its intrusion at every level of government,
displacing laws and prohibiting official actions of almostevery description and regardless of subject matter."

Id.,
at 532.Again, the contrast between RFRA and the Act at issue

in this case could not be more stark. The sole purpose ofthis amendment is to abrogate the States' sovereign immunity as a defense to a charge of patent infringement. It hasno impact whatsoever on any substantive rule of state law,
but merely effectuates settled federal policy to confine patent
infringement litigation to federal judges. There is precisecongruence between "the means used" (abrogation of sovereign immunity in this narrow category of cases) and "theends to be achieved" (elimination of the risk that the defense
of sovereign immunity will deprive some patentees of property without due process of law).

That congruence is equally precise whether infringement
of patents by state actors is rare or frequent. If they
are indeed unusual, the statute will operate only in those
rare cases. But if such infringements are common, or
should become common as state activities in the commercial

arena increase, the impact of the statute will likewise ex-pand in precise harmony with the growth of the problem that

Congress anticipated and sought to prevent. In either eventthe statute will have no impact on the States' enforcement
of their own laws. None of the concerns that underlay ourdecision in

City of Boerne are even remotely implicated inthis case.

The Patent Remedy Act merely puts States in the sameposition as all private users of the patent system,

14 and in

virtually the same posture as the United States.15 "When

14 As the Senate said in its Report on the Act, "the current state of
the law leaves the protection afforded to patent and trademark holders
dependant on the status of the infringing party. A public school such as
UCLA can sue a private school such as USC for patent infringement, yet
USC cannot sue UCLA for the same act." S. Rep. No. 102-280, p. 9
(1992).

15 The majority's assertion that "the Patent Remedy Act does not put

States in the same position as the United States," ante, at 648, n. 11, is
misleading. In the case of private infringement suits, treble damages are

much less mandate treble damages." Ibid. Attorney's fees are available

The remaining differences between the United States' waiver of sovereign immunity and the Patent Remedy Act are supported by quintessentially federal concerns. This Court has found that "the procurement of
equipment by the United States is an area of uniquely federal interest."
Boyle v. United Technologies Corp., 487 U. S. 500, 507 (1988). Indeed, the
importance of the federal interest in military procurement led this Court
to fashion the doctrine of "Government contractors' immunity" without
waiting for Congress to consider the question. Id., at 531 (Stevens, J.,

Congress grants an exclusive right or monopoly, its effectsare pervasive; no citizen or State may escape its reach."

Goldstein v. California, 412 U. S. 546, 560 (1973) (analyzingCopyright Clause). Recognizing the injustice of sovereign
immunity in this context, the United States has waived itsimmunity from suit for patent violations. In 1910, Congress
enacted a statute entitled, "An Act to provide additionalprotection for owners of patents of the United States."
Ch. 423, 36 Stat. 851. The Act provided that owners of pat-ents infringed by the United States "may recover reasonable
compensation for such use by suit in the Court of Claims."The United States has consistently maintained this policy for
the last 90 years. See 28 U. S. C. $ 1498.In my judgment, the 1992 Act is a paradigm of an appropriate exercise of Congress' $ 5 power.16

IV
For these reasons, I am convinced that the 1992 Act shouldbe upheld even if full respect is given to the Court's recent

cases cloaking the States with increasing protection fromcongressional legislation. I do, however, note my continuing
dissent from the Court's aggressive sovereign immunity ju-risprudence; today, this Court once again demonstrates itself
to be the champion of States' rights. In this case, it seeksto guarantee rights the States themselves did not express
any particular desire in possessing: during Congress' hear-ings on the Patent Remedy Act, although invited to do so,

cause of the Federal Government's extensive investment in patented military inventions. "[T]he right to enjoin the officer of the United States . . .
virtually asserts the existence of a judicial power to close every arsenal
of the United States." Crozier v. Krupp A. G., 224 U. S. 290, 302 (1912).

16 I am also persuaded that a State like Florida that has invoked the

benefits of the federal patent system should be deemed to have waived
any defense of sovereign immunity in patent litigation. The reasoning in
Justice Breyer's dissent in College Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid
Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd., post, at 693-699, applies with special
force to this case.

the States chose not to testify in opposition to the abrogationof their immunity.

17

The statute that the Court invalidates today was only oneof several "clear statements" that Congress enacted in response to the decision in Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S. 234 (1985).18 In each of those clarificationsCongress was fully justified in assuming that it had ample

authority to abrogate sovereign immunity defenses to fed-eral claims, an authority that the Court squarely upheld in
Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co., 491 U. S. 1 (1989). It wasthat holding--not just the "plurality opinion," see ante, at
636--that was overruled in Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Flor-ida, 517 U. S. 44 (1996). The full reach of that case's dramatic expansion of the judge-made doctrine of sovereignimmunity is unpredictable; its dimensions are defined only
by the present majority's perception of constitutional penum-bras rather than constitutional text. See

id., at 54 (acknowl-edging " `we have understood the Eleventh Amendment to

stand not so much for what it says' " (citation omitted)).Until this expansive and judicially crafted protection of
States' rights runs its course, I shall continue to register myagreement with the views expressed in the

Seminole dis-sents and in the scholarly commentary on that case.

BOARD et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe third circuit

No. 98-149. Argued April 20, 1999--Decided June 23, 1999
An individual may sue a State where Congress has authorized such a suit

in the exercise of its power to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment, Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U. S. 445, or where a State has waived its sovereign immunity by consenting to suit, Clark v. Barnard, 108 U. S. 436,
447-448. The Trademark Remedy Clarification Act (TRCA) subjects
States to suits brought under $ 43(a) of the Trademark Act of 1946 (Lanham Act) for false and misleading advertising. Petitioner markets and
sells certificates of deposit designed to finance college costs. When
respondent Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Education Expense Board
(Florida Prepaid), a Florida state entity, began its own tuition prepayment program, petitioner filed suit, alleging that Florida Prepaid violated $ 43 by misrepresenting its own program. In granting Florida
Prepaid's motion to dismiss on sovereign immunity grounds, the District
Court rejected arguments made by petitioner and by the United States,
which had intervened, that, under the constructive waiver doctrine of
Parden v. Terminal R. Co. of Ala. Docks Dept., 377 U. S. 184, Florida
Prepaid waived its immunity by engaging in interstate marketing and
administration of its program after the TRCA made clear that such
activity would subject it to suit; and that Congress's abrogation of
sovereign immunity in the TRCA was effective, since it was enacted
to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. The
Third Circuit affirmed.

Held: The federal courts have no jurisdiction to entertain this suit

because Florida's sovereign immunity was neither validly abrogated
by the TRCA nor voluntarily waived. Pp. 672-691.

(a) The TRCA did not abrogate Florida's sovereign immunity. Congress may legislate under $ 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to enforce
the Amendment's other provisions, but the object of such legislation
must be the remediation or prevention of constitutional violations.
Petitioner's argument that Congress enacted the TRCA to remedy and
prevent state deprivations of two property interests without due process is rejected, for neither a right to be free from a business competitor's
false advertising about its own product nor a right to be secure in one's

Syllabus
business interests qualifies as a protected property right. As to the
first: The hallmark of a constitutionally protected property interest is
the right to exclude others. The Lanham Act's false-advertising provisions bear no relationship to any right to exclude; and Florida Prepaid's
alleged misrepresentation concerning its own products intruded upon
no interest over which petitioner had exclusive dominion. As to the
second asserted property interest: While a business's assets are property, and any state taking of those assets is a "deprivation," business in
the sense of the activity of doing business or of making a profit is not
property at all--and it is only that which is impinged upon by a competitor's false advertising about its own product. Pp. 672-675.

(b) Florida's sovereign immunity was not voluntarily waived by its
activities in interstate commerce. Generally, waiver occurs when a
State voluntarily invokes, or clearly declares that it intends to submit
itself to, the jurisdiction of the federal courts. Petitioner and the
United States maintain that an implied or constructive waiver is possible when Congress provides unambiguously that a State will be subject
to private suit if it engages in certain federally regulated conduct and
the State voluntarily elects to engage in that conduct. They rely on
this Court's decision in Parden, supra, which held that the Federal Employers' Liability Act authorized private suit against States operating
railroads by virtue of its general provision permitting suit against common carriers engaged in interstate commerce. This Court has never
applied Parden's holding to another statute, and in fact has narrowed
the case in every subsequent opinion in which it has been under consideration. Even when supplemented by a requirement of unambiguous
statement of congressional intent to subject the States to suit, Parden
cannot be squared with this Court's cases requiring that a State's express waiver of sovereign immunity be unequivocal, see, e. g., Great
Northern Life Ins. Co. v. Read, 322 U. S. 47, and is also inconsistent
with the Court's recent decision in Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida,
517 U. S. 44. Nor is it relevant that the asserted basis for constructive
waiver is conduct by the State that is undertaken for profit, that is
traditionally performed by private entities, and that otherwise resembles the behavior of market participants. Whatever may remain of this
Court's decision in Parden is expressly overruled. Pp. 675-687.

Opinion of the Court
of the Trademark Act of 1946 (Lanham Act) for false andmisleading advertising, 60 Stat. 441, 15 U. S. C. $ 1125(a).

The question presented in this case is whether that provisionis effective to permit suit against a State for its alleged
misrepresentation of its own product--either because theTRCA effects a constitutionally permissible abrogation of
state sovereign immunity, or because the TRCA operates asan invitation to waiver of such immunity which is automatically accepted by a State's engaging in the activities regu-lated by the Lanham Act.

I
In Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 419 (1793), we assertedjurisdiction over an action in assumpsit brought by a South

Carolina citizen against the State of Georgia. In so doing,we reasoned that Georgia's sovereign immunity was qualified
by the general jurisdictional provisions of Article III, and,most specifically, by the provision extending the federal judicial power to controversies "between a State and Citizens ofanother State." U. S. Const., Art. III, $ 2, cl. 1. The "shock
of surprise" created by this decision, Principality of Monacov.

Mississippi, 292 U. S. 313, 325 (1934), prompted the imme-diate adoption of the Eleventh Amendment, which provides:

"The Judicial power of the United States shall not beconstrued to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United Statesby Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects
of any Foreign State."
Though its precise terms bar only federal jurisdiction oversuits brought against one State by citizens of another State

or foreign state, we have long recognized that the EleventhAmendment accomplished much more: It repudiated the
central premise of Chisholm that the jurisdictional heads ofArticle III superseded the sovereign immunity that the
States possessed before entering the Union. This has beenour understanding of the Amendment since the landmark

case of Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U. S. 1 (1890). See also Exparte New York, 256 U. S. 490, 497-498 (1921); Principality

of Monaco, supra, at 320-328, Pennhurst State School andHospital v. Halderman, 465 U. S. 89, 97-98 (1984); Seminole
Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44, 54, 66-68 (1996).While this immunity from suit is not absolute, we have
recognized only two circumstances in which an individualmay sue a State. First, Congress may authorize such a suit
in the exercise of its power to enforce the FourteenthAmendment--an Amendment enacted after the Eleventh
Amendment and specifically designed to alter the federal-state balance.

Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U. S. 445 (1976).Second, a State may waive its sovereign immunity by consenting to suit. Clark v. Barnard, 108 U. S. 436, 447-448(1883). This case turns on whether either of these two circumstances is present. II

Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U. S. C. $ 1125(a),enacted in 1946, created a private right of action against
"[a]ny person" who uses false descriptions or makes falserepresentations in commerce. The TRCA amends $ 43(a) by
defining "any person" to include "any State, instrumentalityof a State or employee of a State or instrumentality of a
State acting in his or her official capacity." $ 3(c), 106 Stat.3568. The TRCA further amends the Lanham Act to provide that such state entities "shall not be immune, under theeleventh amendment of the Constitution of the United States
or under any other doctrine of sovereign immunity, from suitin Federal court by any person, including any governmental
or nongovernmental entity for any violation under this Act,"and that remedies shall be available against such state entities "to the same extent as such remedies are available . . .in a suit against" a nonstate entity. $ 3(b) (codified in 15

Opinion of the Court
it has marketed and sold CollegeSure certificates of deposit
designed to finance the costs of college education. College
Savings holds a patent upon the methodology of administering its CollegeSure certificates. Respondent Florida
Prepaid Postsecondary Education Expense Board (Florida
Prepaid) is an arm of the State of Florida. Since 1988, it
has administered a tuition prepayment program designed to
provide individuals with sufficient funds to cover future college expenses. College Savings brought a patent infringement action against Florida Prepaid in United States
District Court in New Jersey. That action is the subject
of today's decision in Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed.
Expense Bd. v. College Savings Bank, ante, p. 627. In addition, and in the same court, College Savings filed the instant
action alleging that Florida Prepaid violated $ 43(a) of the
Lanham Act by making misstatements about its own tuition
savings plans in its brochures and annual reports.

Florida Prepaid moved to dismiss this action on the
ground that it was barred by sovereign immunity. It argued that Congress had not abrogated sovereign immunity
in this case because the TRCA was enacted pursuant to Congress's powers under Article I of the Constitution and, under
our decisions in Seminole Tribe, supra, and Fitzpatrick,
supra, Congress can abrogate state sovereign immunity only
when it legislates to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment.
The United States intervened to defend the constitutionality
of the TRCA. Both it and College Savings argued that,
under the doctrine of constructive waiver articulated in Parden v. Terminal R. Co. of Ala. Docks Dept., 377 U. S. 184
(1964), Florida Prepaid had waived its immunity from Lanham Act suits by engaging in the interstate marketing and
administration of its program after the TRCA made clear
that such activity would subject Florida Prepaid to suit.
College Savings also argued that Congress's purported abrogation of Florida Prepaid's sovereign immunity in the TRCA

Opinion of the Court

was effective, since it was enacted not merely pursuant toArticle I but also to enforce the Due Process Clause of the

Fourteenth Amendment. The District Court rejected bothof these arguments and granted Florida Prepaid's motion
to dismiss. 948 F. Supp. 400 (N. J. 1996). The Court ofAppeals affirmed. 131 F. 3d 353 (CA3 1997). We granted
certiorari. 525 U. S. 1063 (1999).

III
We turn first to the contention that Florida's sovereignimmunity was validly abrogated. Our decision three Terms

ago in Seminole Tribe, supra, held that the power "to regu-late Commerce" conferred by Article I of the Constitution
gives Congress no authority to abrogate state sovereign im-munity. As authority for the abrogation in the present case,
petitioner relies upon $ 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment,which we held in

Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, supra, and reaffirmedin Seminole Tribe, see 517 U. S., at 72-73, could be used for

that purpose.Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment provides that no
State shall "deprive any person of . . . property . . . withoutdue process of law." Section 5 provides that "[t]he Congress
shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, theprovisions of this article." We made clear in

City of Boernev. Flores, 521 U. S. 507, 516-529 (1997), that the term

"enforce" is to be taken seriously--that the object of valid$ 5 legislation must be the carefully delimited remediation
or prevention of constitutional violations. Petitioner claimsthat, with respect to $ 43(a) of the Lanham Act, Congress
enacted the TRCA to remedy and prevent state deprivationswithout due process of two species of "property" rights: (1)
a right to be free from a business competitor's false advertis-ing about its own product, and (2) a more generalized right
to be secure in one's business interests. Neither of thesequalifies as a property right protected by the Due Process
Clause.

Opinion of the Court
As to the first: The hallmark of a protected property inter-est is the right to exclude others. That is "one of the most

essential sticks in the bundle of rights that are commonlycharacterized as property."

Kaiser Aetna v. United States,
444 U. S. 164, 176 (1979). That is why the right that we all
possess to use the public lands is not the "property" right ofanyone--hence the sardonic maxim, explaining what economists call the "tragedy of the commons," 1 res publica, res
nullius. The Lanham Act may well contain provisions that
protect constitutionally cognizable property interests--nota-bly, its provisions dealing with infringement of trademarks,

which are the "property" of the owner because he can ex-clude others from using them. See,

e. g., K mart Corp. v.
Cartier, Inc., 485 U. S. 176, 185-186 (1988) ("Trademark law,like contract law, confers private rights, which are themselves rights of exclusion. It grants the trademark owner a
bundle of such rights"). The Lanham Act's false-advertising
provisions, however, bear no relationship to any right to exclude; and Florida Prepaid's alleged misrepresentations concerning its own products intruded upon no interest over
which petitioner had exclusive dominion.

Unsurprisingly, petitioner points to no decision of this
Court (or of any other court, for that matter) recognizing a
property right in freedom from a competitor's false advertising about its own products. The closest petitioner comes is
dicta in International News Service v. Associated Press, 248

U. S. 215, 236 (1918), where the Court found equity jurisdiction over an unfair-competition claim because "[t]he rule that
a court of equity concerns itself only in the protection of
property rights treats any civil right of a pecuniary nature
as a property right." But to say that a court of equity
"treats any civil right of a pecuniary nature as a property
right" is not to say that all civil rights of a pecuniary nature
are property rights. In fact, when one reads the full pas1 See Hardin, The Tragedy of the Commons, 162 Science 1243 (1968).

POSTSECONDARY ED. EXPENSE BD.

Opinion of the Court

sage from which this statement is taken it is clear that theCourt was saying just the opposite, namely, that equity will

treat civil rights of a pecuniary nature as property rightseven though they are properly not such:

"In order to sustain the jurisdiction of equity over thecontroversy, we need not affirm any general and absolute property in the news as such. The rule that a courtof equity concerns itself only in the protection of property rights treats any civil right of a pecuniary natureas a property right . . . ; and the right to acquire property by honest labor or the conduct of a lawful business
is as much entitled to protection as the right to guardproperty already acquired. . . . It is this right that furnishes the basis of the jurisdiction in the ordinary caseof unfair competition."

Id., at 236-237.

We may also note that the unfair competition at issue in
International News Service amounted to nothing short of
theft of proprietary information, something in which a powerto "exclude others" could be said to exist. See

id., at 233.
Petitioner argues that the common-law tort of unfair com-petition "by definition" protects property interests, Brief for

Petitioner 15, and thus the TRCA "by definition" is designedto remedy and prevent deprivations of such interests in the
false-advertising context. Even as a logical matter, that
does not follow, since not everything which protects propertyinterests is designed to remedy or prevent

deprivations of
those property interests. A municipal ordinance prohibitingbillboards in residential areas protects the property interests

of homeowners, although erecting billboards would ordinarily not deprive them of property. To sweep within the
Fourteenth Amendment the elusive property interests that
are "by definition" protected by unfair-competition law
would violate our frequent admonition that the Due Process
Clause is not merely a "font of tort law." Paul v. Davis, 424
U. S. 693, 701 (1976).

Opinion of the Court
Petitioner's second assertion of a property interest restsupon an argument similar to the one just discussed, and suffers from the same flaw. Petitioner argues that businessesare "property" within the meaning of the Due Process
Clause, and that Congress legislates under $ 5 when it passesa law that prevents state interference with business (which
false advertising does). Brief for Petitioner 19-20. Theassets of a business (including its good will) unquestionably
are property, and any state taking of those assets is unques-tionably a "deprivation" under the Fourteenth Amendment.
But business in the sense of the activity of doing business,or

the activity of making a profit is not property in the ordi-nary sense--and it is only

that, and not any business asset,which is impinged upon by a competitor's false advertising.

Finding that there is no deprivation of property at issuehere, we need not pursue the follow-on question that City of
Boerne would otherwise require us to resolve: whether theprophylactic measure taken under purported authority of $ 5
(viz., prohibition of States' sovereign-immunity claims, whichare not in themselves violations of the Fourteenth Amendment) was genuinely necessary to prevent violation of theFourteenth Amendment. We turn next to the question
whether Florida's sovereign immunity, though not abro-gated, was voluntarily waived.

IV
We have long recognized that a State's sovereign immu-nity is "a personal privilege which it may waive at pleasure."

Clark v. Barnard, 108 U. S., at 447. The decision to waivethat immunity, however, "is altogether voluntary on the part
of the sovereignty." Beers v. Arkansas, 20 How. 527, 529(1858). Accordingly, our "test for determining whether a
State has waived its immunity from federal-court jurisdic-tion is a stringent one." Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S. 234, 241 (1985). Generally, we will find awaiver either if the State voluntarily invokes our jurisdic527US2 Unit: $U90 [05-09-01 13:06:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN

tion, Gunter v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 200 U. S. 273, 284(1906), or else if the State makes a "clear declaration" that it

intends to submit itself to our jurisdiction, Great Northern
Life Ins. Co. v. Read, 322 U. S. 47, 54 (1944). See also Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U. S.,
at 99 (State's consent to suit must be "unequivocally ex-pressed"). Thus, a State does not consent to suit in federal

court merely by consenting to suit in the courts of its owncreation.

Smith v. Reeves, 178 U. S. 436, 441-445 (1900).
Nor does it consent to suit in federal court merely by statingits intention to "sue and be sued,"

Florida Dept. of Health
and Rehabilitative Servs. v. Florida Nursing Home Assn.,
450 U. S. 147, 149-150 (1981) (per curiam), or even by authorizing suits against it " `in any court of competent jurisdiction,' " Kennecott Copper Corp. v. State Tax Comm'n, 327
U. S. 573, 577-579 (1946). We have even held that a State
may, absent any contractual commitment to the contrary,
alter the conditions of its waiver and apply those changes to
a pending suit. Beers v. Arkansas, supra.

There is no suggestion here that respondent Florida Prepaid expressly consented to being sued in federal court.
Nor is this a case in which the State has affirmatively invoked our jurisdiction. Rather, petitioner College Savings
and the United States both maintain that Florida Prepaid
has "impliedly" or "constructively" waived its immunity from
Lanham Act suit. They do so on the authority of Parden v.
Terminal R. Co. of Ala. Docks Dept., 377 U. S. 184 (1964)--
an elliptical opinion that stands at the nadir of our waiver
(and, for that matter, sovereign-immunity) jurisprudence.
In Parden, we permitted employees of a railroad owned and
operated by Alabama to bring an action under the Federal
Employers' Liability Act (FELA) against their employer.
Despite the absence of any provision in the statute specifically referring to the States, we held that the Act authorized
suits against the States by virtue of its general provision
subjecting to suit "[e]very common carrier by railroad . . .

engaging in commerce between . . . the several States," 45U. S. C. $ 51 (1940 ed.). We further held that Alabama had

waived its immunity from FELA suit even though Alabamalaw expressly disavowed any such waiver:

"By enacting the [FELA] . . . Congress conditioned theright to operate a railroad in interstate commerce upon
amenability to suit in federal court as provided by theAct; by thereafter operating a railroad in interstate
commerce, Alabama must be taken to have accepted thatcondition and thus to have consented to suit." 377
U. S., at 192.
The four dissenting Justices in Parden refused to infer a
waiver because Congress had not "expressly declared" thata

State operating in commerce would be subject to liability,
but they went on to acknowledge--in a concession that,
strictly speaking, was not necessary to their analysis--thatCongress possessed the power to effect such a waiver of the

State's constitutionally protected immunity so long as it didso with clarity.

Id., at 198-200 (opinion of White, J.).
Only nine years later, in Employees of Dept. of Public
Health and Welfare of Mo. v. Department of Public Health
and Welfare of Mo., 411 U. S. 279 (1973), we began to retreatfrom

Parden. That case held--in an opinion written by one
of the Parden dissenters over the solitary dissent of Parden's
author--that the State of Missouri was immune from a suitbrought under the Fair Labor Standards Act by employees

of its state health facilities. Although the statute specifi-cally covered the state hospitals in question, see 29 U. S. C.

$ 203(d) (1964 ed.), and such coverage was unquestionably enforceable in federal court by the United States, 411 U. S., at
285-286, we did not think that the statute expressed with
clarity Congress's intention to supersede the States' immunity from suits brought by individuals. We "put to one side"
the Parden case, which we characterized as involving "dramatic circumstances" and "a rather isolated state activity,"

Opinion of the Court

411 U. S., at 285, unlike the provision of the Fair LaborStandards Act in question that applied to a broad class

of state employees. We also distinguished the railroad inParden on the ground that it was "operated for profit" "in
the area where private persons and corporations normallyran the enterprise." 411 U. S., at 284. Justice Marshall,
joined by Justice Stewart, went even further, concluding thatalthough, in their view, Congress

had clearly purportedto subject the States to suits by individuals in federal courts,

it lacked the constitutional authority to do so. Id., at 287,289-290 (opinion concurring in result).

The next year, we observed (in dictum) that there is
"no place" for the doctrine of constructive waiver in oursovereign-immunity jurisprudence, and we emphasized

that we would "find waiver only where stated by the mostexpress language or by such overwhelming implications
from the text as [will] leave no room for any other reasonableconstruction."

Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U. S. 651, 673 (1974)
(internal quotation marks omitted). Several Terms later,in

Welch v. Texas Dept. of Highways and Public Transp.,
483 U. S. 468 (1987), although we expressly avoided addressing the constitutionality of Congress's conditioning a State'sengaging in Commerce Clause activity upon the State's

waiver of sovereign immunity, we said there was "no doubtthat

Eleventh Amendment immunity is no longer good law," andoverruled

Parden "to the extent [it] is inconsistent with the

2 In response to this string of cases criticizing or narrowing the holding
of Parden, Justice Breyer holds up three post-Parden cases as decisions
that "support[ed]" Parden, post, at 696, or at least "carefully avoided calling [it] into question," post, at 698. His perception of "support" in Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S. 234 (1985), rests upon nothing
more substantial than the fact that the case "suggest[ed] that a waiver

Opinion of the Court
College Savings and the United States concede, as they
surely must, that these intervening decisions have seriously
limited the holding of Parden. They maintain, however,
that Employees and Welch are distinguishable, and that a
core principle of Parden remains good law. A Parden-style
waiver of immunity, they say, is still possible after Employees and Welch so long as the following two conditions are
satisfied: First, Congress must provide unambiguously that
the State will be subject to suit if it engages in certain specified conduct governed by federal regulation. Second, the
State must voluntarily elect to engage in the federally regulated conduct that subjects it to suit. In this latter regard,
their argument goes, a State is never deemed to have constructively waived its sovereign immunity by engaging in
activities that it cannot realistically choose to abandon, such

may be found in a State's acceptance of a federal grant." Post, at 696.
But we make the same suggestion today, while utterly rejecting Parden.
As we explain elsewhere in detail, see infra, at 686-687, conditions
attached to a State's receipt of federal funds are simply not analogous to
Parden-style conditions attached to a State's decision to engage in otherwise lawful commercial activity. Justice Breyer's second case, Welch,
overruled Parden in part, as we discuss above, and we think it quite impossible to believe that the following statement in the opinion did not
"questio[n] the holding of Parden that the Court today discards," post, at
698: "We assume, without deciding or intimating a view of the question,
that the authority of Congress to subject unconsenting States to suit in
federal court is not confined to $ 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment." 483
U. S., at 475. Calling what a prior case has flatly decided a "question" in
need of "deciding," and (lest there be any doubt on the point) making it
clear that we "intimat[e] no view" as to whether the answer given by that
prior case was correct, surely was handwriting on the wall which even an
inept cryptologist would recognize as spelling out the caption of today's
opinion. As for Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44 (1996), we
explain elsewhere, see infra, at 682-684, how that case was logically and
practically inconsistent with Parden, even though it did not expressly
overrule it. Justice Breyer realizes this well enough, or else his call
for an overruling of that case, which occupies almost half of his dissent,
see post, at 699-705, would be supremely irrelevant to the matter before us.

Opinion of the Court

as the operation of a police force; but constructive waiver isappropriate where a State runs an enterprise for profit, operates in a field traditionally occupied by private persons orcorporations, engages in activities sufficiently removed from
"core [state] functions," Reply Brief for United States 3, or
otherwise acts as a "market participant" in interstate com-merce, cf.

White v. Massachusetts Council of Constr. Employers, Inc., 460 U. S. 204, 206-208 (1983). On this theory,Florida Prepaid constructively waived its immunity from

suit by engaging in the voluntary and nonessential activityof selling and advertising a for-profit educational investment
vehicle in interstate commerce after being put on notice by
the clear language of the TRCA that it would be subject to
Lanham Act liability for doing so.

We think that the constructive-waiver experiment of Parden was ill conceived, and see no merit in attempting to
salvage any remnant of it. As we explain below in detail,
Parden broke sharply with prior cases, and is fundamentally
incompatible with later ones. We have never applied the
holding of Parden to another statute, and in fact have
narrowed the case in every subsequent opinion in which it
has been under consideration. In short, Parden stands as
an anomaly in the jurisprudence of sovereign immunity, and
indeed in the jurisprudence of constitutional law. Today, we
drop the other shoe: Whatever may remain of our decision
in Parden is expressly overruled.

To begin with, we cannot square Parden with our cases
requiring that a State's express waiver of sovereign immunity be unequivocal. See, e. g., Great Northern Life Ins. Co.
v. Read, 322 U. S. 47 (1944). The whole point of requiring a
"clear declaration" by the State of its waiver is to be certain
that the State in fact consents to suit. But there is little
reason to assume actual consent based upon the State's mere
presence in a field subject to congressional regulation.
There is a fundamental difference between a State's expressing unequivocally that it waives its immunity and Congress's

527US2 Unit: $U90 [05-09-01 13:06:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN

681Cite as: 527 U. S. 666 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
expressing unequivocally its intention that if the State takescertain action it shall be deemed to have waived that immunity. In the latter situation, the most that can be said withcertainty is that the State has been put on notice that Congress intends to subject it to suits brought by individuals.That is very far from concluding that

the State made an "alto-gether voluntary" decision to waive its immunity. Beers, 20

How., at 529.3Indeed, Parden-style waivers are simply unheard of in the
context of other constitutionally protected privileges. Aswe said in Edelman, "[c]onstructive consent is not a doctrine
commonly associated with the surrender of constitutionalrights." 415 U. S., at 673. For example, imagine if Congress amended the securities laws to provide with unmistak-able clarity that anyone committing fraud in connection with

3 In an attempt to cast doubt on our characterization of Parden as a
groundbreaking case, Justice Breyer points to three earlier decisions
which allegedly demonstrate that Parden worked no major change.
These cases, however, have only the most tenuous relation to Parden's
actual holding--as one might suspect from the dissent's soft-pedaled description of them as "roughly comparable" and involving (in quotation
marks) " `waivers.' " Post, at 696. The first two, United States v. California, 297 U. S. 175 (1936), and California v. Taylor, 353 U. S. 553 (1957),
involved neither state immunity from suit nor waiver, but the entirely
different question whether substantive provisions of Commerce Clause
legislation applied to the States. The former concerned a suit brought
against a State by the United States (a situation in which state sovereign
immunity does not exist, see United States v. Texas, 143 U. S. 621 (1892)),
and the latter expressly acknowledged that "the Eleventh Amendment"
was "not before us," 353 U. S., at 568, n. 16. The last case, Gardner v.
New Jersey, 329 U. S. 565 (1947), which held that a bankruptcy court can
entertain a trustee's objections to a claim filed by a State, stands for the
unremarkable proposition that a State waives its sovereign immunity by
voluntarily invoking the jurisdiction of the federal courts. See supra, at
675-676. In sum, none of these cases laid any foundation for Parden--
whose author was quite correct in acknowledging that it "presented a
question of first impression," Employees of Dept. of Public Health and
Welfare of Mo. v. Department of Public Health and Welfare of Mo., 411
U. S. 279, 299 (1973) (Brennan, J., dissenting).

Opinion of the Court

the buying or selling of securities in interstate commerce
would not be entitled to a jury in any federal criminal prosecution of such fraud. Would persons engaging in securities
fraud after the adoption of such an amendment be deemed to
have "constructively waived" their constitutionally protected
rights to trial by jury in criminal cases? After all, the trading of securities is not so vital an activity that any one person's decision to trade cannot be regarded as a voluntary
choice. The answer, of course, is no. The classic description of an effective waiver of a constitutional right is the
"intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known
right or privilege." Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U. S. 458, 464
(1938). "[C]ourts indulge every reasonable presumption
against waiver " of fundamental constituti onal rights.
Aetna Ins. Co. v. Kennedy ex rel. Bogash, 301 U. S. 389, 393
(1937). See also Ohio Bell Telephone Co. v. Public Util.
Comm'n of Ohio, 301 U. S. 292, 307 (1937) (we "do not presume acquiescence in the loss of fundamental rights").
State sovereign immunity, no less than the right to trial by
jury in criminal cases, is constitutionally protected. Great
Northern, supra, at 51; Pennhurst, 465 U. S., at 98. And
in the context of federal sovereign immunity--obviously the
closest analogy to the present case--it is well established
that waivers are not implied. See, e. g., United States v.
King, 395 U. S. 1, 4 (1969) (describing the "settled propositio[n]" that the United States' waiver of sovereign immunity
"cannot be implied but must be unequivocally expressed").
We see no reason why the rule should be different with
respect to state sovereign immunity.

Given how anomalous it is to speak of the "constructive
waiver" of a constitutionally protected privilege, it is not
surprising that the very cornerstone of the Parden opinion
was the notion that state sovereign immunity is not constitutionally grounded. Parden's discussion of waiver began
with the observation:

527US2 Unit: $U90 [05-09-01 13:06:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN

683Cite as: 527 U. S. 666 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
"By empowering Congress to regulate commerce . . .the States necessarily surrendered any portion of their

sovereignty that would stand in the way of such regula-tion. Since imposition of the FELA right of action
upon interstate railroads is within the congressionalregulatory power, it must follow that application of the
Act to such a railroad cannot be precluded by sovereignimmunity." 377 U. S., at 192.

See also id., at 193-194, n. 11. Our more recent decisionin

Seminole Tribe expressly repudiates that proposition, andin formally overruling Parden we do no more than make

explicit what that case implied.Recognizing a congressional power to exact constructive
waivers of sovereign immunity through the exercise of Arti-cle I powers would also, as a practical matter, permit Congress to circumvent the antiabrogation holding of Seminole
Tribe. Forced waiver and abrogation are not even differentsides of the same coin--they are the same side of the same

coin. "All congressional creations of private rights of actionattach recovery to the defendant's commission of some act,
or possession of some status, in a field where Congress hasauthority to regulate conduct. Thus, all federal prescriptions are, insofar as their prospective application is con-cerned, in a sense conditional, and--to the extent that the
objects of the prescriptions consciously engage in the activ-ity or hold the status that produces liability--can be redescribed as invitations to `waiver.' " Pennsylvania v. Union
Gas Co., 491 U. S. 1, 43 (1989) (Scalia, J., dissenting). Seealso Fitzpatrick, 427 U. S., at 451-452 (referring to congressional intent to "abrogate" state sovereign immunity as a"necessary predicate" for

Parden-style waiver). There islittle more than a verbal distinction between saying that

Congress can make Florida liable to private parties for falseor misleading advertising in interstate commerce of its prepaid tuition program, and saying the same thing but adding

POSTSECONDARY ED. EXPENSE BD.

Opinion of the Court

at the end "if Florida chooses to engage in such advertising."
As further evidence that constructive waiver is little more
than abrogation under another name, consider the revealing
facts of this case: The statutory provision relied upon to
demonstrate that Florida constructively waived its sovereign immunity is the very same provision that purported to
abrogate it.

Nor do we think that the constitutionally grounded principle of state sovereign immunity is any less robust where, as
here, the asserted basis for constructive waiver is conduct
that the State realistically could choose to abandon, that is
undertaken for profit, that is traditionally performed by private citizens and corporations, and that otherwise resembles
the behavior of "market participants." Permitting abrogation or constructive waiver of the constitutional right only
when these conditions exist would of course limit the evil--
but it is hard to say that that limitation has any more
support in text or tradition than, say, limiting abrogation or
constructive waiver to the last Friday of the month. Since
sovereign immunity itself was not traditionally limited by
these factors, and since they have no bearing upon the voluntariness of the waiver, there is no principled reason why they
should enter into our waiver analysis. When we held in
Seminole Tribe that sovereign immunity barred an action
brought under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act against
the State of Florida for its alleged failure to negotiate a gambling compact with the Seminole Tribe of Indians, we did not
pause to consider whether Florida's decision not to negotiate
was somehow involuntary. Nor did we pause to consider
whether running a tugboat towing service at "fair and reasonable rates" was for profit, was traditionally performed by
private citizens and corporations, and otherwise resembled
the behavior of "market participants" when we held, in Ex
parte New York, 256 U. S. 490 (1921), that sovereign immunity foreclosed an admiralty action against the State of New

Opinion of the Court
York for damages caused by the State's engaging in such
activity. Hans itself involved an action against Louisiana
to recover coupons on a bond--the issuance of which surely
rendered Louisiana a participant in the financial markets.

The "market participant" cases from our dormant
Commerce Clause jurisprudence, relied upon by the United
States, are inapposite. See, e. g., White v. Massachusetts
Council of Constr. Employers, Inc., 460 U. S. 204 (1983);
Reeves, Inc. v. Stake, 447 U. S. 429 (1980); and Hughes v.
Alexandria Scrap Corp., 426 U. S. 794 (1976). Those cases
hold that, where a State acts as a participant in the private
market, it may prefer the goods or services of its own citizens, even though it could not do so while acting as a market
regulator. Since "state proprietary activities may be, and
often are, burdened with the same restrictions imposed on
private market participants," "[e]venhandedness suggests
that, when acting as proprietors, States should similarly
share existing freedoms from federal constraints, including
the inherent limits of the [dormant] Commerce Clause."
White, supra, at 207-208, n. 3. The "market participant"
exception to judicially created dormant Commerce Clause
restrictions makes sense because the evil addressed by those
restrictions--the prospect that States will use custom duties,
exclusionary trade regulations, and other exercises of
governmental power (as opposed to the expenditure of state
resources) to favor their own citizens, see Hughes, supra,
at 808--is entirely absent where the States are buying and
selling in the market. In contrast, a suit by an individual against an unconsenting State is the very evil at which
the Eleventh Amendment is directed--and it exists whether
or not the State is acting for profit, in a traditionally
"private" enterprise, and as a "market participant." In the
sovereign-immunity context, moreover, "[e]venhandness"
between individuals and States is not to be expected: "[T]he
constitutional role of the States sets them apart from other

The United States points to two other contexts in whichit asserts we have permitted Congress, in the exercise of

its Article I powers, to extract "constructive waivers" ofstate sovereign immunity. In

Petty v. Tennessee-MissouriBridge Comm'n, 359 U. S. 275 (1959), we held that a bistate

commission which had been created pursuant to an interstatecompact (and which we assumed partook of state sovereign
immunity) had consented to suit by reason of a suability pro-vision attached to the congressional approval of the compact.
And we have held in such cases as South Dakota v. Dole, 483U. S. 203 (1987), that Congress may, in the exercise of its
spending power, condition its grant of funds to the Statesupon their taking certain actions that Congress could not
require them to take, and that acceptance of the funds entailsan agreement to the actions. These cases seem to us fundamentally different from the present one. Under the Com-pact Clause, U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 10, cl. 3, States

cannotform an interstate compact without first obtaining the express consent of Congress; the granting of such consent is agratuity. So also, Congress has no obligation to use its
Spending Clause power to disburse funds to the States; such

4 As for the suggestion of Justice Breyer that we limit state sovereign
immunity to noncommercial state activities because Congress has so limited foreign sovereign immunity, in accord with the "modern trend," see
post, at 699 (dissenting opinion) (citing the Foreign Sovereign Immunities
Act of 1976 (FSIA), 28 U. S. C. $ 1605(a)(2)), see also Justice Stevens's
dissent, post, at 692: This proposal ignores the fact that state sovereign
immunity, unlike foreign sovereign immunity, is a constitutional doctrine
that is meant to be both immutable by Congress and resistant to trends.
The text of the Eleventh Amendment, of course, makes no distinction between commercial and noncommercial state activities--and so if we were
to combine Justice Breyer's literalistic interpretation of that Amendment with his affection for FSIA, we would have a "commercial activities"
exception for all suits against States except those commenced in federal
court by citizens of another State, a disposition that hardly "makes sense,"

Opinion of the Court
funds are gifts. In the present case, however, what Con-gress threatens if the State refuses to agree to its condition

is not the denial of a gift or gratuity, but a sanction: exclusionof the State from otherwise permissible activity.

Justice
Breyer's dissent acknowledges the intuitive difference be-tween the two, but asserts that it disappears when the gift

that is threatened to be withheld is substantial enough.
Post, at 697. Perhaps so, which is why, in cases involvingconditions attached to federal funding, we have acknowledged that "the financial inducement offered by Congressmight be so coercive as to pass the point at which `pressure
turns into compulsion.' " Dole, supra, at 211, quoting Steward Machine Co. v. Davis, 301 U. S. 548, 590 (1937). In anyevent, we think where the constitutionally guaranteed protection of the States' sovereign immunity is involved, thepoint of coercion is automatically passed--and the voluntariness of waiver destroyed--when what is attached to the re-fusal to waive is the exclusion of the State from otherwise
lawful activity. V

The principal thrust of Justice Breyer's dissent is anattack upon the very legitimacy of state sovereign immunity
itself. In this regard, Justice Breyer and the other dis-senters proclaim that they are "not

yet ready," post, at 699(emphasis added), to adhere to the still-warm precedent of

Seminole Tribe and to the 110-year-old decision in Hansthat supports it.

5 Accordingly, Justice Breyer reiterates

5 Justice Breyer purports to "accept this Court's pre-Seminole Tribe
sovereign immunity decisions," post, at 699 (dissenting opinion), but by
that he could not mean Hans, but rather only the distorted view of Hans
that prevailed briefly between Parden and Seminole Tribe. Parden was
the first case to suggest that the sovereign immunity announced in Hans
was so fragile a flower that it could be abrogated under Article I--a suggestion contrary to the reality that Hans itself involved a congressional
conferral of jurisdiction enacted under Article I. See Pennsylvania v.
Union Gas, 491 U. S. 1, 36-37 (1989) (Scalia, J., dissenting). Moreover,
that conferral of jurisdiction was combined, in Hans, with a substantive

Opinion of the Court

(but only in outline form, thankfully) the now-fashionablerevisionist accounts of the Eleventh Amendment set forth

in other opinions in a degree of repetitive detail that hasdespoiled our northern woods. Compare post, at 700-701,
with Atascadero, supra, at 258-302 (Brennan, J., dissenting);
Welch, supra, at 504-516 (Brennan, J., dissenting); SeminoleTribe, 517 U. S., at 76-99 (

Souter, J., dissenting). The argumentsrecited in these sources have been soundly refuted, and the

position for which they have been marshaled has been re-jected by constitutional tradition and precedent as clear and
conclusive, and almost as venerable, as that which consignsdebate over whether Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137
(1803), was wrongly decided to forums more otherworldlythan ours. See Union Gas, 491 U. S., at 33-34, 35-42

further need be said except two minor observations peculiarto this case.

claim under the Contracts Clause of the Constitution itself, which one
would think to have greater, rather than lesser, abrogative force than a
substantive statute enacted pursuant to the Commerce Clause. Justice
Breyer would apparently interpose that the statute in Hans did not expressly " `purpor[t] to pierce state immunity,' " post, at 700, quoting Seminole Tribe, 517 U. S., at 119 (Souter, J., dissenting)--but the opinion in
Hans did not allude to that refinement, nor did Parden think it made any
difference. The so-called "clear statement rule" was not even adumbrated until nine years after Parden, in Employees, 411 U. S., at 284-285.
It is difficult to square Justice Breyer's reliance upon the distinction
that the present case involves a federal question (and is therefore not
explicitly covered by the Eleventh Amendment), see post, at 700-701, with
its professed fidelity to Hans, the whole point of which was that the sovereign immunity reflected in (rather than created by) the Eleventh Amendment transcends the narrow text of the Amendment itself. Or to put it
differently, the "pre-Seminole Tribe sovereign immunity decisions" to
which Justice Breyer pledges allegiance appear to include Chisholm v.
Georgia, 2 Dall. 419 (1793). But see U. S. Const., Amdt. 11.

Opinion of the Court
First, Justice Breyer and the other dissenters haveadopted a decidedly perverse theory of

stare decisis. While
finding themselves entirely unconstrained by a venerableprecedent such as

Hans, embedded within our legal system
for over a century, see, e. g., Welch, 483 U. S., at 494, n. 27;
Union Gas, supra, at 34-35 (Scalia, J., dissenting), at thesame time they cling desperately to an anomalous and

severely undermined decision (Parden) from the 1960's.Surely this approach to

stare decisis is exactly backwards--
unless, of course, one wishes to use it as a weapon ratherthan a guide, in which case any old approach will do. Second, while we stress that the following observation has no
bearing upon our resolution of this case, we find it puzzling
that Justice Breyer would choose this occasion to criticize
our sovereign-immunity jurisprudence as being ungrounded
in constitutional text, since the present lawsuit that he would
allow to go forward--having apparently been commenced

As for the more diffuse treatment of the subject of federalism contained in the last portion of Justice Breyer's opinion: It is alarming to learn that so many Members of this
Court subscribe to a theory of federalism that rejects "the
details of any particular federalist doctrine"--which it says
can and should "change to reflect the Nation's changing
needs"--and that puts forward as the only "unchanging goal"
of federalism worth mentioning "the protection of liberty,"
which it believes is most directly achieved by "promoting
the sharing among citizens of governmental decisionmaking

Opinion of the Court

authority," which in turn demands (we finally come to thepoint) "necessary legislative flexibility" for the people's representatives in Congress. Post, at 702-703. The proposi-tion that "the protection of liberty" is most directly achieved
by "promoting the sharing among citizens of governmental
decisionmaking authority" might well have dropped fromthe lips of Robespierre, but surely not from those of Madison, Jefferson, or Hamilton, whose north star was that gov-ernmental power, even--indeed, especially--governmental
power wielded by the people, had to be dispersed and countered. And to say that the degree of dispersal to the States,
and hence the degree of check by the States, is to be governed by Congress's need for "legislative flexibility" is to
deny federalism utterly. (Justice Breyer's opinion comes
close to admitting this when the only example of a "federalism" constraint that it can bear to acknowledge as being
appropriate for judicial recognition is the invalidation of a
State's law under--of all things, given the passion for text
that characterizes some parts of his opinion--the "dormant
Commerce Clause," post, at 703.) Legislative flexibility on
the part of Congress will be the touchstone of federalism
when the capacity to support combustion becomes the acid
test of a fire extinguisher. Congressional flexibility is desirable, of course--but only within the bounds of federal power
established by the Constitution. Beyond those bounds (the
theory of our Constitution goes), it is a menace. Our opinion
today has sought to discern what the bounds are; Justice
Breyer's dissent denies them any permanent place.

Finally, we must comment upon Justice Breyer's
comparison of our decision today with the discredited
substantive-due-process case of Lochner v. New York, 198
U. S. 45 (1905). It resembles Lochner, of course, in the respect that it rejects a novel assertion of governmental power
which the legislature believed to be justified. But if that
alone were enough to qualify as a mini-Lochner, the list of
mini-Lochners would be endless. Most of our judgments in527US2 Unit: $U90 [05-09-01 13:06:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Stevens, J., dissenting
validating state and federal laws fit that description. Wehad always thought that the distinctive feature of Lochner,

nicely captured in Justice Holmes's dissenting remark about"Mr. Herbert Spencer's Social Statics," id., at 75, was that it
sought to impose a particular economic philosophy upon theConstitution. And we think that feature aptly characterizes, not our opinion, but Justice Breyer's dissent, whichbelieves that States should not enjoy the normal constitutional protections of sovereign immunity when they step outof their proper economic role to engage in (we are sure Mr.
Herbert Spencer would be shocked) "ordinary commercialventures,"

post, at 694. What ever happened to the needfor "legislative flexibility"?

Concluding, for the foregoing reasons, that the sovereignimmunity of the State of Florida was neither validly abrogated by the Trademark Remedy Clarification Act, norvoluntarily waived by the State's activities in interstate
commerce, we hold that the federal courts are without juris-diction to entertain this suit against an arm of the State of
Florida. The judgment of the Third Circuit dismissing theaction is affirmed.

It is so ordered.
Justice Stevens, dissenting.
This case has been argued and decided on the basis ofassumptions that may not be entirely correct. Accepting

Justice
Breyer's dissent, which I have joined. I believe, however,that the importance of this case and the other two "states

assume that Florida Prepaid is an "arm of the State" of Flor-ida because its activities relate to the State's educational pro527US2 Unit: $U90 [05-09-01 13:06:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN

grams. Ante, at 671. But the validity of that assumptionis doubtful if the Court's jurisprudence in this area is to be

based primarily on present-day assumptions about the statusof the doctrine of sovereign immunity in the 18th century.
Sovereigns did not then play the kind of role in the commercial marketplace that they do today. In future cases, it maytherefore be appropriate to limit the coverage of state sovereign immunity by treating the commercial enterprises of theStates like the commercial activities of foreign sovereigns
under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976.1The majority also assumes that petitioner's complaint has
alleged a violation of the Lanham Act, but not one that issufficiently serious to amount to a "deprivation" of its property. Ante, at 674-675. I think neither of those assump-tions is relevant to the principal issue raised in this case,
namely, whether Congress had the constitutional power to
authorize suits against States and state instrumentalities forsuch a violation. In my judgment the Constitution granted

it ample power to do so.2 Section 5 of the FourteenthAmendment authorizes Congress to enact appropriate legislation to prevent deprivations of property without due proc-ess. Unlike the majority, I am persuaded that the Trademark Remedy Clarification Act was a valid exercise of thatpower, even if Florida Prepaid's allegedly false advertising

1 See 28 U. S. C. $ 1605(a)(2) (commercial activity exception to foreign
sovereign immunity). The statute provides the following definition of
"commercial activity": "either a regular course of commercial conduct or
a particular commercial transaction or act. The commercial character of
an activity shall be determined by reference to the nature of the course
of conduct or particular transaction or act, rather than by reference to its
purpose." $ 1603(d).

2 As we held in Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co., 491 U. S. 1, 23 (1989),

the Commerce Clause granted Congress the power to abrogate the States'
common-law defense of sovereign immunity. I remain convinced that that
case was correctly decided for the reasons stated in the principal and concurring opinions.

in this case did not violate the Constitution. My conclusionrests on two premises that the Court rejects.

First, in my opinion "the activity of doing business, or theactivity of making a profit," ante, at 675, is a form of property. The asset that often appears on a company's balancesheet as "good will" is the substantial equivalent of that "activity." It is the same kind of "property" that Congress de-scribed in $ 7 of the Sherman Act, 26 Stat. 210, and in $ 4 of
the Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 731. A State's deliberate destruc-tion of a going business is surely a deprivation of property
within the meaning of the Due Process Clause.Second, the validity of a congressional decision to abrogate
sovereign immunity in a category of cases does not dependon the strength of the claim asserted in a particular case
within that category. Instead, the decision depends onwhether Congress had a reasonable basis for concluding that
abrogation was necessary to prevent violations that wouldotherwise occur. Given the presumption of validity that
supports all federal statutes, I believe the Court must shoul-der the burden of demonstrating why the judgment of the
Congress of the United States should not command our re-spect. It has not done so.

For these reasons, as well as those expressed by Justice
Breyer, I respectfully dissent.

Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Stevens, Justice
Souter, and Justice Ginsburg join, dissenting.

The Court holds that Congress, in the exercise of its com-merce power, cannot require a State to waive its immunity

from suit in federal court even where the State engages inactivity from which it might readily withdraw, such as federally regulated commercial activity. This Court has previously held to the contrary. Parden v. Terminal R. Co. of
Ala. Docks Dept., 377 U. S. 184 (1964). I would not abandon
that precedent.

Breyer, J., dissenting

IThirty-five years ago this Court unanimously subscribed

to the holding that the Court today overrules. JusticeWhite, writing for four Members of the Court who dissented
on a different issue, succinctly described that holding as
follows:

"[I]t is within the power of Congress to condition aState's permit to engage in the interstate transportation

business on a waiver of the State's sovereign immunityfrom suits arising out of such business. Congress might
well determine that allowing regulable conduct such as
the operation of a railroad to be undertaken by a bodylegally immune from liability directly resulting from

these operations is so inimical to the purposes of its reg-ulation that the State must be put to the option of either
foregoing participation in the conduct or consenting tolegal responsibility for injury caused thereby."

Id., at
198 (opinion of White, J., joined by Douglas, Harlan, and
Stewart, JJ.).

The majority, seeking to justify the overruling of so cleara precedent, describes

Parden's holding as a constitutional
"anomaly" that "broke sharply with prior cases," that is"fundamentally incompatible with later ones," and that has

been "narrowed . . . in every subsequent opinion." Ante, at
680. Parden is none of those things.Far from being anomalous,

Parden's holding finds support
in reason and precedent. When a State engages in ordinarycommercial ventures, it acts like a private person, outside

the area of its "core" responsibilities, and in a way unlikely
to prove essential to the fulfillment of a basic governmental
obligation. A Congress that decides to regulate those state
commercial activities rather than to exempt the State likely
believes that an exemption, by treating the State differently
from identically situated private persons, would threaten the
objectives of a federal regulatory program aimed primarily

Breyer, J., dissenting
at private conduct. Compare, e. g., 12 U. S. C. $ 1841(b)(1994 ed., Supp. III) (exempting state companies from regulations covering federal bank holding companies); 15 U. S. C.$ 77c(a)(2) (exempting state-issued securities from federal
securities laws); and 29 U. S. C. $ 652(5) (exempting States
from the definition of "employer[s]" subject to federal occu-pational safety and health laws), with 11 U. S. C. $ 106(a)

(subjecting States to federal bankruptcy court judgments);15 U. S. C. $ 1122(a) (subjecting States to suit for violation of
Lanham Act); 17 U. S. C. $ 511(a) (subjecting States to suitfor copyright infringement); and 35 U. S. C. $ 271(h) (subjecting States to suit for patent infringement). And a Congress
that includes the State not only within its substantive regulatory rules but also (expressly) within a related system of
private remedies likely believes that a remedial exemption
would similarly threaten that program. See Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd. v. College Savings Bank,
ante, at 656-657 (Stevens, J., dissenting). It thereby avoids
an enforcement gap which, when allied with the pressures of
a competitive marketplace, could place the State's regulated
private competitors at a significant disadvantage.

These considerations make Congress' need to possess the
power to condition entry into the market upon a waiver of
sovereign immunity (as "necessary and proper" to the exercise of its commerce power) unusually strong, for to deny
Congress that power would deny Congress the power effectively to regulate private conduct. Cf. California v. Taylor,
353 U. S. 553, 566 (1957). At the same time they make a
State's need to exercise sovereign immunity unusually weak,
for the State is unlikely to have to supply what private firms
already supply, nor may it fairly demand special treatment,
even to protect the public purse, when it does so. Neither
can one easily imagine what the Constitution's Founders
would have thought about the assertion of sovereign immunity in this special context. These considerations, differing
in kind or degree from those that would support a general

Breyer, J., dissenting

congressional "abrogation" power, indicate that Parden'sholding is sound, irrespective of this Court's decisions in

Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44 (1996), and
Alden v. Maine, post, p. 706.

Neither did Parden break "sharply with prior cases."
Parden itself cited authority that found related "waivers" inat least roughly comparable circumstances.

United States
v. California, 297 U. S. 175 (1936), for example, held thata State, "by engaging in interstate commerce by rail, has

subjected itself to the commerce power," id., at 185, whichamounted to a waiver of a (different though related) substantive immunity. See also Taylor, supra, at 568. Parden also
relied on authority holding that States seeking necessary
congressional approval for an interstate compact had, "by
venturing into the [federal] realm `assume[d] the [waiver of
sovereign immunity] conditions . . . attached.' " 377 U. S.,
at 196 (quoting Petty v. Tennessee-Missouri Bridge Comm'n,
359 U. S. 275, 281-282 (1959)). Earlier case law had found a
waiver of sovereign immunity in a State's decision to bring
a creditor's claim in bankruptcy. See Gardner v. New Jersey, 329 U. S. 565, 573-574 (1947). Later case law, suggesting that a waiver may be found in a State's acceptance of a
federal grant, see Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473
U. S. 234, 247 (1985), supports Parden's conclusion. Where
is the sharp break?

The majority has only one answer to this question. It believes that this Court's case law requires any "waiver" to be
"express" and "unequivocal." Ante, at 680. But the cases
to which I have just referred show that is not so. The majority tries to explain some of those cases away with the
statement that what is attached to the refusal to waive in
those cases is "the denial of a gift or gratuity," while what
is involved here is "the exclusion of the State from [an] otherwise lawful activity." Ante, at 687. This statement does
not explain away a difference. It simply states a difference
that demands an explanation.

527US2 Unit: $U90 [05-09-01 13:06:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN

697Cite as: 527 U. S. 666 (1999)
Breyer, J., dissenting
The statement does appeal to an intuition, namely, that itis somehow easier for the State, and hence more voluntary,

to forgo "a gift or gratuity" than to refrain from "otherwiselawful activity," or that it is somehow more compelling or
oppressive for Congress to forbid the State to perform
an "otherwise lawful" act than to withhold "beneficence."But the force of this intuition depends upon the example that

one chooses as its illustration; and realistic examples suggestthe intuition is not sound in the present context. Given
the amount of money at stake, it may be harder, not easier,for a State to refuse highway funds than to refrain from entering the investment services business. See U. S. Dept.
of Commerce, Bureau of Census, Federal Aid to States for
Fiscal Year 1998, p. 17 (Apr. 1999) (Federal Government
provided over $20 billion to States for highways in 1998). It
is more compelling and oppressive for Congress to threaten
to withhold from a State funds needed to educate its children
than to threaten to subject it to suit when it competes directly with a private investment company. See id., at 5
(Federal Government provided over $21 billion to States for
education in 1998). The distinction that the majority seeks
to make--drawn in terms of gifts and entitlements--does
not exist.

The majority is also wrong to say that this Court has "narrowed" Parden in its "subsequent opinion[s]," ante, at 680,
at least in any way relevant to today's decision. Parden considered two separate issues: (1) Does Congress have the
power to require a State to waive its immunity? (2) How
clearly must Congress speak when it does so? The Court
has narrowed Parden only in respect to the second issue, not
the first; but today we are concerned only with the first.
The Court in Employees of Dept. of Public Health and Welfare of Mo. v. Department of Public Health and Welfare of
Mo., 411 U. S. 279 (1973), for example, discussed whether
Congress had, or had not, "lift[ed]" sovereign immunity, not
whether it could, or could not, have done so. Id., at 285

527US2 Unit: $U90 [05-09-01 13:06:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN

POSTSECONDARY ED. EXPENSE BD.

Breyer, J., dissenting

("Congress did not lift the sovereign immunity of the States"
(emphasis added)). And Employees' limitation of Parden,
to "the area where private persons and corporations normally ran the enterprise," took place in the context of clarity, not power. 411 U. S., at 284 (specifying that "Congress
can act" outside the limited area (emphasis added)). Although two Justices would have limited Parden's holding in
respect to power, that limitation would simply have required
Congress to give the States advance notice of the consequence (loss of sovereign immunity), which, as they noted,
happened in Parden. 411 U. S., at 296-297 (Marshall, J., concurring in result).

The remaining cases the majority mentions offer it no
greater support. One said, "We assume, without deciding
or intimating a view of the question, that the authority of
Congress to subject unconsenting States to suit in federal
court is not confined to $ 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment."
Welch v. Texas Dept. of Highways and Public Transp., 483
U. S. 468, 475 (1987). Two others also considered legislative
clarity, not power. Atascadero State Hospital, supra, at 247
(Rehabilitation Act "falls far short" of clearly indicating a
waiver by a State accepting funds under the Act); Edelman
v. Jordan, 415 U. S. 651, 674 (1974) (same for Social Security
Act). Even Seminole Tribe carefully avoided calling Parden into question. While specifying that Congress cannot,
in the exercise of its Article I powers, "abrogate unilaterally
the States' immunity from suit," 517 U. S., at 59, it left open
the scope of the term "unilaterally" by referring to Parden,
without criticism, as standing for the "unremarkable, and
completely unrelated, proposition that the States may waive
their sovereign immunity," 517 U. S., at 65. In short, except
for those in today's majority, no member of this Court had
ever questioned the holding of Parden that the Court today
discards because it cannot find "merit in attempting to salvage any remnant of it." Ante, at 680.

Breyer, J., dissenting
Parden had never been questioned because, SeminoleTribe or not, it still makes sense. The line the Court today

rejects has been drawn by this Court to place States outsidethe ordinary dormant Commerce Clause rules when they act
as "market participants." White v. Massachusetts Council
of Constr. Employers, Inc., 460 U. S. 204, 206-208 (1983);Reeves, Inc. v. Stake, 447 U. S. 429, 434-439 (1980); Hughes v.

Alexandria Scrap Corp., 426 U. S. 794, 804-810 (1976). AndCongress has drawn this same line in the related context
of foreign state sovereign immunity. 28 U. S. C. $ 1605(a)(2).In doing so, Congress followed the modern trend, which
"spread rapidly after the Second World War," regarding for-eign state sovereign immunity. 1 Restatement (Third) of
Foreign Relations Law of the United States, ch. 5, Introduc-tory Note, p. 391 (1986) (recognizing that "immunity . . . gave
states an unfair advantage in competition with private com-mercial enterprise"); see also Report of the International
Law Commission on the Work of its Thirty-Eighth Session,Art. 11, || 1, p. 7 (United Nations Doc. A/41/498, Aug. 26,
1986) (when a State engages in a commercial contract with aforeign person, "the State is considered to have consented to
the exercise" of foreign jurisdiction in a proceeding arisingout of that contract). Indeed, given the widely accepted
view among modern nations that when a State engages inordinary commercial activity sovereign immunity has no
significant role to play, it is today's holding, not Parden,that creates the legal "anomaly."

II
I resist all the more strongly the Court's extension of
Seminole Tribe in this case because, although I accept thisCourt's pre-Seminole Tribe sovereign immunity decisions, I

am not yet ready to adhere to the proposition of law set forthin Seminole Tribe. Cf. EEOC v. Wyoming, 460 U. S. 226,
249-250 (1983) (Stevens, J., concurring). In my view, Con-gress does possess the authority to abrogate a State's sover527US2 Unit: $U90 [05-09-01 13:06:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Breyer, J., dissenting

eign immunity where "necessary and proper" to the exercise
of an Article I power. My reasons include those that Justices Stevens and Souter already have described in
detail.

(1) Neither constitutional text nor the surrounding debates
support Seminole Tribe's view that Congress lacks the Article I power to abrogate a State's sovereign immunity in
federal-question cases (unlike diversity cases). Seminole
Tribe, 517 U. S., at 82-83, and nn. 8, 9 (Stevens, J., dissenting); id., at 142-150 (Souter, J., dissenting); cf. the majority's characterization of this argument, ante, at 687-688.

(2) The precedents that offer important legal support for
the doctrine of sovereign immunity do not help the Seminole
Tribe majority. They all focus upon a critically different
question, namely, whether courts, acting without legislative
support, can abrogate state sovereign immunity, not whether
Congress, acting legislatively, can do so. See Principality
of Monaco v. Mississippi, 292 U. S. 313 (1934); Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U. S. 1 (1890); Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 419,
429 (1793) (Iredell, J., dissenting); Seminole Tribe, supra, at
119 (Souter, J., dissenting) ("Because no federal legislation
purporting to pierce state immunity was at issue, it cannot
fairly be said that Hans held state sovereign immunity to
have attained some constitutional status immunizing it
from abrogation").

(3) Sovereign immunity is a common-law doctrine. The
new American Nation received common-law doctrines selectively, accepting some, abandoning others, and frequently
modifying those it accepted in light of the new Nation's
special needs and circumstances. Seminole Tribe, supra, at
130-142 (Souter, J., dissenting). The new Nation's federalist lodestar, dual sovereignty (of State and Nation), demanded modification of the traditional single-sovereign immunity doctrine, thereby permitting Congress to narrow or
abolish state sovereign immunity where necessary.

527US2 Unit: $U90 [05-09-01 13:06:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN

701Cite as: 527 U. S. 666 (1999)
Breyer, J., dissenting
(a) Dual sovereignty undercuts the doctrine's traditional"logical and practical" justification, namely (in the words of

Justice Holmes), that "there can be no legal right as againstthe authority that makes the law on which the right depends." Kawananakoa v. Polyblank, 205 U. S. 349, 353
(1907). When a State is sued for violating federal law, the"authority" that would assert the immunity, the State, is not

the "authority" that made the (federal) law. This point re-mains true even if the Court treats sovereign immunity as a
principle of natural law. Alden v. Maine, post, at 762-764(

Souter, J., dissenting).

(b) Dual sovereignty, by granting Congress the power to
create substantive rights that bind States (despite their sovereignty) must grant Congress the subsidiary power to create related private remedies that bind States (despite their
sovereignty).

(c) Dual sovereignty means that Congress may need that
lesser power lest States (if they are not subject to federal
remedies) ignore the substantive federal law that binds
them, thereby disabling the National Government and weakening the very Union that the Constitution creates. Cf. McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 407-408 (1819); Cohens
v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 386-387 (1821).

(4) By interpreting the Constitution as rendering immutable this one common-law doctrine (sovereign immunity),
Seminole Tribe threatens the Nation's ability to enact economic legislation needed for the future in much the way that
Lochner v. New York, 198 U. S. 45 (1905), threatened the Nation's ability to enact social legislation over 90 years ago.

I shall elaborate upon this last-mentioned point. The similarity to Lochner lies in the risk that Seminole Tribe and
the Court's subsequent cases will deprive Congress of necessary legislative flexibility. Their rules will make it more difficult for Congress to create, for example, a decentralized
system of individual private remedies, say a private remedial
system needed to protect intellectual property, including

computer-related educational materials, irrespective of theneed for, or importance of, such a system in a 21st-century

advanced economy. Cf. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed.
Expense Bd. v. College Savings Bank, ante, at 656-660 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (illustrating the harm the rules work to
the patent system). Similarly, those rules will inhibit thecreation of innovative legal regimes, say, incentive-based or

decentralized regulatory systems, that deliberately take ac-count of local differences by assigning roles, powers, or responsibility, not just to federal administrators, but to citi-zens, at least if such a regime must incorporate a private
remedy against a State (e. g., a State as water polluter) to
work effectively. Yet, ironically, Congress needs this kind
of flexibility if it is to achieve one of federalism's basic
objectives.

That basic objective should not be confused with the details of any particular federalist doctrine, for the contours of
federalist doctrine have changed over the course of our Nation's history. Thomas Jefferson's purchase of Louisiana, for
example, reshaped the great debate about the need for a
broad, rather than a literal, interpretation of federal powers;
the Civil War effectively ended the claim of a State's right
to "nullify" a federal law; the Second New Deal, and its ultimate judicial ratification, showed that federal and state legislative authority were not mutually exclusive; this Court's
"civil rights" decisions clarified the protection against state
infringement that the Fourteenth Amendment offers to basic
human liberty. In each instance the content of specific federalist doctrines had to change to reflect the Nation's changing needs (territorial expansion, the end of slavery, the Great
Depression, and desegregation).

But those changing doctrines reflect at least one unchanging goal: the protection of liberty. Federalism helps to protect liberty not simply in our modern sense of helping the
individual remain free of restraints imposed by a distant government, but more directly by promoting the sharing among

Breyer, J., dissenting
citizens of governmental decisionmaking authority. See B.Constant, Political Writings 307 (B. Fontana transl. 1988) (describing the "Liberty of the Ancients Compared with that ofthe Moderns"). The ancient world understood the need to
divide sovereign power among a nation's citizens, thereby
creating government in which all would exercise that power;and they called "free" the citizens who exercised that power

so divided. Our Nation's Founders understood the same, forthey wrote a Constitution that divided governmental authority, that retained great power at state and local levels, andwhich foresaw, indeed assumed, democratic citizen participation in government at all levels, including levels that facilitated citizen participation closer to a citizen's home.

In today's world, legislative flexibility is necessary if we
are to protect this kind of liberty. Modern commerce and
the technology upon which it rests need large markets and
seek government large enough to secure trading rules that
permit industry to compete in the global marketplace, to prevent pollution that crosses borders, and to assure adequate
protection of health and safety by discouraging a regulatory
"race to the bottom." Yet local control over local decisions
remains necessary. Uniform regulatory decisions about, for
example, chemical waste disposal, pesticides, or food labeling, will directly affect daily life in every locality. But they
may reflect differing views among localities about the relative importance of the wage levels or environmental preferences that underlie them. Local control can take account of
such concerns and help to maintain a sense of community
despite global forces that threaten it. Federalism matters
to ordinary citizens seeking to maintain a degree of control,
a sense of community, in an increasingly interrelated and
complex world.

Courts can remain sensitive to these needs when they interpret statutes and apply constitutional provisions, for example, the dormant Commerce Clause. But courts cannot
easily draw the proper basic lines of authority. The proper

local/national/international balance is often highly contextspecific. And judicial rules that would allocate power are

often far too broad. Legislatures, however, can write lawsthat more specifically embody that balance. Specific regulatory schemes, for example, can draw lines that leave certain
local authority untouched, or that involve States, local com-munities, or citizens directly through the grant of funds,

powers, rights, or privileges. Depending upon context,Congress may encourage or require interaction among citizens working at various levels of government. That is whythe modern substantive federalist problem demands a flexible, context-specific legislative response (and it does not help
to constitutionalize an ahistoric view of sovereign immunity
that, by freezing its remedial limitations, tends to place the
State beyond the reach of law).

I recognize the possibility that Congress may achieve its
objectives in other ways. Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123
(1908), is still available, though effective only where damages
remedies are not important. Congress, too, might create
a federal damages-collecting "enforcement" bureaucracy
charged with responsibilities that Congress would prefer to
place in the hands of States or private citizens, Alden v.
Maine, post, at 755-756; Printz v. United States, 521 U. S.

898, 977 (1997) (Breyer, J., dissenting). Or perhaps Congress will be able to achieve the results it seeks (including decentralization) by embodying the necessary state
"waivers" in federal funding programs--in which case, the
Court's decisions simply impose upon Congress the burden
of rewriting legislation, for no apparent reason.

But none of these alternatives is satisfactory. Unfortunately, Seminole Tribe and today's related decisions separate
one formal strand from the federalist skein--a strand that
has been understood as antirepublican since the time of
Cicero--and they elevate that strand to the level of an immutable constitutional principle more akin to the thought of
James I than of James Madison. They do so when the role

sovereign immunity once played in helping to assure theStates that their political independence would remain even

after joining the Union no longer holds center stage. SeeNevada v. Hall, 440 U. S. 410, 418 (1979). They do so when
a federal court's ability to enforce its judgment against aState is no longer a major concern. See The Federalist
No. 81, p. 488 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton). And theydo so without adequate legal support grounded in either history or practical need. To the contrary, by making that doc-trine immune from congressional Article I modification, the
Court makes it more difficult for Congress to decentralizegovernmental decisionmaking and to provide individual citizens, or local communities, with a variety of enforcementpowers. By diminishing congressional flexibility to do so,
the Court makes it somewhat more difficult to satisfy mod-ern federalism's more important liberty-protecting needs.
In this sense, it is counterproductive.

I do not know whether the State has engaged in false ad-vertising or unfair competition as College Savings Bank alleges. But this case was dismissed at the threshold. Con-gress has clearly said that College Savings Bank may bring
a Lanham Act suit in these circumstances. For the reasonsset forth in this opinion, I believe Congress has the constitutional power so to provide. I would therefore reverse thejudgment of the Court of Appeals.

ALDEN et al. v. MAINE
certiorari to the supreme judicial court of maine

No. 98-436. Argued March 31, 1999--Decided June 23, 1999
After this Court decided, in Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S.

44, that Congress lacks power under Article I to abrogate the States'
sovereign immunity in federal court, the Federal District Court dismissed a Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 suit filed by petitioners
against their employer, respondent Maine. Subsequently, petitioners
filed the same action in state court. Although the FLSA purports to
authorize private actions against States in their own courts, the trial
court dismissed the suit on the ground of sovereign immunity. The
Maine Supreme Judicial Court affirmed.

Held:

1. The Constitution's structure and history and this Court's authoritative interpretations make clear that the States' immunity from suit is a
fundamental aspect of the sovereignty they enjoyed before the Constitution's ratification and retain today except as altered by the plan of the
Convention or certain constitutional Amendments. Under the federal
system established by the Constitution, the States retain a "residuary
and inviolable sovereignty." The Federalist No. 39, p. 245. They are
not relegated to the role of mere provinces or political corporations, but
retain the dignity, though not the full authority, of sovereignty. The
founding generation considered immunity from private suits central to
this dignity. The doctrine that a sovereign could not be sued without
its consent was universal in the States when the Constitution was
drafted and ratified. In addition, the leading advocates of the Constitution gave explicit assurances during the ratification debates that the
Constitution would not strip States of sovereign immunity. This was
also the understanding of those state conventions that addressed state
sovereign immunity in their ratification documents. When, just five
years after the Constitution's adoption, this Court held that Article III
authorized a private citizen of another State to sue Georgia without its
consent, Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 419, the Eleventh Amendment
was ratified. An examination of Chisholm indicates that the case, not
the Amendment, deviated from the original understanding, which was
to preserve States' traditional immunity from suit. The Amendment's
text and history also suggest that Congress acted not to change but to
restore the original constitutional design. Finally, the swiftness and
near unanimity with which the Amendment was adopted indicate that

527US2 Unit: $U91 [05-09-01 13:08:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Syllabus
the Court had not captured the original understanding. This Court's
subsequent decisions reflect a settled doctrinal understanding that sovereign immunity derives not from the Eleventh Amendment but from
the structure of the original Constitution. Since the Amendment confirmed rather than established sovereign immunity as a constitutional
principal, it follows that that immunity's scope is demarcated not by the
text of the Amendment alone but by fundamental postulates implicit in
the constitutional design. Pp. 712-730.

2. The States' immunity from private suit in their own courts
is beyond congressional power to abrogate by Article I legislation.
Pp. 730-754.

(a) Congress may exercise its Article I powers to subject States to
private suits in their own courts only if there is compelling evidence
that States were required to surrender this power to Congress pursuant
to the constitutional design. Blatchford v. Native Village of Noatak,
501 U. S. 775, 781. Pp. 730-731.

(b) Neither the Constitution's text nor the Court's recent sovereign
immunity decisions establish that States were required to relinquish
this portion of their sovereignty. Pp. 731-740.

(1) The Constitution, by delegating to Congress the power to establish the supreme law of the land when acting within its enumerated
powers, does not foreclose a State from asserting immunity to claims
arising under federal law merely because that law derives not from the
State itself but from the national power. See, e. g., Hans v. Louisiana,
134 U. S. 1. Moreover, the specific Article I powers delegated to Congress do not necessarily include the incidental authority to subject
States to private suits as a means of achieving objectives otherwise
within the enumerated powers' scope. Those decisions that have endorsed this contention, see, e. g., Parden v. Terminal R. Co. of Ala.
Docks Dept., 377 U. S. 184, 190-194, have been overruled, see, e. g., College Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd.,
ante, at 680. Pp. 731-735.

(2) Isolated statements in some of this Court's cases suggest that
the Eleventh Amendment is inapplicable in state courts. This is a truism as to the Amendment's literal terms. However, the Amendment's
bare text is not an exhaustive description of States' constitutional immunity, and the cases do not decide the question whether States retain
immunity in their own courts notwithstanding an attempted abrogation
by Congress. Pp. 735-740.

(c) Whether Congress has the authority under Article I to abrogate
a State's immunity in its own courts is, then, a question of first impression. History, practice, precedent, and the Constitution's structure

527US2 Unit: $U91 [05-09-01 13:08:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN
708 ALDEN v. MAINE

Syllabus
show no compelling evidence that this derogation of the States' sovereignty is inherent in the constitutional compact. Pp. 741-754.

(1) Turning first to evidence of the original understanding of the
Constitution: The Founders' silence regarding the States' immunity
from suit in their own courts, despite the controversy regarding state
sovereign immunity in federal court, suggests the sovereign's right to
assert immunity from suit in its own courts was so well established that
no one conceived the new Constitution would alter it. The arguments
raised for and against the Constitution during ratification confirm this
strong inference. Similarly, nothing in Chisholm, the catalyst for the
Eleventh Amendment, suggested the States were not immune from
suits in their own courts. The Amendment's language, furthermore,
was directed toward Article III, the only constitutional provision believed to call state sovereign immunity into question; and nothing in
that Article or in any other part of the Constitution suggested the
States could not assert immunity in their own courts or that Congress
had the power to abrogate such immunity. Finally, implicit in a proposal rejected by Congress--which would have limited the Amendment's scope to cases where States had made available a remedy in their
own courts--was the premise that States retained their immunity and
the concomitant authority to decide whether to allow private suits
against the sovereign in their own courts. Pp. 741-743.

(2) The historical analysis is supported by early congressional
practice. Early Congresses enacted no statutes purporting to authorize suits against nonconsenting States in state court, and statutes purporting to authorize such suits in any forum are all but absent from the
Nation's historical experience. Even recent statutes provide no evidence of an understanding that Congress has a greater power to subject
States to suit in their own courts than in federal courts. Pp. 743-745.

(3) The theory and reasoning of this Court's earlier cases also
suggest that States retain constitutional immunity from suit in their
own courts. The States' immunity has been described in sweeping
terms, without reference to whether a suit was prosecuted in state or
federal court. See, e. g., Briscoe v. Bank of Kentucky, 11 Pet. 257, 321-
322. The Court has said on many occasions that the States retain their
immunity in their own courts, see, e. g., Beers v. Arkansas, 20 How. 527,
529, and has relied on that as a premise in its Eleventh Amendment
rulings, see, e. g., Hans v. Louisiana, supra, at 10. Pp. 745-748.

(4) A review of the essential principles of federalism and the
state courts' special role in the constitutional design leads to the conclusion that a congressional power to subject nonconsenting States to private suits in their own courts is inconsistent with the Constitution's
structure.

Syllabus
Federalism requires that Congress accord States the respect
and dignity due them as residuary sovereigns and joint participants in
the Nation's governance. Immunity from suit in federal courts is not
enough to preserve that dignity, for the indignity of subjecting a nonconsenting State to the coercive process of judicial tribunals at the instance
of private parties exists regardless of the forum. In some ways, a congressional power to authorize suits against States in their own courts
would be even more offensive to state sovereignty than a power to authorize suits in a federal forum, since a sovereign's immunity in its own
courts has always been understood to be within the sole control of the
sovereign itself. Further, because the Federal Government retains its
own immunity from suit in state and federal court, this Court is reluctant to conclude that States are not entitled to a reciprocal privilege.
Underlying constitutional form are considerations of great substance.
Private suits against nonconsenting States may threaten their financial
integrity, and the surrender of immunity carries with it substantial costs
to the autonomy, decisionmaking ability, and sovereign capacity of the
States. A general federal power to authorize private suits for money
damages would also strain States' ability to govern in accordance with
their citizens' will, for judgment creditors compete with other important
needs and worthwhile ends for access to the public fisc, necessitating
difficult decisions involving the most sensitive and political of judgments. A national power to remove these decisions regarding the allocation of scarce resources from the political processes established by the
citizens of the States and commit their resolution to judicial decrees
mandated by the Federal Government and invoked by the private citizen would blur not only the State and National Governments' distinct
responsibilities but also the separate duties of the state governments'
judicial and political branches.

Congress cannot abrogate States' sovereign immunity in federal court; were the rule different here, the National Government would
wield greater power in state courts than in federal courts. This anomaly cannot be explained by reference to the state courts' special role in
the constitutional design. It would be unprecedented to infer from the
fact that Congress may declare federal law binding and enforceable in
state courts the further principle that Congress' authority to pursue
federal objectives through state courts exceeds not only its power to
press other branches of the State into its service but also its control over
federal courts. The constitutional provisions upon which this Court has
relied in finding state courts peculiarly amendable to federal command,
moreover, do not distinguish those courts from the Federal Judiciary.
No constitutional precept would admit of a congressional power to require state courts to entertain federal suits which are not within the

Syllabus
United States' judicial power and could not be heard in federal courts.
Pp. 748-754.

3. A State's constitutional privilege to assert its sovereign immunity
in its own courts does not confer upon the State a concomitant right to
disregard the Constitution or valid federal law. States and their officers are bound by obligations imposed by the Constitution and federal
statutes that comport with the constitutional design. Limits implicit
in the constitutional principle of sovereign immunity strike the proper
balance between the supremacy of federal law and the separate sovereignty of the States. The first limit is that sovereign immunity bars
suits only in the absence of consent. Many States have enacted statutes consenting to suits and have consented to some suits pursuant to
the plan of the Convention or to subsequent constitutional Amendments.
The second important limit is that sovereign immunity bars suits
against States but not against lesser entities, such as municipal corporations, or against a state officer for injunctive or declaratory relief or for
money damages to be collected not from the state treasury but from the
officer personally. Pp. 754-757.

4. Maine has not waived its immunity. It adheres to the general rule
that a specific legislative enactment is required to waive sovereign immunity. Although petitioners contend that Maine discriminated against
federal rights by claiming immunity from this suit, there is no evidence
that it has manipulated its immunity in a systematic fashion to discriminate against federal causes of action. To the extent Maine has chosen
to consent to certain classes of suits while maintaining its immunity
from others, it has done no more than exercise a privilege of sovereignty. Pp. 757-758.

the suit was pending, this Court decided Seminole Tribe ofFla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44 (1996), which made it clear that
Congress lacks power under Article I to abrogate the States'sovereign immunity from suits commenced or prosecuted in
the federal courts. Upon consideration of Seminole Tribe,the District Court dismissed petitioners' action, and the
Court of Appeals affirmed. Mills v. Maine, 118 F. 3d 37(CA1 1997). Petitioners then filed the same action in state
court. The state trial court dismissed the suit on the basisof sovereign immunity, and the Maine Supreme Judicial
Court affirmed. 715 A. 2d 172 (1998).The Maine Supreme Judicial Court's decision conflicts with
the decision of the Supreme Court of Arkansas, Jacoby v.Arkansas Dept. of Ed., 331 Ark. 508, 962 S. W. 2d 773 (1998),
and calls into question the constitutionality of the provisionsof the FLSA purporting to authorize private actions against

question presented and the conflict between the courts, wegranted certiorari. 525 U. S. 981 (1998). The United States

Const., Amdt. 11. We have, as a result, sometimes referredto the States' immunity from suit as "Eleventh Amendment

immunity." The phrase is convenient shorthand but some-thing of a misnomer, for the sovereign immunity of the
States neither derives from, nor is limited by, the terms ofthe Eleventh Amendment. Rather, as the Constitution's
structure, its history, and the authoritative interpretationsby this Court make clear, the States' immunity from suit is
a fundamental aspect of the sovereignty which the Statesenjoyed before the ratification of the Constitution, and which
they retain today (either literally or by virtue of their admis-sion into the Union upon an equal footing with the other
States) except as altered by the plan of the Convention orcertain constitutional Amendments.

A
Although the Constitution establishes a National Govern-ment with broad, often plenary authority over matters

within its recognized competence, the founding document"specifically recognizes the States as sovereign entities."
Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, supra, at 71, n. 15; accord,Blatchford v. Native Village of Noatak, 501 U. S. 775, 779
(1991) ("[T]he States entered the federal system with theirsovereignty intact"). Various textual provisions of the Constitution assume the States' continued existence and activeparticipation in the fundamental processes of governance.
See Printz v. United States, 521 U. S. 898, 919 (1997) (citingArt. III, $ 2; Art. IV, $$ 2-4; Art. V). The limited and enumerated powers granted to the Legislative, Executive, andJudicial Branches of the National Government, moreover,
underscore the vital role reserved to the States by the con-stitutional design, see, e. g., Art. I, $ 8; Art. II, $$ 2-3; Art.
III, $ 2. Any doubt regarding the constitutional role of theStates as sovereign entities is removed by the Tenth Amendment, which, like the other provisions of the Bill of Rights,was enacted to allay lingering concerns about the extent of

Opinion of the Court
the national power. The Amendment confirms the promise
implicit in the original document: "The powers not delegated
to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by
it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or
to the people." U. S. Const., Amdt. 10; see also Printz,
supra, at 919; New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144, 156-
159, 177 (1992).

The federal system established by our Constitution preserves the sovereign status of the States in two ways.
First, it reserves to them a substantial portion of the Nation's primary sovereignty, together with the dignity and essential attributes inhering in that status. The States "form
distinct and independent portions of the supremacy, no more
subject, within their respective spheres, to the general authority than the general authority is subject to them, within
its own sphere." The Federalist No. 39, p. 245 (C. Rossiter
ed. 1961) (J. Madison).

Second, even as to matters within the competence of the
National Government, the constitutional design secures the
founding generation's rejection of "the concept of a central
government that would act upon and through the States" in
favor of "a system in which the State and Federal Governments would exercise concurrent authority over the people--
who were, in Hamilton's words, `the only proper objects of
government.' " Printz, supra, at 919-920 (quoting The Federalist No. 15, at 109); accord, New York, supra, at 166 ("The
Framers explicitly chose a Constitution that confers upon
Congress the power to regulate individuals, not States").
In this the Founders achieved a deliberate departure from
the Articles of Confederation: Experience under the Articles
had "exploded on all hands" the "practicality of making laws,
with coercive sanctions, for the States as political bodies."

The States thus retain "a residuary and inviolable sover-eignty." The Federalist No. 39, at 245. They are not relegated to the role of mere provinces or political corporations,but retain the dignity, though not the full authority, of
sovereignty. B

The generation that designed and adopted our federal sys-tem considered immunity from private suits central to sovereign dignity. When the Constitution was ratified, it waswell established in English law that the Crown could not be
sued without consent in its own courts. See Chisholm v.
Georgia, 2 Dall. 419, 437-446 (1793) (Iredell, J., dissenting)(surveying English practice); cf.

Nevada v. Hall, 440 U. S.410, 414 (1979) ("The immunity of a truly independent sovereign from suit in its own courts has been enjoyed as a matterof absolute right for centuries. Only the sovereign's own
consent could qualify the absolute character of that immu-nity"). In reciting the prerogatives of the Crown, Blackstone--whose works constituted the preeminent authority onEnglish law for the founding generation--underscored the
close and necessary relationship understood to exist betweensovereignty and immunity from suit:

"And, first, the law ascribes to the king the attribute ofsovereignty, or pre-eminence. . . . Hence it is, that no
suit or action can be brought against the king, even incivil matters, because no court can have jurisdiction
over him. For all jurisdiction implies superiority ofpower . . . ." 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the
Laws of England 234-235 (1765).
Although the American people had rejected other aspectsof English political theory, the doctrine that a sovereign

could not be sued without its consent was universal in the

Opinion of the Court
States when the Constitution was drafted and ratified. SeeChisholm, supra, at 434-435 (Iredell, J., dissenting) ("I believe there is no doubt that neither in the State now in ques-tion, nor in any other in the Union, any particular Legislative mode, authorizing a compulsory suit for the recovery ofmoney against a State, was in being either when the Constitution was adopted, or at the time the judicial act waspassed");

Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U. S. 1, 16 (1890) ("The su-ability of a State, without its consent, was a thing unknown

to the law. This has been so often laid down and acknowl-edged by courts and jurists that it is hardly necessary to be
formally asserted").The ratification debates, furthermore, underscored the importance of the States' sovereign immunity to the Americanpeople. Grave concerns were raised by the provisions of
Article III, which extended the federal judicial power tocontroversies between States and citizens of other States or

foreign nations. As we have explained:

"Unquestionably the doctrine of sovereign immunitywas a matter of importance in the early days of independence. Many of the States were heavily indebted asa result of the Revolutionary War. They were vitally
interested in the question whether the creation of a newfederal sovereign, with courts of its own, would automatically subject them, like lower English lords, to suitsin the courts of the `higher' sovereign."

Hall, supra, at418 (footnote omitted).

The leading advocates of the Constitution assured the peo-ple in no uncertain terms that the Constitution would not
strip the States of sovereign immunity. One assurance wascontained in The Federalist No. 81, written by Alexander
Hamilton:

"It is inherent in the nature of sovereignty not to beamenable to the suit of an individual

without its consent.This is the general sense and the general practice of

mankind; and the exemption, as one of the attributes ofsovereignty, is now enjoyed by the government of every

State in the Union. Unless, therefore, there is a surren-der of this immunity in the plan of the convention, it will
remain with the States and the danger intimated must
be merely ideal. . . . [T]here is no color to pretend thatthe State governments would, by the adoption of that

plan, be divested of the privilege of paying their owndebts in their own way, free from every constraint but
that which flows from the obligations of good faith. Thecontracts between a nation and individuals are only
binding on the conscience of the sovereign, and have nopretensions to a compulsive force. They confer no right
of action independent of the sovereign will. To what
purpose would it be to authorize suits against States forthe debts they owe? How could recoveries be enforced?

It is evident that it could not be done without wagingwar against the contracting State; and to ascribe to the
federal courts, by mere implication, and in destructionof a preexisting right of the State governments, a power
which would involve such a consequence, would be alto-gether forced and unwarrantable."

Id., at 487-488 (emphasis in original).

At the Virginia ratifying convention, James Madison echoed
this theme:

"Its jurisdiction in controversies between a state and
citizens of another state is much objected to, and per-haps without reason. It is not in the power of individuals to call any state into court. . . .

". . . It appears to me that this [clause] can have no
operation but this--to give a citizen a right to be heard
in the federal courts; and if a state should condescend
to be a party, this court may take cognizance of it." 3

ed. 1854) (hereinafter Elliot's Debates).

718 ALDEN v. MAINE

Opinion of the Court
When Madison's explanation was questioned, John Marshallprovided immediate support:

"With respect to disputes between a state and the citizens of another state, its jurisdiction has been decried
with unusual vehemence. I hope no gentleman willthink that a state will be called at the bar of the federal

court. Is there no such case at present? Are there notmany cases in which the legislature of Virginia is a
party, and yet the state is not sued? It is not rationalto suppose that the sovereign power should be dragged
before a court. The intent is, to enable states to recover claims of individuals residing in other states. Icontend this construction is warranted by the words.

But, say they, there will be partiality in it if a statecannot be defendant . . . . It is necessary to be so, and

cannot be avoided. I see a difficulty in making a statedefendant, which does not prevent its being plaintiff."
3 id., at 555-556 (emphasis in original).
Although the state conventions which addressed the issue
of sovereign immunity in their formal ratification documentssought to clarify the point by constitutional amendment, they

made clear that they, like Hamilton, Madison, and Marshall,understood the Constitution as drafted to preserve the
States' immunity from private suits. The Rhode Island
Convention thus proclaimed that "[i]t is declared by the Con-vention, that the judicial power of the United States, in cases

in which a state may be a party, does not extend to criminalprosecutions, or to authorize any suit by any person against
a state." 1 id., at 336. The convention sought, in addition,
an express amendment "to remove all doubts or controversies respecting the same." Ibid. In a similar fashion, the
New York Convention "declare[d] and ma[d]e known," 1 id.,
at 327, its understanding "[t]hat the judicial power of the
United States, in cases in which a state may be a party, does
not extend to criminal prosecutions, or to authorize any suit

Opinion of the Court
by any person against a state," 1 id., at 329. The conventionproceeded to ratify the Constitution "[u]nder these impressions, and declaring that the rights aforesaid cannot beabridged or violated, and that the explanations aforesaid are
consistent with the said Constitution, and in confidence that
the amendments which shall have been proposed to the saidConstitution will receive an early and mature consideration." Ibid.Despite the persuasive assurances of the Constitution's
leading advocates and the expressed understanding of theonly state conventions to address the issue in explicit terms,
this Court held, just five years after the Constitution was
adopted, that Article III authorized a private citizen of another State to sue the State of Georgia without its consent.
Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 419 (1793). Each of the four
Justices who concurred in the judgment issued a separate
opinion. The common theme of the opinions was that the
case fell within the literal text of Article III, which by its
terms granted jurisdiction over controversies "between a
State and Citizens of another State," and "between a State,
or the Citizens thereof, and foreign States, Citizens, or Subjects." U. S. Const., Art. III, $ 2. The argument that this
provision granted jurisdiction only over cases in which the
State was a plaintiff was dismissed as inconsistent with the
ordinary meaning of "between," and with the provision extending jurisdiction to "Controversies between two or more
States," which by necessity contemplated jurisdiction over
suits to which States were defendants. Two Justices also
argued that sovereign immunity was inconsistent with the
principle of popular sovereignty established by the Constitution, 2 Dall., at 454-458 (Wilson, J.); id., at 470-472 (Jay,
C. J.); although the others did not go so far, they contended
that the text of Article III evidenced the States' surrender
of sovereign immunity as to those provisions extending jurisdiction over suits to which States were parties, id., at 452
(Blair, J.); id., at 468 (Cushing, J.).

Opinion of the Court
Justice Iredell dissented, relying on American history, id.,at 434-435, English history,

id., at 437-446, and the principles of enumerated powers and separate sovereignty, id., at435-436, 448, 449-450. See generally

Hans, 134 U. S., at 12
("The other justices were more swayed by a close observance
of the letter of the Constitution, without regard to formerexperience and usage . . . . Justice Iredell, on the contrary,

contended that it was not the intention to create new andunheard of remedies, by subjecting sovereign States to actions at the suit of individuals, (which he conclusively showedwas never done before,) but only . . . to invest the federal
courts with jurisdiction to hear and determine controversies
and cases, between the parties designated, that were properly susceptible of litigation in courts").

The Court's decision "fell upon the country with a profound shock." 1 C. Warren, The Supreme Court in United
States History 96 (rev. ed. 1926); accord, Hans, supra, at 11;
Principality of Monaco v. Mississippi, 292 U. S. 313, 325
(1934); Seminole Tribe, 517 U. S., at 69. "Newspapers representing a rainbow of opinion protested what they viewed
as an unexpected blow to state sovereignty. Others spoke
more concretely of prospective raids on state treasuries."
D. Currie, The Constitution in Congress: The Federalist Period 1789-1801, p. 196 (1997).

The States, in particular, responded with outrage to the
decision. The Massachusetts Legislature, for example, denounced the decision as "repugnant to the first principles of
a federal government," and called upon the Commonwealth's
Senators and Representatives to take all necessary steps to
"remove any clause or article of the . . . Constitution, which
can be construed to imply or justify a decision, that, a State
is compellable to answer in any suit by an individual or individuals in any Court of the United States." 15 Papers of
Alexander Hamilton 314 (H. Syrett & J. Cooke eds. 1969)
(internal quotation marks omitted). Georgia's response was
more intemperate: Its House of Representatives passed a bill

527US2 Unit: $U91 [05-09-01 13:08:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
providing that anyone attempting to enforce the Chisholmdecision would be " `guilty of felony and shall suffer death,

without benefit of clergy, by being hanged.' " Currie, supra,at 196.

An initial proposal to amend the Constitution was introduced in the House of Representatives the day after Chisholm was announced; the proposal adopted as the Eleventh
Amendment was introduced in the Senate promptly follow-ing an intervening recess. Currie,

supra, at 196. Congress
turned to the latter proposal with great dispatch; little morethan two months after its introduction it had been endorsed

by both Houses and forwarded to the States. 4 Annals of
Congress 25, 30, 477, 499 (1794); 1 Stat. 402.

Each House spent but a single day discussing the Amendment, and the vote in each House was close to unanimous.
See 4 Annals of Congress, at 30-31, 476-478 (the Senate divided 23 to 2; the House 81 to 9). All attempts to weaken
the Amendment were defeated. Congress in succession rejected proposals to limit the Amendment to suits in which
" `the cause of action shall have arisen before the ratification
of the amendment,' " or even to cases " `where such State
shall have previously made provision in their own Courts,
whereby such suit may be prosecuted to effect' "; it refused
as well to make an exception for " `cases arising under treaties made under the authority of the United States.' " 4 id.,
at 30, 476.

It might be argued that the Chisholm decision was a correct interpretation of the constitutional design and that the
Eleventh Amendment represented a deviation from the original understanding. This, however, seems unsupportable.
First, despite the opinion of Justice Iredell, the majority
failed to address either the practice or the understanding
that prevailed in the States at the time the Constitution was
adopted. Second, even a casual reading of the opinions suggests the majority suspected the decision would be unpopular and surprising. See, e. g., 2 Dall., at 454-455 (Wilson, J.)

Opinion of the Court
(condemning the prevailing conception of sovereignty); id.,at 468 (Cushing, J.) ("If the Constitution is found inconvenient in practice in this or any other particular, it is well thata regular mode is pointed out for amendment");

id., at 478-
479 (Jay, C. J.) ("[T]here is reason to hope that the people of
[Georgia] will yet perceive that [sovereign immunity] wouldnot have been consistent with [republican] equality"); cf.

id.,
at 419-420 (attorney for Chisholm) ("I did not want the re-monstrance of

Georgia, to satisfy me, that the motion, which
I have made is unpopular. Before that remonstrance wasread, I had learnt from the acts of another State, whose will

must be always dear to me, that she too condemned it"). Finally, two Members of the majority acknowledged that the
United States might well remain immune from suit despite
Article III's grant of jurisdiction over "Controversies to
which the United States shall be a Party," see id., at 469
(Cushing, J.); id., at 478 (Jay, C. J.), and, invoking the example
of actions to collect debts incurred before the Constitution
was adopted, one raised the possibility of "exceptions," suggesting the rule of the case might not "extend to all the demands, and to every kind of action," id., at 479 (Jay, C. J.).
These concessions undercut the crucial premise that either
the Constitution's literal text or the principle of popular
sovereignty necessarily overrode widespread practice and
opinion.

The text and history of the Eleventh Amendment also suggest that Congress acted not to change but to restore the
original constitutional design. Although earlier drafts of
the Amendment had been phrased as express limits on the
judicial power granted in Article III, see, e. g., 3 Annals of
Congress 651-652 (1793) ("The Judicial Power of the United
States shall not extend to any suits in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States . . ."),
the adopted text addressed the proper interpretation of that
provision of the original Constitution, see U. S. Const.,
Amdt. 11 ("The Judicial power of the United States shall not

527US2 Unit: $U91 [05-09-01 13:08:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN

723Cite as: 527 U. S. 706 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, com-menced or prosecuted against one of the United States . . .").

By its terms, then, the Eleventh Amendment did not rede-fine the federal judicial power but instead overruled the
Court:

"This amendment, expressing the will of the ultimatesovereignty of the whole country, superior to all legislatures and all courts, actually reversed the decision ofthe Supreme Court. It did not in terms prohibit suits
by individuals against the States, but declared that theConstitution should not be construed to import any
power to authorize the bringing of such suits. . . . TheSupreme Court had construed the judicial power as extending to such a suit, and its decision was thus over-ruled."

Hans, 134 U. S., at 11.

The text reflects the historical context and the congres-sional objective in endorsing the Amendment for ratification.

Congress chose not to enact language codifying the tradi-tional understanding of sovereign immunity but rather to address the specific provisions of the Constitution that hadraised concerns during the ratification debates and formed
the basis of the Chisholm decision. Cf. 15 Papers of Alexan-der Hamilton, at 314 (quoted

supra, at 720). Given the out-raged reaction to Chisholm, as well as Congress' repeated

refusal to otherwise qualify the text of the Amendment, it isdoubtful that if Congress meant to write a new immunity
into the Constitution it would have limited that immunity tothe narrow text of the Eleventh Amendment:

"Can we suppose that, when the Eleventh Amendmentwas adopted, it was understood to be left open for citizens of a State to sue their own state in the federalcourts, whilst the idea of suits by citizens of other states,
or of foreign states, was indignantly repelled? Supposethat Congress, when proposing the Eleventh Amendment, had appended to it a proviso that nothing therein

527US2 Unit: $U91 [05-09-01 13:08:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN
724 ALDEN v. MAINE

Opinion of the Court
contained should prevent a State from being sued by itsown citizens in cases arising under the Constitution or

laws of the United States: can we imagine that it wouldhave been adopted by the States? The supposition that
it would is almost an absurdity on its face." Hans,
supra, at 14-15.

The more natural inference is that the Constitution was un-derstood, in light of its history and structure, to preserve

the States' traditional immunity from private suits. As theAmendment clarified the only provisions of the Constitution
that anyone had suggested might support a contrary under-standing, there was no reason to draft with a broader brush.

Finally, the swiftness and near unanimity with which theEleventh Amendment was adopted suggest "either that the
Court had not captured the original understanding, or thatthe country had changed its collective mind most rapidly."
D. Currie, The Constitution in the Supreme Court: The FirstHundred Years: 1789-1888, p. 18, n. 101 (1985). The more
reasonable interpretation, of course, is that regardless of theviews of four Justices in Chisholm, the country as a whole--
which had adopted the Constitution just five years earlier--had not understood the document to strip the States of their
immunity from private suits. Cf. Currie, The Constitutionin Congress, at 196 ("It is plain that just about everybody

in Congress agreed the Supreme Court had misread theConstitution").

Although the dissent attempts to rewrite history to reflecta different original understanding, its evidence is unpersuasive. The handful of state statutory and constitutional pro-visions authorizing suits or petitions of right against States
only confirms the prevalence of the traditional understandingthat a State could not be sued in the absence of an express
waiver, for if the understanding were otherwise, the pro-visions would have been unnecessary. The constitutional
amendments proposed by the New York and Rhode IslandConventions undercut rather than support the dissent's view

527US2 Unit: $U91 [05-09-01 13:08:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN

725Cite as: 527 U. S. 706 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
of history, see supra, at 718-719, and the amendments pro-posed by the Virginia and North Carolina Conventions do

not cast light upon the original understanding of the States'immunity to suit. It is true that, in the course of all but
eliminating federal-question and diversity jurisdiction, see 3
Elliot's Debates 660-661 (amendment proposed by the Vir-ginia Convention limiting the federal-question jurisdiction to

suits arising under treaties and the diversity jurisdiction tosuits between parties claiming lands under grants from different States); 4 id., at 246 (identical amendment proposedby the North Carolina Convention), the amendments would
have removed the language in the Constitution relied upon
by the Chisholm Court. While the amendments do reflect
dissatisfaction with the scope of federal jurisdiction as a general matter, there is no evidence that they were directed
toward the question of sovereign immunity or that they reflect an understanding that the States would be subject to
private suits without consent under Article III as drafted.

The dissent's remaining evidence cannot bear the weight
the dissent seeks to place on it. The views voiced during
the ratification debates by Edmund Randolph and James Wilson, when reiterated by the same individuals in their respective capacities as advocate and Justice in Chisholm, were
decisively rejected by the Eleventh Amendment, and General Pinkney did not speak to the issue of sovereign immunity at all. Furthermore, Randolph appears to have recognized that his views were in tension with the traditional
understanding of sovereign immunity, see 3 Elliot's Debates
573 ("I think, whatever the law of nations may say, that

any doubt respecting the construction that a state may be
plaintiff, and not defendant, is taken away by the words
where a state shall be a party"), and Wilson and Pinkney
expressed a radical nationalist vision of the constitutional
design that not only deviated from the views that prevailed
at the time but, despite the dissent's apparent embrace of
the position, remains startling even today, see post, at 776

Opinion of the Court
(quoting with approval Wilson's statement that " `the govern-ment of each state ought to be subordinate to the government of the United States' "). Nor do the controversialearly suits prosecuted against Maryland and New York reflect a widespread understanding that the States had surrendered their immunity to suit. Maryland's decision to submitto process in

Vanstophorst v. Maryland, 2 Dall. 401 (1791),
aroused great controversy, see Marcus & Wexler, SuitsAgainst States: Diversity of Opinion in the 1790s, 1993 J.

Sup. Ct. History 73, 74-75, and did not go unnoticed by theSupreme Court, see

Chisholm, 2 Dall., at 429-430 (Iredell,
J., dissenting). In Oswald v. New York, the State refused to
respond to the plaintiff 's summons until after the decision in
Chisholm had been announced; even then it at first asserted
the defense that it was "a free, sovereign and independent
State," and could not be "drawn or compelled" to defend the
suit. Marcus & Wexler, supra, at 76-77 (internal quotation
marks omitted). And, though the Court's decision in Chisholm may have had "champions `every bit as vigorous in defending their interpretation of the Constitution as were
those partisans on the other side of the issue,' " post, at 794,
the vote on the Eleventh Amendment makes clear that they
were decidedly less numerous. See supra, at 721.

In short, the scanty and equivocal evidence offered by the
dissent establishes no more than what is evident from the
decision in Chisholm--that some members of the founding
generation disagreed with Hamilton, Madison, Marshall, Iredell, and the only state conventions formally to address the
matter. The events leading to the adoption of the Eleventh
Amendment, however, make clear that the individuals who
believed the Constitution stripped the States of their immunity from suit were at most a small minority.

Not only do the ratification debates and the events leading
to the adoption of the Eleventh Amendment reveal the original understanding of the States' constitutional immunity
from suit; they also underscore the importance of sovereign

immunity to the founding generation. Simply put, "The
Constitution never would have been ratified if the States and
their courts were to be stripped of their sovereign authority
except as expressly provided by the Constitution itself."

(1985); accord, Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U. S. 651, 660 (1974).

C
The Court has been consistent in interpreting the adoption
of the Eleventh Amendment as conclusive evidence "that the
decision in Chisholm was contrary to the well-understood
meaning of the Constitution," Seminole Tribe, 517 U. S., at
69, and that the views expressed by Hamilton, Madison, and
Marshall during the ratification debates, and by Justice Iredell in his dissenting opinion in Chisholm, reflect the original
understanding of the Constitution. See, e. g., Hans, 134
U. S., at 12, 14-15, 18-19; Principality of Monaco, 292 U. S.,
at 325; Edelman, supra, at 660, n. 9; Seminole Tribe, supra,
at 70, and nn. 12-13. In accordance with this understanding,
we have recognized a "presumption that no anomalous and
unheard-of proceedings or suits were intended to be raised
up by the Constitution--anomalous and unheard of when the
constitution was adopted." Hans, 134 U. S., at 18; accord,
id., at 15. As a consequence, we have looked to "history and
experience, and the established order of things," id., at 14,
rather than "[a]dhering to the mere letter" of the Eleventh
Amendment, id., at 13, in determining the scope of the
States' constitutional immunity from suit.

Following this approach, the Court has upheld States' assertions of sovereign immunity in various contexts falling
outside the literal text of the Eleventh Amendment. In
Hans, the Court held that sovereign immunity barred a citizen from suing his own State under the federal-question
head of jurisdiction. The Court was unmoved by the petitioner's argument that the Eleventh Amendment, by its

527US2 Unit: $U91 [05-09-01 13:08:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
terms, applied only to suits brought by citizens of otherStates:

"It seems to us that these views of those great advo-cates and defenders of the Constitution were most sensible and just; and they apply equally to the present caseas to that then under discussion. The letter is appealed
to now, as it was then, as a ground for sustaining a suitbrought by an individual against a State. The reason
against it is as strong in this case as it was in that. Itis an attempt to strain the Constitution and the law to
a construction never imagined or dreamed of." Id., at
14-15.

Later decisions rejected similar requests to conform theprinciple of sovereign immunity to the strict language of the

Eleventh Amendment in holding that nonconsenting States
are immune from suits brought by federal corporations,
Smith v. Reeves, 178 U. S. 436 (1900), foreign nations, Principality of Monaco, supra, or Indian tribes, Blatchford v. Native Village of Noatak, 501 U. S. 775 (1991), and in concluding
that sovereign immunity is a defense to suits in admiralty,though the text of the Eleventh Amendment addresses only

suits "in law or equity," Ex parte New York, 256 U. S. 490(1921).

These holdings reflect a settled doctrinal understanding,
consistent with the views of the leading advocates of theConstitution's ratification, that sovereign immunity derives

not from the Eleventh Amendment but from the structureof the original Constitution itself. See,

e. g., Idaho v. Coeur
d'Alene Tribe of Idaho, 521 U. S. 261, 267-268 (1997) (acknowledging "the broader concept of immunity, implicit in
the Constitution, which we have regarded the Eleventh
Amendment as evidencing and exemplifying"); Seminole
Tribe, supra, at 55-56; Pennhurst State School and Hospital
v. Halderman, 465 U. S. 89, 98-99 (1984); Ex parte New York,
supra, at 497. The Eleventh Amendment confirmed, rather

Opinion of the Court
than established, sovereign immunity as a constitutional
principle; it follows that the scope of the States' immunity
from suit is demarcated not by the text of the Amendment
alone but by fundamental postulates implicit in the constitutional design. As we explained in Principality of Monaco:

"Manifestly, we cannot rest with a mere literal application of the words of $ 2 of Article III, or assume that
the letter of the Eleventh Amendment exhausts the
restrictions upon suits against non-consenting States.
Behind the words of the constitutional provisions are
postulates which limit and control. There is the essential postulate that the controversies, as contemplated,
shall be found to be of a justiciable character. There is
also the postulate that States of the Union, still possessing attributes of sovereignty, shall be immune from
suits, without their consent, save where there has been
`a surrender of this immunity in the plan of the convention.' " 292 U. S., at 322-323 (quoting The Federalist
No. 81 (footnote omitted).

Or, as we have more recently reaffirmed:

"Although the text of the Amendment would appear

to restrict only the Article III diversity jurisdiction of

the federal courts, `we have understood the Eleventh
Amendment to stand not so much for what it says, but
for the presupposition . . . which it confirms.' Blatchford v. Native Village of Noatak, 501 U. S. 775, 779

(1991). That presupposition, first observed over a century ago in Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U. S. 1 (1890), has
two parts: first, that each State is a sovereign entity in
our federal system; and second, that ` "[i]t is inherent in
the nature of sovereignty not to be amenable to the suit
of an individual without its consent," ' id., at 13 (emphasis deleted), quoting The Federalist No. 81, p. 487 . . . ."

sovereign immunity"). II

In this case we must determine whether Congress has thepower, under Article I, to subject nonconsenting States to
private suits in their own courts. As the foregoing discus-sion makes clear, the fact that the Eleventh Amendment by
its terms limits only "[t]he Judicial power of the UnitedStates" does not resolve the question. To rest on the words
of the Amendment alone would be to engage in the type ofahistorical literalism we have rejected in interpreting the
scope of the States' sovereign immunity since the discrediteddecision in

Chisholm. Seminole Tribe, 517 U. S., at 68; seealso
id., at 69 (quoting Principality of Monaco, supra, at326, in turn quoting Hans, 134 U. S., at 15) ("[W]e long have

recognized that blind reliance upon the text of the EleventhAmendment is ` "to strain the Constitution and the law to a
construction never imagined or dreamed of " ' ").While the constitutional principle of sovereign immunity
does pose a bar to federal jurisdiction over suits againstnonconsenting States, see,

e. g., Principality of Monaco,292 U. S., at 322-323, this is not the only structural basis of

sovereign immunity implicit in the constitutional design.Rather, "[t]here is also the postulate that States of the
Union, still possessing attributes of sovereignty, shall be im-mune from suits, without their consent, save where there
has been `a surrender of this immunity in the plan of theconvention.' "

Ibid. (quoting The Federalist No. 81; accord,Blatchford, supra, at 781; Seminole Tribe, supra, at 68.

This separate and distinct structural principle is not directlyrelated to the scope of the judicial power established by Article III, but inheres in the system of federalism establishedby the Constitution. In exercising its Article I powers Con527US2 Unit: $U91 [05-09-01 13:08:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Article I, $ 8, grants, Congress broad power to enact legis-lation in several enumerated areas of national concern. The

Supremacy Clause, furthermore, provides:

"This Constitution, and the Laws of the United Stateswhich shall be made in Pursuance thereof . . . , shall be

the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in everyState shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstand-ing." U. S. Const., Art. VI.

It is contended that, by virtue of these provisions, whereCongress enacts legislation subjecting the States to suit, the
legislation by necessity overrides the sovereign immunity ofthe States.

As is evident from its text, however, the SupremacyClause enshrines as "the supreme Law of the Land" only
those Federal Acts that accord with the constitutional de-sign. See Printz, 521 U. S., at 924. Appeal to the Supremacy Clause alone merely raises the question whether a lawis a valid exercise of the national power. See The Federalist
No. 33, at 204 (A. Hamilton) ("But it will not follow from thisdoctrine that acts of the larger society which are

not pursu-ant to its constitutional powers, but which are invasions of

the residuary authorities of the smaller societies, will becomethe supreme law of the land"); Printz, supra, at 924-925.

Opinion of the Court
The Constitution, by delegating to Congress the power toestablish the supreme law of the land when acting within its

enumerated powers, does not foreclose a State from assert-ing immunity to claims arising under federal law merely because that law derives not from the State itself but from thenational power. A contrary view could not be reconciled
with Hans, supra, which sustained Louisiana's immunity ina private suit arising under the Constitution itself; with

Em-ployees of Dept. of Public Health and Welfare of Mo. v. Department of Public Health and Welfare of Mo., 411 U. S. 279,283 (1973), which recognized that the FLSA was binding
upon Missouri but nevertheless upheld the State's immunityto a private suit to recover under that Act; or with numerous
other decisions to the same effect. We reject any contentionthat substantive federal law by its own force necessarily
overrides the sovereign immunity of the States. When aState asserts its immunity to suit, the question is not the
primacy of federal law but the implementation of the law ina manner consistent with the constitutional sovereignty of
the States.Nor can we conclude that the specific Article I powers delegated to Congress necessarily include, by virtue of the Nec-essary and Proper Clause or otherwise, the incidental authority to subject the States to private suits as a means ofachieving objectives otherwise within the scope of the enumerated powers. Although some of our decisions had en-dorsed this contention, see

Parden v. Terminal R. Co. of Ala.Docks Dept., 377 U. S. 184, 190-194 (1964); Pennsylvania v.

Union Gas Co., 491 U. S. 1, 13-23 (1989) (plurality opinion),they have since been overruled, see Seminole Tribe, supra,
at 63-67, 72; College Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid Post-secondary Ed. Expense Bd., ante, at 680. As we have recognized in an analogous context:

"When a `La[w] . . . for carrying into Execution' theCommerce Clause violates the principle of state

sovereignty reflected in the various constitutional

Opinion of the Court
provisions . . . it is not a `La[w] . . . proper for carryinginto Execution the Commerce Clause,' and is thus, in the

words of The Federalist, `merely [an] ac[t] of usurpation'which `deserve[s] to be treated as such.' " Printz,
supra, at 923-924 (quoting The Federalist No. 33, at 204)(ellipses and alterations in

Printz).

The cases we have cited, of course, came at last to theconclusion that neither the Supremacy Clause nor the enumerated powers of Congress confer authority to abrogate theStates' immunity from suit in federal court. The logic of the
decisions, however, does not turn on the forum in which thesuits were prosecuted but extends to state-court suits as
well.The dissenting opinion seeks to reopen these precedents,
contending that state sovereign immunity must derive eitherfrom the common law (in which case the dissent contends it
is defeasible by statute) or from natural law (in which casethe dissent believes it cannot bar a federal claim). See post,
at 797-798. As should be obvious to all, this is a false di-chotomy. The text and the structure of the Constitution
protect various rights and principles. Many of these, suchas the right to trial by jury and the prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures, derive from the common law.The common-law lineage of these rights does not mean they
are defeasible by statute or remain mere common-law rights,however. They are, rather, constitutional rights, and form
the fundamental law of the land.Although the sovereign immunity of the States derives at
least in part from the common-law tradition, the structureand history of the Constitution make clear that the immunity
exists today by constitutional design. The dissent has pro-vided no persuasive evidence that the founding generation
regarded the States' sovereign immunity as defeasible byfederal statute. While the dissent implies this view was
held by Madison and Marshall, see post, at 778, nothing inthe comments made by either individual at the ratification

734 ALDEN v. MAINE

Opinion of the Court
conventions states, or even implies, such an understanding.Although the dissent seizes upon Justice Iredell's statutory

analysis in Chisholm in an attempt to attribute this view toJustice Iredell, see

post, at 787-789, citing Chisholm, 2 Dall.,
at 449, Justice Iredell's views on the underlying constitutional question are clear enough from other portions of hisdissenting opinion:

"So much, however, has been said on the Constitution,
that it may not be improper to intimate that my presentopinion is strongly against any construction of it, which

will admit, under any circumstances, a compulsive suit
against a State for the recovery of money. I thinkevery word in the Constitution may have its full effect

without involving this consequence, and that nothing butexpress words, or an insurmountable implication (neither of which I consider, can be found in this case) wouldauthorize the deduction of so high a power."

Id., at
449-450.

Despite the dissent's assertion to the contrary, the fact
that a right is not defeasible by statute means only that it isprotected by the Constitution, not that it derives from natural law. Whether the dissent's attribution of our reasoningand conclusions to natural law results from analytical confusion or rhetorical device, it is simply inaccurate. We do not
contend the Founders could not have stripped the States ofsovereign immunity and granted Congress power to subject

them to private suit but only that they did not do so. Bythe same token, the contours of sovereign immunity are determined by the Founders' understanding, not by the principles or limitations derived from natural law.

The dissent has offered no evidence that the Founders believed sovereign immunity extended only to cases where the
sovereign was the source of the right asserted. No such
limitation existed on sovereign immunity in England, where
sovereign immunity was predicated on a different theory al527US2 Unit: $U91 [05-09-01 13:08:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN

together. See 1 F. Pollock & F. Maitland, History of EnglishLaw 518 (2d ed. 1909), quoted in Nevada v. Hall, 440 U. S.,

at 415, n. 6 (" `[The King] can not be compelled to answer inhis own court, but this is true of every petty lord of every
petty manor' "); accord, 3 W. Holdsworth, A History of Eng-lish Law 465 (3d ed. 1927) ("[N]o feudal lord could be sued
in his own court"). It is doubtful whether the King was re-garded, in any meaningful sense, as the font of the traditions
and customs which formed the substance of the common law,yet he could not be sued on a common-law claim in his own
courts. And it strains credibility to imagine that the Kingcould have been sued in his own court on, say, a French cause
of action.In light of the ratification debates and the history of the
Eleventh Amendment, there is no reason to believe theFounders intended the Constitution to preserve a more restricted immunity in the United States. On the contrary,Congress' refusal to modify the text of the Eleventh Amendment to create an exception to sovereign immunity for casesarising under treaties, see

supra, at 721, suggests the States'sovereign immunity was understood to extend beyond statelaw causes of action. And surely the dissent does not be-lieve that sovereign immunity poses no bar to a state-law
suit against the United States in federal court, or that theFederal Tort Claims Act effected a contraction, rather than
an expansion, of the United States' amenability to suit.

2
There are isolated statements in some of our cases sug-gesting that the Eleventh Amendment is inapplicable in

state courts. See Hilton v. South Carolina Public Rail-ways Comm'n, 502 U. S. 197, 204-205 (1991); Will v. Michigan Dept. of State Police, 491 U. S. 58, 63 (1989); AtascaderoState Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S., at 239-240, n. 2; Maine
v. Thiboutot, 448 U. S. 1, 9, n. 7 (1980); Hall, supra, at 418-421. This, of course, is a truism as to the literal terms of

527US2 Unit: $U91 [05-09-01 13:08:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN
736 ALDEN v. MAINE

Opinion of the Court
the Eleventh Amendment. As we have explained, however,the bare text of the Amendment is not an exhaustive description of the States' constitutional immunity from suit. Thecases, furthermore, do not decide the question presented
here--whether the States retain immunity from private
suits in their own courts notwithstanding an attempted abro-gation by the Congress.

Two of the cases discussing state-court immunity may bedismissed out of hand. The footnote digressions in

Atascadero State Hospital and Thiboutot were irrelevant to eitheropinion's holding or rationale. The discussion in

Will was
also unnecessary to the decision; our holding that 42 U. S. C.

$ 1983 did not create a cause of action against the States
rendered it unnecessary to determine the scope of the States'
constitutional immunity from suit in their own courts. Our
opinions in Hilton and Hall, however, require closer attention, for in those cases we sustained suits against States in
state courts.

In Hilton we held that an injured employee of a stateowned railroad could sue his employer (an arm of the State)
in state court under the Federal Employers' Liability Act
(FELA), 53 Stat. 1404, 45 U. S. C. $$ 51-60. Our decision
was "controlled and informed" by stare decisis. 502 U. S.,
at 201. A generation earlier we had held that because the
FELA made clear that all who operated railroads would be
subject to suit by injured workers, States that chose to enter
the railroad business after the statute's enactment impliedly
waived their sovereign immunity from such suits. See Parden v. Terminal R. Co. of Ala. Docks Dept., 377 U. S. 184
(1964). Some States had excluded railroad workers from
the coverage of their workers' compensation statutes on the
assumption that the FELA provided adequate protection for
those workers. Hilton, 502 U. S., at 202. Closing the
courts to FELA suits against state employers would have
dislodged settled expectations and required an extensive legislative response. Ibid.

Opinion of the Court
There is language in Hilton which gives some support tothe position of petitioners here but our decision did not

squarely address, much less resolve, the question of Con-gress' power to abrogate States' immunity from suit in their
own courts. The respondent in Hilton, the South Carolina
Public Railways Commission, neither contested Congress'constitutional authority to subject it to suits for money damages nor raised sovereign immunity as an affirmative de-fense. See Brief for Respondent in No. 90-848, O. T. 1991,
pp. 7, n. 14, 21. Nor was the State's litigation strategy sur-prising.

Hilton was litigated and decided in the wake of
Union Gas, and before this Court's decisions in New York,
Printz, and Seminole Tribe. At that time it may have
appeared to the State that Congress' power to abrogate its
immunity from suit in any court was not limited by the Constitution at all, so long as Congress made its intent sufficiently clear.

Furthermore, our decision in Parden was based on concepts of waiver and consent. Although later decisions have
undermined the basis of Parden's reasoning, see, e. g., Welch
v. Texas Dept. of Highways and Public Transp., 483 U. S.
468, 476-478 (1987) (recognizing that Parden erred in finding
a clear congressional intent to subject the States to suit);
College Savings Bank, ante, at 680 (overruling Parden's theory of constructive waiver), we have not questioned the general proposition that a State may waive its sovereign immunity and consent to suit, see Seminole Tribe, 517 U. S., at 65.

Hilton, then, must be read in light of the doctrinal basis
of Parden, the issues presented and argued by the parties,
and the substantial reliance interests drawn into question by
the litigation. When so read, we believe the decision is best
understood not as recognizing a congressional power to subject nonconsenting States to private suits in their own
courts, nor even as endorsing the constructive waiver theory
of Parden, but as simply adhering, as a matter of stare decisis and presumed historical fact, to the narrow proposition

527US2 Unit: $U91 [05-09-01 13:08:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN
738 ALDEN v. MAINE

Opinion of the Court
that certain States had consented to be sued by injuredworkers covered by the FELA, at least in their own courts.

In Hall we considered whether California could subjectNevada to suit in California's courts and determined the
Constitution did not bar it from doing so. We noted that
"[t]he doctrine of sovereign immunity is an amalgam of twoquite different concepts, one applicable to suits in the sovereign's own courts and the other to suits in the courts of an-other sovereign." 440 U. S., at 414. We acknowledged that
"[t]he immunity of a truly independent sovereign from suitin its own courts has been enjoyed as a matter of absolute
right for centuries. Only the sovereign's own consent couldqualify the absolute character of that immunity,"

ibid., that
"the notion that immunity from suit is an attribute of sovereignty is reflected in our cases," id., at 415, and that "[t]hisexplanation adequately supports the conclusion that no sovereign may be sued in its own courts without its consent,"
id., at 416. We sharply distinguished, however, a sovereign's immunity from suit in the courts of another sovereign:

"[B]ut [this explanation] affords no support for a claim
of immunity in another sovereign's courts. Such a claim
necessarily implicates the power and authority of a second sovereign; its source must be found either in an
agreement, express or implied, between the two sovereigns, or in the voluntary decision of the second to
respect the dignity of the first as a matter of comity."
Ibid.

Since we determined the Constitution did not reflect an
agreement between the States to respect the sovereign immunity of one another, California was free to determine
whether it would respect Nevada's sovereignty as a matter
of comity.

Our opinion in Hall did distinguish a State's immunity
from suit in federal court from its immunity in the courts of

527US2 Unit: $U91 [05-09-01 13:08:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN

739Cite as: 527 U. S. 706 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
other States; it did not, however, address or consider any
differences between a State's sovereign immunity in federal
court and in its own courts. Our reluctance to find an implied constitutional limit on the power of the States cannot
be construed, furthermore, to support an analogous reluctance to find implied constitutional limits on the power of the
Federal Government. The Constitution, after all, treats the
powers of the States differently from the powers of the Federal Government. As we explained in Hall:

"[I]n view of the Tenth Amendment's reminder that
powers not delegated to the Federal Government nor
prohibited to the States are reserved to the States or to
the people, the existence of express limitations on state
sovereignty may equally imply that caution should be
exercised before concluding that unstated limitations on
state power were intended by the Framers." Id., at 425
(footnote omitted).

The Federal Government, by contrast, "can claim no powers
which are not granted to it by the constitution, and the powers actually granted must be such as are expressly given,
or given by necessary implication." Martin v. Hunter's
Lessee, 1 Wheat. 304, 326 (1816); see also City of Boerne v.
Flores, 521 U. S. 507, 516 (1997); United States v. Lopez, 514
U. S. 549, 552 (1995).

Our decision in Hall thus does not support the argument
urged by petitioners here. The decision addressed neither
Congress' power to subject States to private suits nor the
States' immunity from suit in their own courts. In fact, the
distinction drawn between a sovereign's immunity in its own
courts and its immunity in the courts of another sovereign,
as well as the reasoning on which this distinction was based,
are consistent with, and even support, the proposition urged
by respondent here--that the Constitution reserves to the

740 ALDEN v. MAINE

Opinion of the Court
States a constitutional immunity from private suits in theirown courts which cannot be abrogated by Congress.

Petitioners seek support in two additional decisions. In
Reich v. Collins, 513 U. S. 106 (1994), we held that, despite
its immunity from suit in federal court, a State which holds
out what plainly appears to be "a clear and certain" postdep-rivation remedy for taxes collected in violation of federal

law may not declare, after disputed taxes have been paid inreliance on this remedy, that the remedy does not in fact
exist. Id., at 108. This case arose in the context of tax-refund litigation, where a State may deprive a taxpayer of
all other means of challenging the validity of its tax laws by
holding out what appears to be a "clear and certain" postdeprivation remedy. Ibid.; see also Fair Assessment in Real
Estate Assn., Inc. v. McNary, 454 U. S. 100 (1981). In this
context, due process requires the State to provide the remedy it has promised. Cf. Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U. S. 517,
539 (1984) (O'Connor, J., concurring). The obligation arises
from the Constitution itself; Reich does not speak to the
power of Congress to subject States to suits in their own
courts.

In Howlett v. Rose, 496 U. S. 356 (1990), we held that a
state court could not refuse to hear a $ 1983 suit against a
school board on the basis of sovereign immunity. The school
board was not an arm of the State, however, so it could not
assert any constitutional defense of sovereign immunity to
which the State would have been entitled. See Mt. Healthy
City Bd. of Ed. v. Doyle, 429 U. S. 274, 280 (1977). In Howlett, then, the only question was "whether a state-law defense of `sovereign immunity' is available to a school board
otherwise subject to suit in a Florida court even though such
a defense would not be available if the action had been
brought in a federal forum." 496 U. S., at 358-359. The
decision did not address the question of Congress' power to
compel a state court to entertain an action against a nonconsenting State.

Opinion of the Court

B
Whether Congress has authority under Article I to abrogate a State's immunity from suit in its own courts is, then,
a question of first impression. In determining whether
there is "compelling evidence" that this derogation of the
States' sovereignty is "inherent in the constitutional compact," Blatchford, 501 U. S., at 781, we continue our discussion of history, practice, precedent, and the structure of the
Constitution.

1

We look first to evidence of the original understanding of
the Constitution. Petitioners contend that because the ratification debates and the events surrounding the adoption of
the Eleventh Amendment focused on the States' immunity
from suit in federal courts, the historical record gives no
instruction as to the founding generation's intent to preserve
the States' immunity from suit in their own courts.

We believe, however, that the Founders' silence is best explained by the simple fact that no one, not even the Constitution's most ardent opponents, suggested the document might
strip the States of the immunity. In light of the overriding
concern regarding the States' war-time debts, together with
the well-known creativity, foresight, and vivid imagination
of the Constitution's opponents, the silence is most instructive. It suggests the sovereign's right to assert immunity
from suit in its own courts was a principle so well established
that no one conceived it would be altered by the new
Constitution.

The arguments raised against the Constitution confirm
this strong inference. In England, the rule was well established that "no lord could be sued by a vassal in his own
court, but each petty lord was subject to suit in the courts
of a higher lord." Hall, 440 U. S., at 414-415. It was argued that, by analogy, the States could be sued without consent in federal court. Id., at 418. The point of the argu527US2 Unit: $U91 [05-09-01 13:08:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN
742 ALDEN v. MAINE

Opinion of the Court
ment was that federal jurisdiction under Article III wouldcircumvent the States' immunity from suit in their own

courts. The argument would have made little sense if theStates were understood to have relinquished the immunity
in all events.

The response the Constitution's advocates gave to the ar-gument is also telling. Relying on custom and practice--

and, in particular, on the States' immunity from suit in theirown courts, see 3 Elliot's Debates 555 (remarks of J. Marshall)--they contended that no individual could sue a sover-eign without its consent. It is true the point was directed
toward the power of the Federal Judiciary, for that was the
only question at issue. The logic of the argument, however,
applies with even greater force in the context of a suit prosecuted against a sovereign in its own courts, for in this setting, more than any other, sovereign immunity was long
established and unquestioned. See Hall, supra, at 414.

Similarly, while the Eleventh Amendment by its terms addresses only "the Judicial power of the United States," nothing in Chisholm, the catalyst for the Amendment, suggested
the States were not immune from suits in their own courts.
The only Justice to address the issue, in fact, was explicit in
distinguishing between sovereign immunity in federal court
and in a State's own courts. See 2 Dall., at 452 (opinion of
Blair, J.) ("When sovereigns are sued in their own Courts,
such a method [a petition of right] may have been established
as the most respectful form of demand; but we are not now
in a State-Court; and if sovereignty be an exemption from
suit in any other than the sovereign's own Courts, it follows
that when a State, by adopting the Constitution, has agreed
to be amenable to the judicial power of the United States,
she has, in that respect, given up her right of sovereignty").

The language of the Eleventh Amendment, furthermore,
was directed toward the only provisions of the constitutional
text believed to call the States' immunity from private suits
into question. Although Article III expressly contemplated

527US2 Unit: $U91 [05-09-01 13:08:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN

743Cite as: 527 U. S. 706 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
jurisdiction over suits between States and individuals, noth-ing in the Article or in any other part of the Constitution

suggested the States could not assert immunity from privatesuit in their own courts or that Congress had the power to
abrogate sovereign immunity there.Finally, the Congress which endorsed the Eleventh
Amendment rejected language limiting the Amendment'sscope to cases where the States had made available a remedy
in their own courts. See supra, at 721. Implicit in the pro-posal, it is evident, was the premise that the States retained
their immunity and the concomitant authority to decidewhether to allow private suits against the sovereign in their
own courts.In light of the language of the Constitution and the historical context, it is quite apparent why neither the ratificationdebates nor the language of the Eleventh Amendment addressed the States' immunity from suit in their own courts.The concerns voiced at the ratifying conventions, the furor
raised by Chisholm, and the speed and unanimity with whichthe Amendment was adopted, moreover, underscore the jealous care with which the founding generation sought to pre-serve the sovereign immunity of the States. To read this
history as permitting the inference that the Constitutionstripped the States of immunity in their own courts and allowed Congress to subject them to suit there would turn onits head the concern of the founding generation--that Article
III might be used to circumvent state-court immunity. Inlight of the historical record it is difficult to conceive that
the Constitution would have been adopted if it had been un-derstood to strip the States of immunity from suit in their
own courts and cede to the Federal Government a power tosubject nonconsenting States to private suits in these fora.

2
Our historical analysis is supported by early congressionalpractice, which provides "contemporaneous and weighty evi527US2 Unit: $U91 [05-09-01 13:08:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN
744 ALDEN v. MAINE

Opinion of the Court
dence of the Constitution's meaning." Printz, 521 U. S., at
905 (internal quotation marks omitted). Although early
Congresses enacted various statutes authorizing federal
suits in state court, see id., at 906-907 (listing statutes);
Testa v. Katt, 330 U. S. 386, 389-390 (1947), we have discovered no instance in which they purported to authorize suits
against nonconsenting States in these fora. The "numerousness of these statutes [authorizing suit in state court], contrasted with the utter lack of statutes" subjecting States to
suit, "suggests an assumed absence of such power." 521
U. S., at 907-908. It thus appears early Congresses did not
believe they had the power to authorize private suits against
the States in their own courts.

Not only were statutes purporting to authorize private
suits against nonconsenting States in state courts not
enacted by early Congresses; statutes purporting to authorize such suits in any forum are all but absent from our historical experience. The first statute we confronted that even
arguably purported to subject the States to private actions
was the FELA. See Parden, 377 U. S., at 187 ("Here, for
the first time in this Court, a State's claim of immunity
against suit by an individual meets a suit brought upon a
cause of action expressly created by Congress"). As we
later recognized, however, even this statute did not clearly
create a cause of action against the States. See Welch, 483
U. S., at 476-478. The provisions of the FLSA at issue here,
which were enacted in the aftermath of Parden, are among
the first statutory enactments purporting in express terms
to subject nonconsenting States to private suits. Although
similar statutes have multiplied in the last generation, "they
are of such recent vintage that they are no more probative
than the [FLSA] of a constitutional tradition that lends
meaning to the text. Their persuasive force is far outweighed by almost two centuries of apparent congressional
avoidance of the practice." Printz, supra, at 918.

Opinion of the Court
Even the recent statutes, moreover, do not provide evi-dence of an understanding that Congress has a greater

power to subject States to suit in their own courts than infederal courts. On the contrary, the statutes purport to create causes of actions against the States which are enforce-able in federal, as well as state, court. To the extent recent
practice thus departs from longstanding tradition, it reflectsnot so much an understanding that the States have surrendered their immunity from suit in their own courts as theerroneous view, perhaps inspired by

Parden and Union Gas,that Congress may subject nonconsenting States to private

suits in any forum. 3

The theory and reasoning of our earlier cases suggest theStates do retain a constitutional immunity from suit in their
own courts. We have often described the States' immunityin sweeping terms, without reference to whether the suit
was prosecuted in state or federal court. See, e. g., Briscoev.

Bank of Kentucky, 11 Pet. 257, 321-322 (1837) ("No sover-eign state is liable to be sued without her consent"); Board

of Liquidation v. McComb, 92 U. S. 531, 541 (1876) ("A State,without its consent, cannot be sued by an individual"); In re
Ayers, 123 U. S. 443, 506 (1887) (same); Great Northern Life
Ins. Co. v. Read, 322 U. S. 47, 51 (1944) ("The inherent natureof sovereignty prevents actions against a state by its own

citizens without its consent").We have said on many occasions, furthermore, that the
States retain their immunity from private suits prosecutedin their own courts. See, e. g., Beers v. Arkansas, 20 How.
527, 529 (1858) ("It is an established principle of jurispru-dence in all civilized nations that the sovereign cannot be
sued in its own courts, or in any other, without its consentand permission");

be sued in its own courts without its consent. This is a priv-ilege of sovereignty"); Cunningham v. Macon & Brunswick

We have also relied on the States' immunity in their own
courts as a premise in our Eleventh Amendment rulings.
See Hans, 134 U. S., at 10 ("It is true the amendment does
so read, and, if there were no other reason or ground for
abating his suit, it might be maintainable; and then we
should have this anomalous result [that a State may be sued
by its own citizen though not by the citizen of another State,
and that a State] may be thus sued in the federal courts,
although not allowing itself to be sued in its own courts. If
this is the necessary consequence of the language of the Con527US2 Unit: $U91 [05-09-01 13:08:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN

stitution and the law, the result is no less startling and unex-pected than [Chisholm]"); id., at 18 ("The state courts have

no power to entertain suits by individuals against a Statewithout its consent. Then how does the Circuit Court, having only concurrent jurisdiction, acquire any such power?").In particular, the exception to our sovereign immunity
doctrine recognized in Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123 (1908),is based in part on the premise that sovereign immunity bars
relief against States and their officers in both state and fed-eral courts, and that certain suits for declaratory or injunctive relief against state officers must therefore be permittedif the Constitution is to remain the supreme law of the land.
As we explained in General Oil Co. v. Crain, 209 U. S. 211(1908), a case decided the same day as Ex parte Young and
extending the rule of that case to state-court suits:

"It seems to be an obvious consequence that as a Statecan only perform its functions through its officers, a restraint upon them is a restraint upon its sovereigntyfrom which it is exempt without its consent in the state
tribunals, and exempt by the Eleventh Amendment ofthe Constitution of the United States, in the national
tribunals. The error is in the universality of the conclu-sion, as we have seen. Necessarily to give adequate
protection to constitutional rights a distinction must bemade between valid and invalid state laws, as determining the character of the suit against state officers. Andthe suit at bar illustrates the necessity. If a suit against
state officers is precluded in the national courts by theEleventh Amendment to the Constitution, and may be
forbidden by a State to its courts, as it is contended inthe case at bar that it may be, without power of review
by this court, it must be evident that an easy way isopen to prevent the enforcement of many provisions of
the Constitution . . . . See Ex parte Young, [209 U. S.,at] 123, where this subject is fully discussed and the
cases reviewed." 209 U. S., at 226-227.

Opinion of the Court
Had we not understood the States to retain a constitutionalimmunity from suit in their own courts, the need for the Ex

parte Young rule would have been less pressing, and the rulewould not have formed so essential a part of our sovereign
immunity doctrine. See Idaho v. Coeur d'Alene Tribe of
Idaho, 521 U. S., at 270-271 (principal opinion).As it is settled doctrine that neither substantive federal

law nor attempted congressional abrogation under Article Ibars a State from raising a constitutional defense of sovereign immunity in federal court, see Part II-A-1, supra, ourdecisions suggesting that the States retain an analogous constitutional immunity from private suits in their own courtssupport the conclusion that Congress lacks the Article I
power to subject the States to private suits in those fora.

4
Our final consideration is whether a congressional powerto subject nonconsenting States to private suits in their own

courts is consistent with the structure of the Constitution.We look both to the essential principles of federalism and to
the special role of the state courts in the constitutionaldesign.

Although the Constitution grants broad powers to Con-gress, our federalism requires that Congress treat the States
in a manner consistent with their status as residuary sover-eigns and joint participants in the governance of the Nation.
See, e. g., United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S., at 583 (Kennedy,
J., concurring); Printz, 521 U. S., at 935; New York, 505 U. S.,at 188. The founding generation thought it "neither becoming nor convenient that the several States of the Union, in-vested with that large residuum of sovereignty which had
not been delegated to the United States, should be sum-moned as defendants to answer the complaints of private
persons." In re Ayers, 123 U. S., at 505. The principle ofsovereign immunity preserved by constitutional design
"thus accords the States the respect owed them as members

527US2 Unit: $U91 [05-09-01 13:08:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
of the federation." Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority, 506 U. S., at 146; accord, Coeur d'Alene Tribe, supra,
at 268 (recognizing "the dignity and respect afforded a State,which the immunity is designed to protect").

Petitioners contend that immunity from suit in federal
court suffices to preserve the dignity of the States. Privatesuits against nonconsenting States, however, present "the indignity of subjecting a State to the coercive process of judi-cial tribunals at the instance of private parties,"

In re Ayers,
supra, at 505; accord, Seminole Tribe, 517 U. S., at 58, re-gardless of the forum. Not only must a State defend or default but also it must face the prospect of being thrust, by
federal fiat and against its will, into the disfavored status of
a debtor, subject to the power of private citizens to levy on
its treasury or perhaps even government buildings or property which the State administers on the public's behalf.

In some ways, of course, a congressional power to authorize private suits against nonconsenting States in their own
courts would be even more offensive to state sovereignty
than a power to authorize the suits in a federal forum. Although the immunity of one sovereign in the courts of another has often depended in part on comity or agreement,
the immunity of a sovereign in its own courts has always
been understood to be within the sole control of the sovereign itself. See generally Hall, 440 U. S., at 414-418. A
power to press a State's own courts into federal service to
coerce the other branches of the State, furthermore, is the
power first to turn the State against itself and ultimately to
commandeer the entire political machinery of the State
against its will and at the behest of individuals. Cf. Coeur
d'Alene Tribe, supra, at 276. Such plenary federal control
of state governmental processes denigrates the separate sovereignty of the States.

It is unquestioned that the Federal Government retains
its own immunity from suit not only in state tribunals but
also in its own courts. In light of our constitutional system

527US2 Unit: $U91 [05-09-01 13:08:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN
750 ALDEN v. MAINE

Opinion of the Court
recognizing the essential sovereignty of the States, we arereluctant to conclude that the States are not entitled to a

reciprocal privilege.Underlying constitutional form are considerations of great
substance. Private suits against nonconsenting States--especially suits for money damages--may threaten the finan-cial integrity of the States. It is indisputable that, at the

time of the founding, many of the States could have beenforced into insolvency but for their immunity from private
suits for money damages. Even today, an unlimited con-gressional power to authorize suits in state court to levy
upon the treasuries of the States for compensatory damages,
attorney's fees, and even punitive damages could create staggering burdens, giving Congress a power and a leverage
over the States that is not contemplated by our constitutional design. The potential national power would pose
a severe and notorious danger to the States and their
resources.

A congressional power to strip the States of their immunity from private suits in their own courts would pose more
subtle risks as well. "The principle of immunity from litigation assures the states and the nation from unanticipated intervention in the processes of government." Great Northern Life Ins. Co. v. Read, 322 U. S., at 53. When the States'
immunity from private suits is disregarded, "the course of
their public policy and the administration of their public affairs" may become "subject to and controlled by the mandates of judicial tribunals without their consent, and in favor
of individual interests." In re Ayers, supra, at 505. While
the States have relinquished their immunity from suit in
some special contexts--at least as a practical matter--see
Part III, infra, this surrender carries with it substantial
costs to the autonomy, the decisionmaking ability, and the
sovereign capacity of the States.

A general federal power to authorize private suits for
money damages would place unwarranted strain on the

Opinion of the Court
States' ability to govern in accordance with the will of theircitizens. Today, as at the time of the founding, the allocation

of scarce resources among competing needs and interests liesat the heart of the political process. While the judgment
creditor of a State may have a legitimate claim for compensation, other important needs and worthwhile ends competefor access to the public fisc. Since all cannot be satisfied in

full, it is inevitable that difficult decisions involving the mostsensitive and political of judgments must be made. If the
principle of representative government is to be preserved tothe States, the balance between competing interests must be
reached after deliberation by the political process established by the citizens of the State, not by judicial decree mandated by the Federal Government and invoked by the private citizen. "It needs no argument to show that the
political power cannot be thus ousted of its jurisdiction and
the judiciary set in its place." Louisiana v. Jumel, 107 U. S.
711, 727-728 (1883).

By " `split[ting] the atom of sovereignty,' " the Founders
established " `two orders of government, each with its own
direct relationship, its own privity, its own set of mutual
rights and obligations to the people who sustain it and are
governed by it.' " Saenz v. Roe, 526 U. S. 489, 504, n. 17
(1999), quoting U. S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton, 514 U. S.
779, 838 (1995) (Kennedy, J., concurring). "The Constitution thus contemplates that a State's government will represent and remain accountable to its own citizens." Printz,
521 U. S., at 920. When the Federal Government asserts
authority over a State's most fundamental political processes, it strikes at the heart of the political accountability so
essential to our liberty and republican form of government.

The asserted authority would blur not only the distinct
responsibilities of the State and National Governments but
also the separate duties of the judicial and political branches
of the state governments, displacing "state decisions that `go
to the heart of representative government.' " Gregory v.

527US2 Unit: $U91 [05-09-01 13:08:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN
752 ALDEN v. MAINE

Opinion of the Court
Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452, 461 (1991). A State is entitled toorder the processes of its own governance, assigning to the

political branches, rather than the courts, the responsibil-ity for directing the payment of debts. See

id., at 460
("Through the structure of its government, and the character
of those who exercise government authority, a State definesitself as a sovereign"). If Congress could displace a State's

allocation of governmental power and responsibility, the ju-dicial branch of the State, whose legitimacy derives from fidelity to the law, would be compelled to assume a role notonly foreign to its experience but beyond its competence as
defined by the very Constitution from which its existence
derives.

Congress cannot abrogate the States' sovereign immunity
in federal court; were the rule to be different here, the National Government would wield greater power in the state
courts than in its own judicial instrumentalities. Cf. Howlett, 496 U. S., at 365 (noting the anomaly that would arise if
"a State might be forced to entertain in its own courts suits
from which it was immune in federal court"); Hilton, 502
U. S., at 206 (recognizing the "federalism-related concerns
that arise when the National Government uses the state
courts as the exclusive forum to permit recovery under a
congressional statute").

The resulting anomaly cannot be explained by reference
to the special role of the state courts in the constitutional
design. Although Congress may not require the legislative
or executive branches of the States to enact or administer
federal regulatory programs, see Printz, supra, at 935; New
York, 505 U. S., at 188, it may require state courts of "adequate and appropriate" jurisdiction, Testa, 330 U. S., at 394,
"to enforce federal prescriptions, insofar as those prescriptions relat[e] to matters appropriate for the judicial power,"
Printz, supra, at 907. It would be an unprecedented step,
however, to infer from the fact that Congress may declare
federal law binding and enforceable in state courts the fur527US2 Unit: $U91 [05-09-01 13:08:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN

753Cite as: 527 U. S. 706 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
ther principle that Congress' authority to pursue federal objectives through the state judiciaries exceeds not only its
power to press other branches of the State into its service
but even its control over the federal courts themselves. The
conclusion would imply that Congress may in some cases act
only through instrumentalities of the States. Yet, as Chief
Justice Marshall explained: "No trace is to be found in the
constitution of an intention to create a dependence of the
government of the Union on those of the States, for the execution of the great powers assigned to it. Its means are
adequate to its ends; and on those means alone was it expected to rely for the accomplishment of its ends." McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 424 (1819); cf. Osborn v.
Bank of United States, 9 Wheat. 738, 821 (1824) ("It is not
insinuated that the judicial power, in cases depending on the
character of the cause, cannot be exercised in the first instance, in the Courts of the Union, but must first be exercised in the tribunals of the State").

The provisions of the Constitution upon which we have
relied in finding the state courts peculiarly amenable to federal command, moreover, do not distinguish those courts
from the Federal Judiciary. The Supremacy Clause does impose specific obligations on state judges. There can be no
serious contention, however, that the Supremacy Clause imposes greater obligations on state-court judges than on the
Judiciary of the United States itself. The text of Article III,

$ 1, which extends federal judicial power to enumerated
classes of suits but grants Congress discretion whether to
establish inferior federal courts, does give strong support to
the inference that state courts may be opened to suits falling
within the federal judicial power. The Article in no way
suggests, however, that state courts may be required to assume jurisdiction that could not be vested in the federal
courts and forms no part of the judicial power of the
United States.

Opinion of the Court
We have recognized that Congress may require statecourts to hear only "matters appropriate for the judicial

power," Printz, 521 U. S., at 907. Our sovereign immunityprecedents establish that suits against nonconsenting States
are not "properly susceptible of litigation in courts," Hans,134 U. S., at 12, and, as a result, that "[t]he `entire judicial
power granted by the Constitution' does not embrace author-ity to entertain such suits in the absence of the State's consent," Principality of Monaco, 292 U. S., at 329 (quoting Ex
parte New York, 256 U. S., at 497); accord, 292 U. S., at 322-323 (private suits against nonconsenting sovereigns are not

"of a justiciable character"). We are aware of no constitu-tional precept that would admit of a congressional power to
require state courts to entertain federal suits which are notwithin the judicial power of the United States and could not
be heard in federal courts. As we explained in Erie R. Co.v.

Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64 (1938):

"[T]he Constitution of the United States . . . recognizesand preserves the autonomy and independence of the

States--independence in their legislative and independ-ence in their judicial departments. Supervision over
either the legislative or the judicial action of the Statesis in no case permissible except as to matters by the
Constitution specifically authorized or delegated to theUnited States. Any interference with either, except as
thus permitted, is an invasion of the authority of theState and, to that extent, a denial of its independence."
Id., at 78-79.
In light of history, practice, precedent, and the structureof the Constitution, we hold that the States retain immunity

from private suit in their own courts, an immunity beyondthe congressional power to abrogate by Article I legislation.

Opinion of the Court
State a concomitant right to disregard the Constitution orvalid federal law. The States and their officers are bound

by obligations imposed by the Constitution and by federalstatutes that comport with the constitutional design. We
are unwilling to assume the States will refuse to honor the
Constitution or obey the binding laws of the United States.The good faith of the States thus provides an important assurance that "[t]his Constitution, and the Laws of the UnitedStates which shall be made in Pursuance thereof . . . shall be
the supreme Law of the Land." U. S. Const., Art. VI.Sovereign immunity, moreover, does not bar all judicial
review of state compliance with the Constitution and valid
federal law. Rather, certain limits are implicit in the constitutional principle of state sovereign immunity.

The first of these limits is that sovereign immunity bars
suits only in the absence of consent. Many States, on their
own initiative, have enacted statutes consenting to a wide
variety of suits. The rigors of sovereign immunity are thus
"mitigated by a sense of justice which has continually expanded by consent the suability of the sovereign." Great
Northern Life Ins. Co. v. Read, 322 U. S., at 53. Nor, subject
to constitutional limitations, does the Federal Government
lack the authority or means to seek the States' voluntary
consent to private suits. Cf. South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U. S.
203 (1987).

The States have consented, moreover, to some suits pursuant to the plan of the Convention or to subsequent constitutional Amendments. In ratifying the Constitution, the
States consented to suits brought by other States or by the
Federal Government. Principality of Monaco, supra, at
328-329 (collecting cases). A suit which is commenced and
prosecuted against a State in the name of the United States
by those who are entrusted with the constitutional duty to
"take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed," U. S.
Const., Art. II, $ 3, differs in kind from the suit of an individual: While the Constitution contemplates suits among the

527US2 Unit: $U91 [05-09-01 13:08:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN
756 ALDEN v. MAINE

Opinion of the Court
members of the federal system as an alternative to extrale-gal measures, the fear of private suits against nonconsenting

States was the central reason given by the Founders whochose to preserve the States' sovereign immunity. Suits
brought by the United States itself require the exercise of
political responsibility for each suit prosecuted against aState, a control which is absent from a broad delegation to

private persons to sue nonconsenting States.We have held also that in adopting the Fourteenth Amendment, the people required the States to surrender a portionof the sovereignty that had been preserved to them by the
original Constitution, so that Congress may authorize private suits against nonconsenting States pursuant to its $ 5
enforcement power. Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U. S. 445
(1976). By imposing explicit limits on the powers of the
States and granting Congress the power to enforce them, the
Amendment "fundamentally altered the balance of state and
federal power struck by the Constitution." Seminole Tribe,
517 U. S., at 59. When Congress enacts appropriate legislation to enforce this Amendment, see City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U. S. 507 (1997), federal interests are paramount, and
Congress may assert an authority over the States which
would be otherwise unauthorized by the Constitution. Fitzpatrick, supra, at 456.

The second important limit to the principle of sovereign
immunity is that it bars suits against States but not lesser
entities. The immunity does not extend to suits prosecuted
against a municipal corporation or other governmental entity
which is not an arm of the State. See, e. g., Mt. Healthy
City Bd. of Ed. v. Doyle, 429 U. S., at 280; Lincoln County
v. Luning, 133 U. S. 529 (1890). Nor does sovereign immunity bar all suits against state officers. Some suits against
state officers are barred by the rule that sovereign immunity
is not limited to suits which name the State as a party if the
suits are, in fact, against the State. See, e. g., In re Ayers,
123 U. S., at 505-506; Idaho v. Coeur d'Alene Tribe of Idaho,

527US2 Unit: $U91 [05-09-01 13:08:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
521 U. S., at 270 ("The real interests served by the EleventhAmendment are not to be sacrificed to elementary mechanics

of captions and pleading"). The rule, however, does not barcertain actions against state officers for injunctive or declaratory relief. Compare Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123 (1908),and

In re Ayers, supra, with Coeur d'Alene Tribe of Idaho,supra, Seminole Tribe, supra, and Edelman v. Jordan, 415

U. S. 651 (1974). Even a suit for money damages may beprosecuted against a state officer in his individual capacity
for unconstitutional or wrongful conduct fairly attributableto the officer himself, so long as the relief is sought not from
the state treasury but from the officer personally. Scheuerv.

Rhodes, 416 U. S. 232, 237-238 (1974); Ford Motor Co. v.Department of Treasury of Ind., 323 U. S. 459, 462 (1945).

The principle of sovereign immunity as reflected in ourjurisprudence strikes the proper balance between the supremacy of federal law and the separate sovereignty of theStates. See Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U. S., at 105. Established rules provide amplemeans to correct ongoing violations of law and to vindicate
the interests which animate the Supremacy Clause. See
Green v. Mansour, 474 U. S., at 68. That we have, duringthe first 210 years of our constitutional history, found it unnecessary to decide the question presented here suggests afederal power to subject nonconsenting States to private
suits in their own courts is unnecessary to uphold the Consti-tution and valid federal statutes as the supreme law.

IV
The sole remaining question is whether Maine has waivedits immunity. The State of Maine "regards the immunity

from suit as `one of the highest attributes inherent in thenature of sovereignty,' "

Cushing v. Cohen, 420 A. 2d 919,923 (Me. 1981) (quoting Drake v. Smith, 390 A. 2d 541, 543

(Me. 1978)), and adheres to the general rule that "a specificauthority conferred by an enactment of the legislature is req527US2 Unit: $U91 [05-09-01 13:08:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN
758 ALDEN v. MAINE

Opinion of the Court
uisite if the sovereign is to be taken as having shed the pro-tective mantle of immunity," 420 A. 2d, at 923. Petitioners

have not attempted to establish a waiver of immunity underthis standard. Although petitioners contend the State has
discriminated against federal rights by claiming sovereignimmunity from this FLSA suit, there is no evidence that the
State has manipulated its immunity in a systematic fashionto discriminate against federal causes of action. To the extent Maine has chosen to consent to certain classes of suitswhile maintaining its immunity from others, it has done no
more than exercise a privilege of sovereignty concomitant toits constitutional immunity from suit. The State, we conclude, has not consented to suit.

V
This case at one level concerns the formal structure of fed-eralism, but in a Constitution as resilient as ours form mirrors substance. Congress has vast power but not all power.When Congress legislates in matters affecting the States, it
may not treat these sovereign entities as mere prefecturesor corporations. Congress must accord States the esteem
due to them as joint participants in a federal system, onebeginning with the premise of sovereignty in both the central Government and the separate States. Congress hasample means to ensure compliance with valid federal laws,
but it must respect the sovereignty of the States.In an apparent attempt to disparage a conclusion with
which it disagrees, the dissent attributes our reasoning tonatural law. We seek to discover, however, only what the
Framers and those who ratified the Constitution sought toaccomplish when they created a federal system. We appeal
to no higher authority than the Charter which they wroteand adopted. Theirs was the unique insight that freedom is
enhanced by the creation of two governments, not one. Weneed not attach a label to our dissenting colleagues' insistence that the constitutional structure adopted by the Found527US2 Unit: $U91 [05-09-01 13:08:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN

759Cite as: 527 U. S. 706 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
ers must yield to the politics of the moment. Although theConstitution begins with the principle that sovereignty rests

with the people, it does not follow that the National Govern-ment becomes the ultimate, preferred mechanism for expressing the people's will. The States exist as a refutation
of that concept. In choosing to ordain and establish theConstitution, the people insisted upon a federal structure for

the very purpose of rejecting the idea that the will of thepeople in all instances is expressed by the central power, the
one most remote from their control. The Framers of theConstitution did not share our dissenting colleagues' belief
that the Congress may circumvent the federal design by regulating the States directly when it pleases to do so, including by a proxy in which individual citizens are authorized to
levy upon the state treasuries absent the States' consent to
jurisdiction.

The case before us depends upon these principles. The
State of Maine has not questioned Congress' power to prescribe substantive rules of federal law to which it must comply. Despite an initial good-faith disagreement about the requirements of the FLSA, it is conceded by all that the State
has altered its conduct so that its compliance with federal
law cannot now be questioned. The Solicitor General of the
United States has appeared before this Court, however, and
asserted that the federal interest in compensating the
States' employees for alleged past violations of federal law
is so compelling that the sovereign State of Maine must be
stripped of its immunity and subjected to suit in its own
courts by its own employees. Yet, despite specific statutory
authorization, see 29 U. S. C. $ 216(c), the United States apparently found the same interests insufficient to justify sending even a single attorney to Maine to prosecute this litigation. The difference between a suit by the United States on
behalf of the employees and a suit by the employees implicates a rule that the National Government must itself deem
the case of sufficient importance to take action against the

Souter, J., dissenting
State; and history, precedent, and the structure of the Con-stitution make clear that, under the plan of the Convention,

the States have consented to suits of the first kind but notof the second. The judgment of the Supreme Judicial Court
of Maine is

Affirmed.

Justice Souter, with whom Justice Stevens, Justice
Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer join, dissenting.

In Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44 (1996),a majority of this Court invoked the Eleventh Amendment

to declare that the federal judicial power under Article IIIof the Constitution does not reach a private action against a
State, even on a federal question. In the Court's conception,however, the Eleventh Amendment was understood as having been enhanced by a "background principle" of state sovereign immunity (understood as immunity to suit), see id., at
72, that operated beyond its limited codification in the
Amendment, dealing solely with federal citizen-state diversity jurisdiction. To the Seminole Tribe dissenters, of
whom I was one, the Court's enhancement of the Amendment was at odds with constitutional history and at war with
the conception of divided sovereignty that is the essence of
American federalism.

Today's issue arises naturally in the aftermath of the decision in Seminole Tribe. The Court holds that the Constitution bars an individual suit against a State to enforce a federal statutory right under the Fair Labor Standards Act of
1938 (FLSA), 29 U. S. C. $ 201 et seq. (1994 ed. and Supp. III),
when brought in the State's courts over its objection. In
thus complementing its earlier decision, the Court of course
confronts the fact that the state forum renders the Eleventh
Amendment beside the point, and it has responded by discerning a simpler and more straightforward theory of state
sovereign immunity than it found in Seminole Tribe: a
State's sovereign immunity from all individual suits is a "fun527US2 Unit: $U91 [05-09-01 13:08:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN

damental aspect" of state sovereignty "confirm[ed]" by theTenth Amendment.

Ante, at 713, 714. As a consequence,
Seminole Tribe's contorted reliance on the Eleventh Amend-ment and its background was presumably unnecessary; the

Tenth would have done the work with an economy that the
majority in Seminole Tribe would have welcomed. Indeed,if the Court's current reasoning is correct, the Eleventh

Amendment itself was unnecessary. Whatever Article IIImay originally have said about the federal judicial power,
the embarrassment to the State of Georgia occasioned byattempts in federal court to enforce the State's war debt
could easily have been avoided if only the Court that decided
Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 419 (1793), had understood a
State's inherent, Tenth Amendment right to be free of any
judicial power, whether the court be state or federal, and
whether the cause of action arise under state or federal law.

The sequence of the Court's positions prompts a suspicion
of error, and skepticism is confirmed by scrutiny of the
Court's efforts to justify its holding. There is no evidence
that the Tenth Amendment constitutionalized a concept of
sovereign immunity as inherent in the notion of statehood,
and no evidence that any concept of inherent sovereign immunity was understood historically to apply when the sovereign sued was not the font of the law. Nor does the Court
fare any better with its subsidiary lines of reasoning, that
the state-court action is barred by the scheme of American
federalism, a result supposedly confirmed by a history
largely devoid of precursors to the action considered here.
The Court's federalism ignores the accepted authority of
Congress to bind States under the FLSA and to provide for
enforcement of federal rights in state court. The Court's
history simply disparages the capacity of the Constitution
to order relationships in a Republic that has changed since
the founding.

On each point the Court has raised it is mistaken, and I
respectfully dissent from its judgment.

762 ALDEN v. MAINE

Souter, J., dissenting

I
The Court rests its decision principally on the claim thatimmunity from suit was "a fundamental aspect of the sovereignty which the States enjoyed before the ratification ofthe Constitution,"

ante, at 713, an aspect which the Courtunderstands to have survived the ratification of the Constitution in 1788 and to have been "confirm[ed]" and given consti-tutional status,

ante, at 714, by the adoption of the Tenth
Amendment in 1791. If the Court truly means by "sovereign immunity" what that term meant at common law, see
ante, at 737, its argument would be insupportable. While
sovereign immunity entered many new state legal systemsas a part of the common law selectively received from England, it was not understood to be indefeasible or to have beengiven any such status by the new National Constitution,
which did not mention it. See Seminole Tribe, supra, at132-142, 160-162, and n. 55 (

Souter, J., dissenting). Had
the question been posed, state sovereign immunity could not
have been thought to shield a State from suit under federallaw on a subject committed to national jurisdiction by Article

I of the Constitution. Congress exercising its conceded Ar-ticle I power may unquestionably abrogate such immunity.
I set out this position at length in my dissent in Seminole
Tribe and will not repeat it here.1

The Court does not, however, offer today's holding as amere corollary to its reasoning in

Seminole Tribe, substituting the Tenth Amendment for the Eleventh as the occasion

1 The Court inexplicably protests that "the right to trial by jury and the
prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures . . . derive from the
common law," ante, at 733, but are nonetheless indefeasible. I cannot
imagine how this could be thought relevant to my argument. These
rights are constitutional precisely because they are enacted in the Sixth
and Fourth Amendments, respectively, while the general prerogative of
sovereign immunity appears nowhere in the Constitution. My point is
that the common law rights that were not enacted into the Constitution
were universally thought defeasible by statute.

demands, and it is fair to read its references to a "fundamental aspect" of state sovereignty as referring not to a prerogative inherited from the Crown, but to a conception necessarily implied by statehood itself. The conception is thus not
one of common law so much as of natural law, a universally
applicable proposition discoverable by reason. This, I take
it, is the sense in which the Court so emphatically relies on
Alexander Hamilton's reference in The Federalist No. 81,
p. 548 (J. Cooke ed. 1961), to the States' sovereign immunity
from suit as an "inherent" right, see ante, at 716, a characterization that does not require, but is at least open to, a natural
law reading.

I understand the Court to rely on the Hamiltonian formulation with the object of suggesting that its conception of
sovereign immunity as a "fundamental aspect" of sovereignty was a substantially popular, if not the dominant, view
in the periods of Revolution and Confederation. There is,
after all, nothing else in the Court's opinion that would suggest a basis for saying that the ratification of the Tenth
Amendment gave this "fundamental aspect" its constitutional status and protection against any legislative tampering by Congress.2 The Court's principal rationale for today's result, then, turns on history: was the natural law
conception of sovereign immunity as inherent in any notion
of an independent State widely held in the United States in
the period preceding the ratification of 1788 (or the adoption
of the Tenth Amendment in 1791)?

2 I am assuming that the Court does not put forward the theory of the
"fundamental aspect" as a newly derived conception of its own, necessarily
comprehended by the Tenth Amendment guarantee only as a result of
logic independent of any intention of the Framers. Nor does the Court
argue, and I know of no reason to suppose, that every legal advantage a
State might have enjoyed at common law was assumed to be an inherent
attribute of all sovereignties, or was constitutionalized wholesale by the
Tenth Amendment, any more than the Ninth Amendment constitutionalized all common law individual rights.

The answer is certainly no. There is almost no evidencethat the generation of the Framers thought sovereign immunity was fundamental in the sense of being unalterable.Whether one looks at the period before the framing, to the
ratification controversies, or to the early republican era, theevidence is the same. Some Framers thought sovereign immunity was an obsolete royal prerogative inapplicable in arepublic; some thought sovereign immunity was a common
law power defeasible, like other common law rights, by stat-ute; and perhaps a few thought, in keeping with a natural
law view distinct from the common law conception, that im-munity was inherent in a sovereign because the body that
made a law could not logically be bound by it. Natural lawthinking on the part of a doubtful few will not, however,
support the Court's position.

A
The American Colonies did not enjoy sovereign immunity,that being a privilege understood in English law to be reserved for the Crown alone; "antecedent to the Declarationof Independence, none of the colonies were, or pretended to
be, sovereign states," 1 J. Story, Commentaries on the Con-stitution $ 207, p. 149 (5th ed. 1891). Several colonial charters, including those of Massachusetts, Connecticut, RhodeIsland, and Georgia, expressly specified that the corporate
body established thereunder could sue and be sued. See 5Sources and Documents of United States Constitutions 36
(W. Swindler ed. 1975) (Massachusetts); 2 id., at 131 (Con-necticut); 8 id., at 363 (Rhode Island); 2 id., at 434 (Georgia).
Other charters were given to individuals, who were neces-sarily subject to suit. See Gibbons, The Eleventh Amendment and State Sovereign Immunity: A Reinterpretation, 83Colum. L. Rev. 1889, 1897 (1983). If a colonial lawyer had
looked into Blackstone for the theory of sovereign immunity,as indeed many did, he would have found nothing clearly
suggesting that the Colonies as such enjoyed any immunity

from suit. "[T]he law ascribes to the king the attribute of
sovereignty, or pre-eminence," said Blackstone, 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *241 (hereinafter Blackstone), and for
him, the sources for this notion were Bracton 3 and Acts of
Parliament that declared the Crown imperial, id., at *241-
*242. It was simply the King against whom "no suit or action can be brought . . . even in civil matters, because no
court can have jurisdiction over him." Id., at *242.4 If a

3 Bracton is the earliest source for the common law immunity of the
King, and his explanation is essentially practical: "Si autem ab eo petatur,
cum breve non currat contra ipsum, locus erit supplicationi, quod factum suum corrigat et emendet." That is, "If [justice] is asked of him,
since no writ runs against him there will [only] be opportunity for a petition, that he correct and amend his act." 2 Bracton, De Legibus et Consuetudinibus Angliae 33 (G. Woodbine ed., S. Thorne transl. 1968) (London
1569 ed., folio 5b, Bk. I, ch. 8). The fact that no writ ran against the King
was "no peculiar privilege; for no feudal lord could be sued in his own
court." 3 W. Holdsworth, History of English Law 465 (3d ed. 1927).
" `He can not be compelled to answer in his own court, but this is true of
every petty lord of every petty manor; that there happens to be in this
world no court above his court is, we may say, an accident.' " Nevada v.
Hall, 440 U. S. 410, 415, n. 6 (1979) (quoting 1 F. Pollock & F. Maitland,
History of English Law 518 (2d ed. 1899)). It was this same view of the
immunity that came down to Blackstone, who cited Finch for the view
that the King must be petitioned and not sued. See H. Finch, Law, or a
Discourse thereof, in Four Books 255 (1678 ed., reprinted 1992) ("Here in
place of action against the King petition must be made unto him in the
Chancery, or in Parliament, for no action did ever lie against the K[ing] at
the Common Law, but the party is driven to his petition" (footnotes omitted)); 1 Blackstone *242.

4 As I explain, infra, at 767-768, this common law conception of sovereign immunity differed from the natural law version, which understood
immunity as derived from the fact that the sovereign was the font of the
law, which could not bind him. I do not dispute, indeed I insist, that in
England it was the common law version that existed, and so it is beside
the point for the Court to protest that the King could not be sued under
French law in his own courts, see ante, at 735; naturally not, since the
common law conception was not couched in terms of who was the font of
the law. This said, I note that it is surprising for the Court to say that
"[i]t is doubtful whether the King was regarded . . . as the font of the

person should have "a just demand upon the king, he mustpetition him in his court of chancery, where his chancellor

will administer right as a matter of grace, though not uponcompulsion." Id., at *243.

It is worth pausing here to note that after Blackstone hadexplained sovereign immunity at common law, he went on
to say that the common law tradition was compatible withsovereign immunity as discussed by writers on "natural
law":

"And this is entirely consonant to what is laid down bythe writers on natural law. `A subject,' says Puffendorf,

`so long as he continues a subject, hath no way to obligehis prince to give him his due, when he refuses it;
though no wise prince will ever refuse to stand to a law-ful contract. And, if the prince gives the subject leave
to enter an action against him, upon such contract, inhis own courts, the action itself proceeds rather upon
natural equity, than upon the municipal laws.' For theend of such action is not to

compel the prince to observethe contract, but to persuade him." Ibid. (footnote

omitted).5
traditions and customs which formed the substance of the common law,"
ibid. Although Bracton said that "law makes the king," 2 Bracton, at 33,
he also said that the unwritten law of England could properly be called
law only to the extent that "the authority of the king or prince [has] first
been added thereto," id., at 19, and he spoke of "these English laws and
customs, by the authority of kings," id., at 21. The judges who announced
the common law sat "in the place of the king," id., at 20, and so in practice
the common law certainly derived from him. Thus, at least for the most
part, "[t]he custom of the king's court is the custom of England, and becomes the common law." 1 Pollock & Maitland, supra n. 3, at 184. But
for this, Blackstone would probably not have remarked that the natural
law theory produced a result "consonant" with the common law, 1 Blackstone *243; see infra this page and 768.

Next Blackstone quoted Locke's explanation for immunity,according to which the risks of overreaching by " `a heady

prince' " are " `well recompensed by the peace of the publicand security of the government, in the person of the chief
magistrate being thus set out of the reach of danger.' " Ibid.(quoting J. Locke, Second Treatise of Civil Government $ 205
(1690 J. Gough ed. 1947)). By quoting Pufendorf and Locke,Blackstone revealed to his readers a legal-philosophical tradition that derived sovereign immunity not from the im-memorial practice of England but from general theoretical
principles. But although Blackstone thus juxtaposed thecommon law and natural law

6 conceptions of sovereign imwhere in the same chapter, Pufendorf expressly derives the impossibility
of enforcing a King's promises against him from natural law theory:
"Therefore, since a king enjoys natural liberty, if he has discovered any
fault in a pact of his making, he can of his own authority serve notice upon
the other party that he refuses to be obligated by reason of that fault; nor
does he have to secure of the other [party to the pact] a release from a
thing [namely, the pact] which, of its own nature, is incapable of producing
an obligation or right." Id., at 1342-1343.

6 The Court says that to call its approach "natural law" is "an apparent

attempt to disparage," ante, at 758. My object, however, is not to call
names but to show that the majority is wrong, and in doing that it is
illuminating to explain the conceptual tradition on which today's majority
draws, one that can be traced to the Court's opinion from its origins in
Roman sources. I call this conception the "natural law" view of sovereign
immunity, despite the historical ambiguities associated with the term, because the expression by such figures as Pufendorf, Hobbes, and Locke, of
the doctrine that the sovereign might not be sued, was associated with
a concept of sovereignty itself derived from natural law. See Pufendorf
1103-1104; T. Hobbes, Leviathan Part 2, chs. 17-18 (1651), in 23 Great
Books of the Western World 99-104 (1952) (hereinafter Leviathan) (describing sovereignty as the result of surrender of individual natural rights
to single authority); J. Locke, Second Treatise of Civil Government

$$ 95-99 (1690 J. Gough ed. 1947) (describing political community formed
by individual consent out of a state of nature). The doctrine that the
sovereign could not be sued by his subjects might have been thought by
medieval civil lawyers to belong to jus gentium, the law of nations, which
was a type of natural law; or perhaps in its original form it might have
been understood as a precept of positive, written law. The earliest source

munity, he did not confuse them. It was as well he did not,for although the two conceptions were arguably "consonant"

in England, where according to Blackstone, the Crown wassovereign,

7 their distinct foundations could make a difference

in America, where the location of sovereignty was an issuethat independence would raise with some exigence.

B
Starting in the mid-1760's, ideas about sovereignty in colo-nial America began to shift as Americans argued that, lacking a voice in Parliament, they had not in any express wayconsented to being taxed. See B. Bailyn, The Ideological
Origins of the American Revolution 204-219 (1968); G. Wood,The Creati on of the American Republic, 1776-1787,
pp. 347-348 (1969). The story of the subsequent develop-ment of conceptions of sovereignty is complex and uneven;

for this conception is a statement of Ulpian's recorded in the Digest, I.3.31,
and much interpreted by medieval jurists, "Princeps legibus solutus est";
"The emperor is not bound by statutes." See 1 The Digest of Justinian
13 (T. Mommsen & P. Krueger eds., A. Watson transl. 1985); Tierney, The
Prince Is Not Bound by the Laws: Accursius and the Origins of the Modern State, 5 Comparative Studies in Society and History 378 (1963); K.
Pennington, The Prince and the Law, 1200-1600: Sovereignty and Rights
in the Western Legal Tradition 77-79 (1993). Through its reception and
discussion in the continental legal tradition, where it related initially to
the Emperor, but also eventually to a King, to the Pope, and even to a
city-state, see id., at 90, this conception of sovereign immunity developed
into a theoretical model applicable to any sovereign body. Thus Hobbes
could begin his discussion of the subject by saying, "The sovereign of a
Commonwealth, be it an assembly or one man, is not subject to the civil
laws." Leviathan, ch. 26, p. 130. There is debate on the degree to which
different medieval interpreters of the maxim Princeps legibus solutus est
understood natural or divine law to limit the prince's freedom from the
statutes. See Tierney, supra, at 390-394; Pennington, supra, at 206-208;
J. Canning, The Political Thought of Baldus de Ubaldis 74-79 (1987).

7 A better formulation would have clarified that sovereignty resided in

the King in Parliament, which was the dominant view by the later 17th
century. See, e. g., G. Wood, The Creation of the American Republic,
1776-1787, p. 347 (1969).

here, it is enough to say that by the time independence wasdeclared in 1776, the locus of sovereignty was still an open

question, except that almost by definition, advocates of inde-pendence denied that sovereignty with respect to the American Colonies remained with the King in Parliament.As the concept of sovereignty was unsettled, so was that
of sovereign immunity. Some States appear to have under-stood themselves to be without immunity from suit in their
own courts upon independence.8 Connecticut and Rhode Is-land adopted their pre-existing charters as constitutions,
without altering the provisions specifying their suability.See Gibbons, 83 Colum. L. Rev., at 1898, and nn. 42-43.
Other new States understood themselves to be inheritors ofthe Crown's common law sovereign immunity and so enacted
statutes authorizing legal remedies against the State parallelto those available in England.

9 There, although the Crown

8 The Court claims that the doctrine of sovereign immunity was "universal in the States when the Constitution was drafted and ratified," ante, at
715-716, but the examples of Connecticut and Rhode Island suggest that
this claim is overstated. It is of course true that these States' preservation without comment of their colonial suability could be construed merely
as a waiver of sovereign immunity, and not as a denial of the principle.
But in light of these States' silence as to any change in their status as
suable bodies, it would be tendentious so to understand it. The Court
relies for its claim on Justice Iredell's statement in Chisholm v. Georgia,
2 Dall. 419 (1793), that there was "no doubt" that no State had " `any
particular Legislative mode, authorizing a compulsory suit for the recovery of money against a State . . . either when the Constitution was
adopted, or at the time the judicial act was passed.' " Ante, at 716 (quoting Chisholm, supra, at 434-435). But as the cases of Rhode Island and
Connecticut demonstrate, Justice Iredell was simply wrong. As I have
had occasion to say elsewhere, that an assertion of historical fact has been
made by a Justice of the Court does not make it so. See Seminole Tribe
of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44, 107, n. 5 (1996) (dissenting opinion).

9 The Court seems to think I have overlooked this point, that the exceptions imply a rule, see ante, at 724 (provisions for chancery petitions "only
confir[m]" immunity enjoyed by these States). The reason for canvassing
the spectrum of state thought and practice is not to deny the undoubted
place of sovereign immunity in most States' courts, but to examine what

was immune from suit, the contemporary practice allowedprivate litigants to seek legal remedies against the Crown

through the petition of right or the monstrans de droit inthe Chancery or Exchequer. See 3 Blackstone *256-*257.
A Virginia statute provided:

" `Where the auditors according to their discretion andjudgment shall disallow or abate any article of demand

against the commonwealth, and any person shall thinkhimself aggrieved thereby, he shall be at liberty to petition the high court of chancery or the general court, ac-cording to the nature of his case, for redress, and such
court shall proceed to do right thereon; and a like peti-tion shall be allowed in all other cases to any other person who is entitled to demand against the common-wealth any right in law or equity.' " 9 W. Hening,
Statutes at Large: Being a Collection of the Laws ofVirginia 536, 540 (1821), quoted in Pfander, Sovereign
Immunity and the Right to Petition: Toward a FirstAmendment Right to Pursue Judicial Claims Against
the Government, 91 Nw. U. L. Rev. 899, 939-940, andn. 142 (1997).

This "petition" was clearly reminiscent of the English peti-tion of right, as was the language "shall proceed to do right
thereon," which paralleled the formula of royal approval,"

soit droit fait al partie," technically required before a peti-tion of right could be adjudicated. See 3 Blackstone *256;

Pfander, supra, at 940, and nn. 143-144. A New York stat-ute similarly authorized petition to the court of chancery by
anyone who thought himself aggrieved by the state auditorgeneral's resolution of his account with the State. See An
Act Directing a Mode for the Recovery of Debts Due to, andthe Settlement of Accounts with, this State, March 30, 1781,

turns out to be the scanty evidence that the States understood sovereign
immunity in the indefeasible, civilian, natural law sense, necessary to support the Court's position here.

Supreme Court of Pennsylvania did not reach this argument,
concluding on other grounds that it lacked jurisdiction.10Two years after this decision, under the influence of James

Wilson, see C. Jacobs, The Eleventh Amendment and Sovereign Immunity 25, and 169, n. 53 (1972), Pennsylvania
adopted a new constitution, which provided that "[s]uits may

direct." Pa. Const., Art. IX, $ 11 (1790), reprinted in 8

10 In a suit against Virginia in the Court of Common Pleas for Philadelphia County, Virginia pleaded sovereign immunity in natural law terms,
and the sheriff was excused from making return of the writ attaching
Virginia's goods, see Nathan v. Virginia, 1 Dall. 77, n. (1781), but this
was only after the Supreme Executive Council of the Commonwealth had
already ordered the goods returned and, in any event, involved the immunity of one State in the courts of another, and not the distinct immunity
of a State in her own courts, see Nevada v. Hall, 440 U. S., at 414.

11 Whether this formulation was a constitutional waiver of sovereign immunity or an affirmative repudiation of its applicability is uncertain, but
the broad language opening the courts to all suits, and the apparent desire
to exceed the previously available statutory scheme, would appear to support the latter interpretation.

Souter, J., dissenting
Around the time of the Constitutional Convention, then,there existed among the States some diversity of practice

with respect to sovereign immunity; but despite a tendencyamong the state constitutions to announce and declare certain inalienable and natural rights of men and even of thecollective people of a State, see,

e. g., Pennsylvania Constitu-tion, Art. III (1776), 8 Sources and Documents of United

States Constitutions, supra, at 278 ("That the people of thisState have the sole, exclusive and inherent right of governing and regulating the internal police of the same"), no Statedeclared that sovereign immunity was one of those rights.
To the extent that States were thought to possess immunity,it was perceived as a prerogative of the sovereign under
common law. And where sovereign immunity was recog-nized as barring suit, provisions for recovery from the State
were in order, just as they had been at common law inEngland.

C
At the Constitutional Convention, the notion of sovereignimmunity, whether as natural law or as common law, was not

an immediate subject of debate, and the sovereignty of aState in its own courts seems not to have been mentioned.
This comes as no surprise, for although the Constitution re-quired state courts to apply federal law, the Framers did not
consider the possibility that federal law might bind States,say, in their relations with their employees.

12 In the subse12 The Court says, "the Founders' silence is best explained by the simple
fact that no one, not even the Constitution's most ardent opponents,
suggested the document might strip States of the immunity." Ante, at
741. In fact, a stalwart supporter of the Constitution, James Wilson, laid
the groundwork for just such a view at the Pennsylvania Convention, see
infra, at 777-778. For the most part, it is true, the surviving records of
the ratifying conventions do not suggest that much thought was given to
the issue of suit against States in their own courts. But this silence does
not tell us that the Framers' generation thought the prerogative so well
settled as to be an inherent right of States, and not a common law creation.
It says only that at the conventions, the issue was not on the participants'

quent ratification debates, however, the issue of jurisdictionover a State did emerge in the question whether States

might be sued on their debts in federal court, and on thispoint, too, a variety of views emerged and the diversity of
sovereign immunity conceptions displayed itself.The only arguable support for the Court's absolutist view
that I have found among the leading participants in the de-bate surrounding ratification was the one already mentioned,
that of Alexander Hamilton in The Federalist No. 81, wherehe described the sovereign immunity of the States in language suggesting principles associated with natural law:

"It is inherent in the nature of sovereignty, not to beamenable to the suit of an individual without its consent.

This is the general sense and the general practice ofmankind; and the exemption, as one of the attributes of
sovereignty, is now enjoyed by the government of everystate in the union. Unless therefore, there is a surrender of this immunity in the plan of the convention, it willremain with the states, and the danger intimated [that
States might be sued on their debts in federal court]must be merely ideal. . . . The contracts between a
nation and individuals are only binding on the con-science of the sovereign, and have no pretensions to a
compulsive force. They confer no right of action inde-pendent of the sovereign will." The Federalist No. 81,
at 548-549.
Hamilton chose his words carefully, and he acknowledged thepossibility that at the Convention the States might have surrendered sovereign immunity in some circumstances, but thethrust of his argument was that sovereign immunity was "inherent in the nature of sovereignty." 13 An echo of Pufenminds because the nature of sovereignty was not always explicitly
addressed.

13 In Seminole Tribe, I explained that Hamilton had in mind state sovereign immunity only with respect to diversity cases applying state contract
law. See 517 U. S., at 145-149 (dissenting opinion). Here I intend simply

dorf may be heard in his reference to "the conscience of
the sovereign"; 14 and the universality of the phenomenon of
sovereign immunity, which Hamilton claimed ("the general
sense and the general practice of mankind"), is a peculiar
feature of the natural law conception. The apparent novelty
and uniqueness of Hamilton's employment of natural law terminology to explain the sovereign immunity of the States is
worth remarking, because it stands in contrast to formulations indicating no particular position on the natural-lawversus-common-law origin, to the more widespread view that
sovereign immunity derived from common law, and to the
more radical stance that the sovereignty of the people made
sovereign immunity out of place in the United States. Hamilton's view is also worth noticing because, in marked contrast to its prominence in the Court's opinion today, as well
as in Seminole Tribe, 517 U. S., at 54, and in Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U. S. 1, 13 (1890), cf. Great Northern Life Ins. Co.

to point out that with respect to state law, in the main Hamilton spoke
consistently with deriving sovereign immunity from a natural law model.
That he did so is consistent with his focus on state law; Hamilton almost
certainly knew that the natural law theory of sovereign immunity extended only to rights created by the sovereign, and so would not have
applied to federal-question claims against a State in either state or federal
court. Thus when the Court claims that subjecting States to suit in state
court "would turn on its head the concern of the founding generation--
that Article III might be used to circumvent state-court immunity," ante,
at 743, it has failed to realize that even those Framers who, like Hamilton,
aimed to preserve state sovereign immunity, had in mind only state immunity on state-law claims, not federal questions.

14 Pufendorf's discussion of sovereign immunity, just before the passage

quoted by Blackstone, begins (in a modern translation): "Now although
promises and pacts are as binding upon the conscience of a king as upon
that of any private citizen, there is, nevertheless, this difference between
the obligation of a king and that of subjects, namely, that it is no trouble
for the former to exact what is owed him from a subject, when he demurs,
while a citizen, so long as he remains such, has no means within his power
to recover his due from a king against his will." 2 Pufendorf 1344-1345.

v. Read, 322 U. S. 47, 51 (1944), it found no favor in the earlySupreme Court, see infra, at 781.

In the Virginia ratifying convention, Madison was amongthose who debated sovereign immunity in terms of the result
it produced, not its theoretical underpinnings. He main-tained that "[i]t is not in the power of individuals to call any
state into court," 3 Debates on the Federal Constitution 533(J. Elliot 2d ed. 1863) (hereinafter Elliot's Debates), and
thought that the phrase "in which a State shall be a Party"in Article III, $ 2, must be interpreted in light of that general
principle, so that "[t]he only operation it can have, is that, ifa state should wish to bring a suit against a citizen, it must
be brought before the federal court." Elliot's Debates 533.15John Marshall argued along the same lines against the possibility of federal jurisdiction over private suits against States,and he invoked the immunity of a State in its own courts in
support of his argument:

"I hope that no gentleman will think that a state will becalled at the bar of the federal court. Is there no such

case at present? Are there not many cases in which thelegislature of Virginia is a party, and yet the state is not
sued? It is not rational to suppose that the sovereignpower should be dragged before a court."

Id., at 555.

There was no unanimity among the Virginians either onstate- or federal-court immunity, however, for Edmund Randolph anticipated the position he would later espouse asplaintiff 's counsel in

Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 419 (1793).He contented himself with agnosticism on the significance of

what Hamilton had called "the general practice of mankind,"and argued that notwithstanding any natural law view of
the nonsuability of States, the Constitution permitted suitagainst a State in federal court: "I think, whatever the law

15 Madison seems here to have overlooked the possibility of concurrent
jurisdiction between the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction and that of
state courts.

of nations may say, that any doubt respecting the construction that a state may be plaintiff, and not defendant, is taken
away by the words where a state shall be a party." 3 Elliot's Debates 573. Randolph clearly believed that the Constitution both could, and in fact by its language did, trump
any inherent immunity enjoyed by the States; his view on
sovereign immunity in state court seems to have been that
the issue was uncertain ("whatever the law of nations may
say").

At the furthest extreme from Hamilton, James Wilson
made several comments in the Pennsylvania Convention that
suggested his hostility to any idea of state sovereign immunity. First, he responded to the argument that "the sovereignty of the states is destroyed" if they are sued by the
United States, "because a suiter in a court must acknowledge
the jurisdiction of that court, and it is not the custom of sovereigns to suffer their names to be made use of in this manner." 2 id., at 490. For Wilson, "[t]he answer [was] plain
and easy: the government of each state ought to be subordinate to the government of the United States." Ibid.16 Wil16 The Court says this statement of Wilson's is "startling even today,"
ante, at 725, but it is hard to see what is so startling, then or now, about
the proposition that, since federal law may bind state governments, the
state governments are in this sense subordinate to the national. The
Court seems to have forgotten that one of the main reasons a Constitutional Convention was necessary at all was that under the Articles of Confederation Congress lacked the effective capacity to bind the States. The
Court speaks as if the Supremacy Clause did not exist or McCulloch v.
Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316 (1819), had never been decided.

Nor is the Court correct to say that the views of Wilson, Randolph, and
General Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, see n. 17, infra, "cannot bear the
weight" I put upon them, ante, at 725. Indeed, the yoke is light, since I
intend these Framers only to do their part in showing that a diversity of
views with respect to sovereignty and sovereign immunity existed at the
several state conventions, and that this diversity stands in the way of the
Court's assumption that the founding generation understood sovereign

Souter, J., dissenting
son was also pointed in commenting on federal jurisdiction
over cases between a State and citizens of another State:
"When this power is attended to, it will be found to be a
necessary one. Impartiality is the leading feature in this
Constitution; it pervades the whole. When a citizen has a
controversy with another state, there ought to be a tribunal
where both parties may stand on a just and equal footing."
Id., at 491. Finally, Wilson laid out his view that sovereignty was in fact not located in the States at all: "Upon
what principle is it contended that the sovereign power resides in the state governments? The honorable gentleman
has said truly, that there can be no subordinate sovereignty.
Now, if there cannot, my position is, that the sovereignty
resides in the people; they have not parted with it; they have
only dispensed such portions of the power as were conceived
necessary for the public welfare." Id., at 443.17 While this

immunity in the natural law sense as indefeasibly "fundamental" to
statehood.

Finally, the Court calls Wilson's view "a radical nationalist vision of the
constitutional design," ibid., apparently in an attempt to discount it. But
while Wilson's view of sovereignty was indeed radical in its deviation from
older conceptions, this hardly distanced him from the American mainstream, and in October 1787, Washington himself called Wilson "as able,
candid, & honest a member as any in Convention," 5 Papers of George
Washington: Confederation Series 379 (W. Abbot & D. Twohig eds. 1997).

17 Nor was Wilson alone in this theory. At the South Carolina Convention, General Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, who had attended the Philadelphia Convention, took the position that the States never enjoyed
individual and unfettered sovereignty, because the Declaration of Independence was an act of the Union, not of the particular States. See 4
Elliot's Debates 301. In his view, the Declaration "sufficiently confutes
the . . . doctrine of the individual sovereignty and independence of the
several states. . . . The separate independence and individual sovereignty
of the several states were never thought of by the enlightened band of
patriots who framed this Declaration; the several states are not even mentioned by name in any part of it,--as if it was intended to impress this
maxim on America, that our freedom and independence arose from our

statement did not specifically address sovereign immunity, itexpressed the major premise of what would later become

Justice Wilson's position in Chisholm: that because the peo-ple, and not the States, are sovereign, sovereign immunity
has no applicability to the States.From a canvass of this spectrum of opinion expressed at
the ratifying conventions, one thing is certain. No one wasespousing an indefeasible, natural law view of sovereign immunity. The controversy over the enforceability of statedebts subject to state law produced emphatic support for
sovereign immunity from eminences as great as Madison andMarshall, but neither of them indicated adherence to any immunity conception outside the common law.

D
At the close of the ratification debates, the issue of thesovereign immunity of the States under Article III had not

been definitively resolved, and in some instances the indeter-minacy led the ratification conventions to respond in ways
that point to the range of thinking about the doctrine. Sev-eral state ratifying conventions proposed amendments and
issued declarations that would have exempted States fromsubjection to suit in federal court.

footnote, Tucker specified that "[t]he several conventions of Massachusetts,
New Hampshire, Rhode Island, New York, Virginia, and North Carolina,
proposed amendments in this respect." Ibid. The proposed amendments of the latter four States, which may be found in Elliot's Debates, are
discussed immediately infra this page and 779-781. The extant published
versions of the proposed amendments of Massachusetts and New Hampshire do not include such a proposed amendment. See, e. g., 1 Elliot's

tion's statement of ratification included a series of declara-tions framed as proposed amendments, among which was one

stating "That the judicial power of the United States, incases in which a state may be a party, does not extend to
criminal prosecutions, or to authorize any suit by any personagainst a state." 1 Elliot's Debates 329.

19 Whether that

amendment was meant to alter or to clarify Article III asratified is uncertain, but regardless of its precise intent, New

York's response to the draft proposed by the Convention of1787 shows that there was no consensus at all on the question
of state suability (let alone on the underlying theory ofimmunity doctrine). There was, rather, an unclear state of
affairs which it seemed advisable to stabilize.The Rhode Island Convention, when it finally ratified on
June 16, 1790, called upon its representatives to urge thepassage of a list of amendments. This list incorporated language, some of it identical to that proposed by New York, inthe following form:

"It is declared by the Convention, that the judicialpower of the United States, in cases in which a state
may be a party, does not extend to criminal prosecu-tions, or to authorize any suit by any person against a
state; but, to remove all doubts or controversies respect(same); 1 Elliot's Debates 325-326 (12 proposed amendments of New
Hampshire); H. R. Doc. No. 398, supra, at 1025-1026 (same).

19 It is conceivable that the New York Convention, which was after all

the intended audience for The Federalist, thought that the States had
some sort of an inherent right against being sued in federal court. But
this is unlikely, because numerous other of the proposed amendments declared so-called "rights" in no uncertain terms, see, e. g., 1 Elliot's Debates
328 ("[T]he people have an equal, natural, and unalienable right freely and
peaceably to exercise their religion"; trial by jury is "one of the greatest
securities to the rights of a free people"; "[T]he people have a right peaceably to assemble together"), whereas the proposed amendment regarding
suits against States simply stated that the judicial power "does not
extend . . . to authorize any suit by any person against a state," and said
nothing about any rights, inherent or otherwise. Id., at 329.

ing the same, that it be especially expressed, as a partof the Constitution of the United States, that Congress

shall not, directly or indirectly, either by themselves orthrough the judiciary, interfere with any one of the
states . . . in liquidating and discharging the public secu-rities of any one state."

Id., at 336.

Even more clearly than New York's proposal, this amend-ment appears to have been intended to clarify Article III as

reflecting some theory of sovereign immunity, though with-out indicating which one.

Unlike the Rhode Island proposal, which hinted at a clari-fication of Article III, the Virginia and North Carolina ratifying conventions proposed amendments that by their termswould have fundamentally altered the content of Article III.
The Virginia Convention's proposal for a new Article IIIomitted entirely the language conferring federal jurisdiction
over a controversy between a State and citizens of anotherState, see 3 id., at 660-661, and the North Carolina Convention proposed an identical amendment, see 4 id., at 246-247.These proposals for omission suggest that the conventions
of Virginia and North Carolina thought they had subjectedthemselves to citizen suits under Article III as enacted, and
that they wished not to have done so.20 There is, thus, nosuggestion in their resolutions that Article III as drafted
was fundamentally at odds with an indefeasible natural lawsovereignty, or with a conception that went to the essence of
what it meant to be a State. At all events, the state ratify-ing conventions' felt need for clarification on the question of

20 The Court says "there is no evidence that [the proposed amendments]
were directed toward the question of sovereign immunity or that they
reflect an understanding that the States would be subject to private suits
without consent under Article III as drafted." Ante, at 725. No evidence, that is, except the proposed amendments themselves, which would
have omitted the Citizen-State Diversity Clause. If the proposed omission is not evidence going to sovereign immunity to private suits, one
wonders what would satisfy the Court.

state suability demonstrates that uncertainty surroundedthe matter even at the moment of ratification. This uncertainty set the stage for the divergent views expressed inChisholm.

E
If the natural law conception of sovereign immunity as aninherent characteristic of sovereignty enjoyed by the States

had been broadly accepted at the time of the founding, onewould expect to find it reflected somewhere in the five opinions delivered by the Court in Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall.419 (1793). Yet that view did not appear in any of them.
And since a bare two years before Chisholm, the Bill ofRights had been added to the original Constitution, if the
Tenth Amendment had been understood to give federal con-stitutional status to state sovereign immunity so as to endue
it with the equivalent of the natural law conception, onewould be certain to find such a development mentioned
somewhere in the Chisholm writings. In fact, however, notone of the opinions espoused the natural law view, and not
one of them so much as mentioned the Tenth Amendment.Not even Justice Iredell, who alone among the Justices
thought that a State could not be sued in federal court,echoed Hamilton or hinted at a constitutionally immutable
immunity doctrine.Chisholm presented the questions whether a State might
be made a defendant in a suit brought by a citizen of anotherState, and if so, whether an action of assumpsit would lie
against it. See id., at 420 (questions presented).21 In rep21 The case had first been brought before the Federal Circuit Court for
the District of Georgia, over which Justice Iredell and District Judge Nathaniel Pendleton had presided. Ultimately, Justice Iredell held that the
Circuit Court had no jurisdiction in the case because Congress had not
conferred such jurisdiction on it. See 5 Documentary History of the Supreme Court of the United States, 1789-1800, pp. 128-129, 154 (M. Marcus
ed. 1994). Georgia had maintained that it was "a free, sov[e]reign, and
independent State, and . . . cannot be drawn or compelled, nor at any Time

resenting Chisholm, Edmund Randolph, the Framer 22 and
then Attorney General, not only argued for the necessity of
a federal forum to vindicate private rights against the
States, see id., at 422, but rejected any traditional conception
of sovereignty. He said that the sovereignty of the States,
which he acknowledged, id., at 423, was no barrier to jurisdiction, because "the present Constitution produced a new
order of things. It derives its origin immediately from the
people . . . . The States are in fact assemblages of these
individuals who are liable to process," ibid.

Justice Wilson took up the argument for the sovereignty
of the people more vociferously. Building on a conception of
sovereignty he had already expressed at the Pennsylvania

past hath been accustomed to be, or could be drawn or compelled to answer against the will of the said State of Georgia, before any Justices of
the federal Circuit Court for the District of Georgia or before any Justices
of any Court of Law or Equity whatever." Plea to the Jurisdiction, Oct.
17, 1791, id., at 143. Chisholm demurred to the plea on the apparent
ground that while the plea alleged that Georgia could not be compelled to
appear before any court, Article III expressly declared that the federal
judicial power extended to all controversies between a State and citizens
of another State. Demurrer, id., at 144. In his unreported opinion, Justice Iredell dispensed with this demurrer. He first stated that the plea
sufficiently alleged that the District Court lacked jurisdiction. Id., at 150.
He added that in any case, the existence of Congress's constitutional authority to create courts to hear controversies between a State and citizens
of another State did not mean that Congress had in fact created such
courts. Id., at 151. Third, Justice Iredell pointed out that the right to
create courts for cases in which a State was a party did not mean that
Congress could confer jurisdiction in cases like the one at bar, because the
word "controversies" in Article III might refer only to situations "where
such controversies could formerly have been maintained" in state court.
Since "under the jurisdiction of a particular State Sovereigns may be liable in some instances but not in others," just as "[i]n England the property
in possession of the crown can be affected by an adverse Process, tho'
certainly the King cannot be sued for the recovery of a sum of money,"
ibid., it appeared to Justice Iredell that under some conditions Article III
did not authorize suits against States.

ratifying convention, see supra, at 777-778, he began by not-ing what he took to be the pregnant silence of the Constitution regarding sovereignty:

"To the Constitution of the United States the termSOVEREIGN, is totally unknown. There is but one

place where it could have been used with propriety.But, even in that place it would not, perhaps, have
comported with the delicacy of those, who ordainedand established that Constitution. They might have
announced themselves `SOVEREIGN' people of theUnited States: But serenely conscious of the fact, they
avoided the ostentatious declaration." 2 Dall., at 454.
As if to contrast his own directness 23 with the Framers' deli-cacy, the Framer-turned-Justice explained in no uncertain

terms that Georgia was not sovereign with respect to federaljurisdiction (even in a diversity case):

"As a Judge of this Court, I know, and can decide uponthe knowledge, that the citizens of

Georgia, when theyacted upon the large scale of the Union, as a part of

the `People of the United States,' did not surrender theSupreme or sovereign Power to that State; but, as to

23 Justice Wilson hinted that in his own private view, citizens of the
States had not conferred sovereignty in the sense of absolute authority
upon their state governments, because they had retained some rights to
themselves: "[A]ccording to some writers, every State, which governs
itself without any dependence on another power, is a sovereign State.
Whether, with regard to her own citizens, this is the case of the State of
Georgia; whether those citizens have done, as the individuals of England
are said, by their late instructors, to have done, surrendered the Supreme
Power to the State or Government, and reserved nothing to themselves;
or whether, like the people of other States, and of the United States, the
citizens of Georgia have reserved the Supreme Power in their own hands;
and on that Supreme Power have made the State dependent, instead of
being sovereign; these are questions, to which, as a Judge in this cause,
I can neither know nor suggest the proper answers; though, as a citizen
of the Union, I know, and am interested to know, that the most satisfactory answers can be given." Chisholm, 2 Dall., at 457 (citation omitted).

the purposes of the Union, retained it to themselves.As to the purposes of the Union, therefore, Georgia is

NOT a sovereign State." Id., at 457.
This was necessarily to reject any natural law conception ofsovereign immunity as inherently attached to an American

State, but this was not all. Justice Wilson went on to iden-tify the origin of sovereign immunity in the feudal system
that had, he said, been brought to England and to the com-mon law by the Norman Conquest. After quoting Blackstone's formulation of the doctrine as it had developed inEngland, he discussed it in the most disapproving terms
imaginable:

"This last position [that the King is sovereign and nocourt can have jurisdiction over him] is only a branch

of a much more extensive principle, on which a plan ofsystematic despotism has been lately formed in

Eng-land, and prosecuted with unwearied assiduity and care.

Of this plan the author of the Commentaries was, if notthe introducer, at least the great supporter. He has
been followed in it by writers later and less known; andhis doctrines have, both on the other and

this side of theAtlantic, been implicitly and generally received by those,

who neither examined their principles nor their conse-quences[.] The principle is, that all human law must be
prescribed by a superior. This principle I mean notnow to examine. Suffice it, at present to say, that another principle, very different in its nature and opera-tions, forms, in my judgment, the basis of sound and
genuine jurisprudence; laws derived from the puresource of equality and justice must be founded on the
CONSENT of those, whose obedience they require.The

sovereign, when traced to his source, must be foundin the

man." Id., at 458.

With this rousing conclusion of revolutionary ideology andrhetoric, Justice Wilson left no doubt that he thought the

527US2 Unit: $U91 [05-09-01 13:08:16] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Souter, J., dissenting
doctrine of sovereign immunity entirely anomalous in theAmerican Republic. Although he did not speak specifically

of a State's immunity in its own courts, his view necessarilyrequires that such immunity would not have been justifiable
as a tenet of absolutist natural law.

Chief Justice Jay took a less vehement tone in his opinion,but he, too, denied the applicability of the doctrine of sovereign immunity to the States. He explained the doctrine asan incident of European feudalism,

id., at 471, and said that
by contrast,

"[n]o such ideas obtain here; at the Revolution, the sovereignty devolved on the people; and they are truly thesovereigns of the country, but they are

sovereigns without subjects (unless the African slaves among us maybe so called) and have none to govern but

themselves;
the citizens of America are equal as fellow citizens, andas joint tenants in the sovereignty."

Id., at 471-472.

From the difference between the sovereignty of princes andthat of the people, Chief Justice Jay argued, it followed that

a State might be sued. When a State sued another State,as all agreed it could do in federal court, all the people of one
State sued all the people of the other. "But why it should bemore incompatible, that all the people of a State should be
sued by one citizen, than by one hundred thousand, I cannot
perceive, the process in both cases being alike; and the conse-quences of a judgment alike."

Id., at 473. Finally, Chief
Justice Jay pointed out, Article III authorized suits betweena State and citizens of another State. Although the Chief

Justice reserved judgment on whether the United States
might be sued by a citizen, given that the courts must rely
on the Executive to implement their decisions, he made it
clear that this reservation was practical, and not theoretical:
"I wish the State of society was so far improved, and the
science of Government advanced to such a degree of perfection, as that the whole nation could in the peaceable course

of law, be compelled to do justice, and be sued by individualcitizens."

Id., at 478. Although Chief Justice Jay did not
speak specifically to the question of state sovereign immu-nity in state court, his theory shows that he considered not

the States, but the people collectively, to be sovereign; and
there is thus no reason to think he would have denied thatthe people of the Nation could override any state claim to

sovereign immunity in a matter committed to the Nation.Justice Cushing's opinion relied on the express language
of Article III to hold that Georgia might be sued in federalcourt. He dealt shortly with the objection that States' sovereignty would be thereby restricted so that States would
be reduced to corporations: "As to corporations, all States
whatever are corporations or bodies politic. The only question is, what are their powers?" Id., at 468. Observing
that the Constitution limits the powers of the States in numerous ways, he concluded that "no argument of force can
be taken from the sovereignty of States. Where it has been
abridged, it was thought necessary for the greater indispensable good of the whole." Ibid. From the opinion, it is not
possible to tell with certainty what Justice Cushing thought
about state sovereign immunity in state court, although his
introductory remark is suggestive. The case, he wrote,
"turns not upon the law or practice of England, although
perhaps it may be in some measure elucidated thereby, nor
upon the law of any other country whatever; but upon the
Constitution established by the people of the United States."
Id., at 466. It is clear that he had no sympathy for a view
of sovereign immunity inherent in statehood and untouchable by national legislative authority.

Justice Blair, like Justice Cushing, relied on Article III,
and his brief opinion shows that he acknowledged state sovereign immunity, but common law immunity in state court.
First, Justice Blair asked hypothetically whether a verdict
against the plaintiff would be preclusive if the plaintiff
"should renew his suit against the State, in any mode in

527US2 Unit: $U91 [05-09-01 13:08:16] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Souter, J., dissenting
which she may permit herself to be sued in her own Courts."Id., at 452. Second, he commented that there was no need

to require the plaintiff to proceed by way of petition:

"When sovereigns are sued in their own Courts, such amethod may have been established as the most respectful form of demand; but we are not now in a State-Court;and if sovereignty be an exemption from suit in any
other than the sovereign's own Courts, it follows thatwhen a State, by adopting the Constitution, has agreed
to be amenable to the judicial power of the UnitedStates, she has, in that respect, given up her right of
sovereignty." Ibid.
It is worth noting that for Justice Blair, the petition broughtin state court was properly called a suit. This reflects the

contemporary practice of his native Virginia, where, as wehave seen,

supra, at 769, suits as of right against the Statewere authorized by statute. Justice Blair called sovereignty

"an exemption from suit in any other than the sovereign'sown Courts" because he assumed that, in its own courts, a
sovereign will naturally permit itself to be sued as of right.Justice Iredell was the only Member of the Court to hold
that the suit could not lie; but if his discussion was far-reaching, his reasoning was cautious. Its core was that the
Court could not assume a waiver of the State's common lawsovereign immunity where Congress had not expressly
passed such a waiver. See 2 Dall., at 449 (dissenting opin-ion). Although Justice Iredell added, in what he clearly
identified as dictum, that he was "strongly against" any con-struction of the Constitution "which will admit, under any
circumstances, a compulsive suit against a State for the re-covery of money," ibid.,

24 he made it equally clear that he

understood sovereign immunity as a common law doctrine
passed to the States with independence:

"No other part of the common law of England, it appears to me, can have any reference to this subject, but
that part of it which prescribes remedies against the
crown. Every State in the Union in every instance
where its sovereignty has not been delegated to the
United States, I consider to be as compleatly sovereign,
as the United States are in respect to the powers surrendered. The United States are sovereign as to all the
powers of Government actually surrendered: Each State
in the Union is sovereign as to all the powers reserved.
It must necessarily be so, because the United States
have no claim to any authority but such as the States

diction from one tribunal to another, or as authorizing the Legislature to
provide laws for the decision of all possible controversies in which a State
may be involved with an individual, without regard to any prior exemption." Id., at 436. Justice Iredell seems to have believed that Article III
authorized only the former; in other words, that the Framers intended to
permit Article III jurisdiction in suits against a State only where some
other existing court could also hear such a claim. Because in Justice Iredell's view, state courts could nowhere hear suits against a State at the
time of ratification, see id., at 434-435, it followed that Article III probably
did not authorize such suits. Justice Iredell's reasoning, it must be said,
differed markedly from the reasoning the Court adopts today. Justice
Iredell believed simply that the Clause in Article III extending jurisdiction to controversies between a State and citizens of another State did not
confer any extra lawmaking authority on Congress that was not found
elsewhere in the Constitution. Because he could conceive of no other constitutional provision authorizing Congress to create a private right of action against a State, he concluded that none could exist. Today, of course,
it is established that the commerce power authorizes Congress to create
private rights as against the States. See Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U. S. 528 (1985). The Court today takes
the altogether different tack of arguing that state immunity from suit
in state court was an inherent right of States preserved by the Tenth
Amendment. Whatever Justice Iredell might have thought of this argument, it gets no support from his opinion.

have surrendered to them: Of course the part not sur-renderred must remain as it did before." Id., at 435.

This did not mean, of course, that the States had not dele-gated to Congress the power to subject them to suit, but
merely that such a delegation would have been necessary onJustice Iredell's view.

In sum, then, in Chisholm two Justices (Jay and Wilson),one of whom had been present at the Constitutional Convention, took a position suggesting that States should not enjoysovereign immunity (however conceived) even in their own
courts; one (Cushing) was essentially silent on the issue ofsovereign immunity in state court; one (Blair) took a cautious
position affirming the pragmatic view that sovereign immu-nity was a continuing common law doctrine and that States
would permit suit against themselves as of right; and one(Iredell) expressly thought that state sovereign immunity at
common law rightly belonged to the sovereign States. Nota single Justice suggested that sovereign immunity was an
inherent and indefeasible right of statehood, and neithercounsel for Georgia before the Circuit Court, see n. 21,
supra, nor Justice Iredell seems even to have conceived thepossibility that the new Tenth Amendment produced the
equivalent of such a doctrine. This dearth of support makesit very implausible for today's Court to argue that a substantial (let alone a dominant) body of thought at the time ofthe framing understood sovereign immunity to be an inherent right of statehood, adopted or confirmed by the TenthAmendment.

25 It only makes matters worse for the Court that two States, New York
and Maryland, voluntarily subjected themselves to suit in the Supreme
Court around the time of Chisholm. See Marcus & Wexler, Suits Against
States: Diversity of Opinion in the 1790s, 1993 J. Sup. Ct. Hist. 73,
74-78. At the Court's February Term, 1791, before Chisholm, Maryland
entered a plea (probably as to the merits) in Van Staphorst v. Maryland,
see 1993 J. Sup. Ct. Hist., at 74, a suit brought by a foreign citizen for debts
owed by the State, but then settled the suit to avoid the establishment of

The Court's discomfort is evident in its obvious recognitionthat its natural law or Tenth Amendment conception of state

sovereign immunity is insupportable if Chisholm stands.Hence the Court's attempt to discount the Chisholm opinions, an enterprise in which I believe it fails.The Court, citing

Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U. S. 1 (1890),says that the Eleventh Amendment "overruled" Chisholm,

ante, at 723, but the animadversion is beside the point. Thesignificance of Chisholm is its indication that in 1788 and
1791 it was not generally assumed (indeed, hardly assumedat all) that a State's sovereign immunity from suit in its own
courts was an inherent, and not merely a common law, advantage. On the contrary, the testimony of five eminentlegal minds of the day confirmed that virtually everyone who

understood immunity to be legitimate saw it as a commonlaw prerogative (from which it follows that it was subject
to abrogation by Congress as to a matter within Congress'sArticle I authority).

The Court does no better with its trio of arguments toundercut

Chisholm's legitimacy: that the Chisholm majority
"failed to address either the practice or the understanding
that prevailed in the States at the time the Constitution wasadopted,"

ante, at 721; that "the majority suspected the decision would be unpopular and surprising," ibid.; and that"two Members of the majority acknowledged that the United

States might well remain immune from suit despite" ArticleIII,

ante, at 722. These three claims do not, of course, go to
the question whether state sovereign immunity was under-stood to be "fundamental" or "inherent," but in any case,

none of them is convincing.
an adverse precedent on immunity, see id., at 75. In Oswald v. New York,
an action that commenced before Chisholm but that was continued after
it, New York initially objected to jurisdiction, see 1993 J. Sup. Ct. Hist.,
at 77, but the suit was tried to a jury in the Supreme Court, and after
New York lost, it paid the full jury verdict out of the State's treasury, id.,
at 78.

With respect to the first, Justice Blair in fact did expresslyrefer to the practice of state sovereign immunity in state

court, and acknowledged the petition of right as an appro-priate and normal practice. This aside, the Court would
have a legitimate point if it could show that the Chisholm
majority took insufficient account of a body of practice thatsomehow indicated a widely held absolutist conception of

state sovereign immunity untouchable and untouched by theConstitution. But of course it cannot.

26

As for the second point, it is a remarkable doctrine thatwould hold anticipation of unpopularity the benchmark of

constitutional error. In any event, the evidence profferedby the Court is merely this: that Justice Wilson thought the
prerevolutionary conception of sovereignty misguided, 2Dall., at 454-455; that Justice Cushing stated axiomatically
that the Constitution could always be amended, id., at 468;
that Chief Justice Jay noted that the losing defendant might
still come to understand that sovereign immunity is inconsistent with republicanism, id., at 478-479; and that Attorney

26 The Court thinks that Justice Iredell's adversion to state practice
gives reason to think so, see ante, at 721 ("[D]espite the opinion of Justice
Iredell, the majority failed to address . . ."). Even if Justice Iredell had
been right about state practice, failure to respond to a specific argument
raised by another Justice (as opposed to counsel) has even less significance
with respect to this early Supreme Court opinion than it would have today,
because the Justices may not have afforded one another the opportunity
to read their opinions before they were announced. See 1 J. Goebel, The
Oliver Wendell Holmes Devise: History of the Supreme Court of the
United States, Antecedents and Beginnings to 1801, p. 728 (1971) ("There
are hints . . . that there may have been no conference and that each Justice
arrived at his conclusion independently without knowing what each of his
brethren had decided"). Indeed, since "opinions were given only orally
in the Supreme Court in the 1790s," 5 Documentary History of the Supreme Court, supra n. 21, at 164, n., it is possible that the opinion as
reported by Dallas followed a document prepared by Wilson after the oral
announcement of the opinion, ibid.; see also id., at xxiv-xxv, in which case
it is possible that the other Justices never heard certain arguments until
publication.

General Randolph admitted that the position he espousedwas unpopular not only in Georgia, but also in another State,

probably Virginia.27 These items boil down to the proposi-tion that the Justices knew (as who could not, with such a
case before him) that at the ratifying conventions the sig-nificance of sovereign immunity had been, as it still was, a
matter of dispute. This reality does not detract from, butconfirms, the view that the Framers showed no intent to recognize sovereign immunity as an immutably inherent powerof the States.

As to the third objection, that two Justices noted that theUnited States might possess sovereign immunity notwithstanding Article III, I explained, supra, at 785-786, thatChief Justice Jay thought this possibility was purely practical, not at all legal, and without any implication for stateimmunity vis-a` -vis federal claims. Justice Cushing was so
little troubled by the possibility he raised that he wrote, "Ifthis be a necessary consequence, it must be so," Chisholm,
supra, at 469, and simply suggested a textual reading thatmight have led to a different consequence.

Nor can the Court make good on its claim that the enact-ment of the Eleventh Amendment retrospectively reestablished the view that had already been established at the timeof the framing (though eluding the perception of all but one
Member of the Supreme Court), and hence "acted . . . torestore the original constitutional design,"

ante, at 722.28

27 The circumlocution "another State, whose will must be always dear to
me," Chisholm, 2 Dall., at 419, hints at Randolph's home State. It seems
odd to suggest that Randolph's acknowledgment of the unpopularity of his
position in two States would somehow support the thought that the view
was incorrect. Randolph himself had urged the same position at the Virginia ratifying convention, see supra, at 775-776, and so knew perfectly
well that Virginia had ratified with full knowledge that his position might
be the law.

28 It is interesting to note a case argued in the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in 1798, in which counsel for the Commonwealth urged a version
of the point that the Court makes here, and said that "[t]he language of
the amendment, indeed, does not import an alteration of the Constitution,

There was nothing "established" about the position espousedby Georgia in the effort to repudiate its debts, and the

Court's implausible suggestion to the contrary merely echoesthe brio of its remark in Seminole Tribe that Chisholm was
"contrary to the well-understood meaning of the Constitu-tion." 517 U. S., at 69 (citing

Principality of Monaco v.Mississippi, 292 U. S. 313, 325 (1934)). The fact that Chisholm was no conceptual aberration is apparent from the rati-fication debates and the several state requests to rewrite
Article III. There was no received view either of the rolethis sovereign immunity would play in the circumstances of
the case or of a conceptual foundation for immunity doctrineat odds with

Chisholm's reading of Article III. As an au-thor on whom the Court relies, see ante, at 724, has it, "there

was no unanimity among the Framers that immunity wouldexist," D. Currie, The Constitution in the Supreme Court:

but an authoritative declaration of its true construction." Respublica v.
Cobbet, 3 Dall. 467, 472 (1798). The court expressly repudiated the historical component of this claim in an opinion by its Chief Justice: "When the
judicial law [i. e., the Judiciary Act of 1789] was passed, the opinion prevailed that States might be sued, which by this amendment is settled otherwise." Id., at 475 (M'Kean, C. J.).

29 The Court might perhaps respond that if the role of state sovereign

immunity was not the subject of universal consensus in 1792, the enactment of the Eleventh Amendment brought the doctrine into the constitutional realm. The strongest form of this view must maintain that, notwithstanding the Amendment's silence regarding state courts and its
exclusive focus on the federal judicial power, the motivation of the framers of the Eleventh Amendment must have been affirmatively to embrace
the position that the States enjoyed the immunity from suit previously
enjoyed by the Crown. On this account, the framers of the Eleventh
Amendment said nothing about sovereign immunity in state court because
it never occurred to them that such immunity could be questioned; had
they thought of this possibility, they would have considered it absurd that
States immune in federal court could be subjected to suit in their own
courts.

The first trouble with this view is that it assumes that the Eleventh
Amendment was intended to reach all federal-law suits, and not only those
arising under diversity jurisdiction. If the framers of the Eleventh

It should not be surprising, then, to realize that although
much post-Chisholm discussion was disapproving (as the
States saw their escape from debt cut off), the decision had
champions "every bit as vigorous in defending their interpretation of the Constitution as were those partisans on the
other side of the issue." Marcus & Wexler, Suits Against
States: Diversity of Opinion In The 1790s, 1993 J. Sup. Ct.
Hist. 73, 83; see, e. g., 5 Documentary History of the Supreme
Court, supra n. 21, at 251-252, 252-253, 262-264, 268-269
(newspaper articles supporting holding in Chisholm); 5 Documentary History of the Supreme Court, supra, at 616
(statement of a committee of Delaware Senate in support
of holding in Chisholm). The federal citizen-state diversity
jurisdiction was settled by the Eleventh Amendment; Article
III was not "restored."

Amendment had in mind only diversity cases, as the Court was prepared
to concede in Seminole Tribe, see 517 U. S., at 69-70 ("The text dealt in
terms only with the problem presented by the decision in Chisholm . . . .
[I]t seems unlikely that much thought was given to the prospect of
federal-question jurisdiction over the States"), then it might plausibly follow that the framers of that Amendment assumed that States possessed
sovereign immunity in their own courts with respect to state law. But it
certainly does not follow that the Amendment's authors would have
thought that States enjoyed immunity in state court on questions of federal law. To accept this would require one to believe that the framers of
the Eleventh Amendment were blind to an extremely anomalous application of sovereign immunity, under which a State is immune even when it
is not the font of the law under which it is sued, cf. infra, at 797-798, 800.
The Court today may labor under the misapprehension that sovereign immunity can apply where the sovereign is not the font of law, but the Court
adduces no evidence to suggest that the framers of the Eleventh Amendment held such a view. And the framers were much closer than the Court
to the theory of sovereign immunity according to which the font of law
may not be subject to suit under that law. This leaves the Court in the
position of supporting its view of what the Eleventh Amendment means
by the "historical" assertion that the framers must have intended it to
mean the same.

It is clear enough that the Court has no historical predicate to argue for a fundamental or inherent theory of sover-eign immunity as limiting authority elsewhere conferred by

the Constitution or as imported into the Constitution by theTenth Amendment. But what if the facts were otherwise
and a natural law conception of state sovereign immunity ina State's own courts were implicit in the Constitution? On
good authority, it would avail the State nothing, and theCourt would be no less mistaken than it is already in sustaining the State's claim today.

The opinion of this Court that comes closer to embodying
the present majority's inherent, natural law theory of sovereign immunity than any other I can find was written by Justice Holmes in Kawananakoa v. Polyblank, 205 U. S. 349
(1907).30 I do not, of course, suggest that Justice Holmes

30 The temptation to look to the natural law conception had shown up
occasionally before Justice Holmes's appointment, and goes back at least
to Beers v. Arkansas, 20 How. 527 (1858), in which Chief Justice Taney
wrote for the Court that "[i]t is an established principle of jurisprudence
in all civilized nations that the sovereign cannot be sued in its own courts,
or in any other, without its consent and permission," id., at 529. But
nothing turned on this pronouncement, because the outcome in the case
would have been the same had sovereign immunity been understood as a
common law property of the States. In Nichols v. United States, 7 Wall.
122 (1869), Justice Davis wrote: "Every government has an inherent
right to protect itself against suits . . . . The principle is fundamental,
[and] applies to every sovereign power . . . ." Id., at 126. This description came in dicta, and the origin of the immunity had no bearing on the
decision. Justice Bradley quoted both Hamilton and Chief Justice Taney
in Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U. S. 1, 13, 17 (1890), but nothing there depended on the natural law approach, and in the main the opinion, whatever
its other demerits, see Seminole Tribe, supra, at 119 (Souter, J., dissenting), understood state sovereign immunity as a common law concept, see
Hans, supra, at 16 ("The suability of a State without its consent was a
thing unknown to the law"). And the Court in Seminole Tribe may possibly have intended to hint at the natural law background of sovereign immunity when it said approvingly that the decision in Hans " `found its

was a natural law jurist, see "Natural Law," in O. Holmes,
Collected Legal Papers 312 (1920, reprinted 1952) ("The jurists who believe in natural law seem to me to be in that
nai"ve state of mind that accepts what has been familiar and
accepted . . . as something that must be accepted"). But in
Kawananakoa he gave not only a cogent restatement of the
natural law view of sovereign immunity, but one that includes a feature (omitted from Hamilton's formulation) explaining why even the most absolutist version of sovereign
immunity doctrine actually refutes the Court's position
today: the Court fails to realize that under the natural law
theory, sovereign immunity may be invoked only by the sovereign that is the source of the right upon which suit is
brought. Justice Holmes said so expressly: "A sovereign is
exempt from suit, not because of any formal conception or
obsolete theory, but on the logical and practical ground that
there can be no legal right as against the authority that
makes the law on which the right depends." Kawananakoa, supra, at 353.

roots not solely in the common law of England, but in the much more
fundamental "jurisprudence in all civilized nations." ' " 517 U. S., at 69
(quoting Hans, supra, at 17, in turn quoting Beers v. Arkansas, supra, at
529). The Court's occasional seduction by the natural law view should
not, however, obscure its basic adherence to the common law approach.
In United States v. Lee, 106 U. S. 196 (1882), the Court explained that "the
doctrine is derived from the laws and practices of our English ancestors,"
id., at 205, and added approvingly that the petition of right "has been as
efficient in securing the rights of suitors against the crown in all cases
appropriate to judicial proceedings, as that which the law affords to the
subjects of the King in legal controversies among themselves," ibid. The
Court went on to notice that at common law one reason given for sovereign immunity was the "absurdity" of the King's writ running against the
King, id., at 206, but, recognizing the distinct situation in the United
States, the Court admitted candidly that "it is difficult to see on what solid
foundation of principle the exemption from liability to suit rests," ibid.
Even the dissent there discussed in great detail the common law heritage
of the doctrine. See id., at 227-234 (opinion of Gray, J.).

His cited authorities stand in the line that today's Courtpurports to follow: Hobbes, Bodin, Sir John Eliot, and Baldus

de Ubaldis. Hobbes, in the cited work, said this:

"The sovereign of a Commonwealth, be it an assembly
or one man, is not subject to the civil laws. For havingpower to make and repeal laws, he may, when he

pleaseth, free himself from that subjection by repealingthose laws that trouble him, and making of new; and
consequently he was free before. For he is free thatcan be free when he will: nor is it possible for any person
to be bound to himself, because he that can bind can
release; and therefore he that is bound to himself onlyis not bound." Leviathan, ch. 26, $ 2, p. 130.

Jean Bodin produced a similar explanation nearly threequarters of a century before Hobbes, see J. Bodin, Les six
livres de la re' publique, Bk. 1, ch. 8 (1577); Six Books ofthe Commonwealth 28 (M. Tooley transl. 1967) ("[T]he

sovereign . . . cannot in any way be subject to the commandsof another, for it is he who makes law"). Eliot cited Baldus
for the crux of the theory: majesty is "a fulness of powersubject to noe necessitie, limitted within no rules of publicke
Law," 1 J. Eliot, De Jure Maiestatis: or Political Treatise ofGovernment 15 (A. Grosart ed. 1882), and Baldus himself
made the point in observing that no one is bound by his own
statute as of necessity, see Commentary of Baldus on thestatute

Digna vox in Justinian's Code 1.14.4, Lectura super
Codice folio 51b (Chapter De Legibus et constitutionibus)(Venice ed. 1496)

("nemo suo statuto ligatur necessitative").
The "jurists who believe in natural law" might have reproved Justice Holmes for his general skepticism about the
intrinsic value of their views, but they would not have
faulted him for seeing the consequence of their position: if
the sovereign is not the source of the law to be applied, sovereign immunity has no applicability. Justice Holmes indeed
explained that in the case of multiple sovereignties, the sub527US2 Unit: $U91 [05-09-01 13:08:16] PAGES PGT: OPIN
798 ALDEN v. MAINE

Souter, J., dissenting
ordinate sovereign will not be immune where the source ofthe right of action is the sovereign that is dominant. See

Kawananakoa, 205 U. S., at 353, 354 (District of Columbianot immune to private suit, because private rights there are
"created and controlled by Congress and not by a legislatureof the District"). Since the law in this case proceeds from
the national source, whose laws authorized by Article I arebinding in state courts, sovereign immunity cannot be a defense. After Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit
Authority, 469 U. S. 528 (1985), Justice Holmes's logically im-peccable theory yields the clear conclusion that even in a

system of "fundamental" state sovereign immunity, a Statewould be subject to suit

eo nomine in its own courts on afederal claim.

There is no escape from the trap of Holmes's logic saverecourse to the argument that the doctrine of sovereign immunity is not the rationally necessary or inherent immunityof the civilians, but the historically contingent, and to a degree illogical, immunity of the common law. But if theCourt admits that the source of sovereign immunity is the
common law, it must also admit that the common law doc-trine could be changed by Congress acting under the Commerce Clause. It is not for me to say which way the Courtshould turn; but in either case it is clear that Alden's suit
should go forward. II

The Court's rationale for today's holding based on a con-ception of sovereign immunity as somehow fundamental to
sovereignty or inherent in statehood fails for the lack of anysubstantial support for such a conception in the thinking of
the founding era. The Court cannot be counted out yet,however, for it has a second line of argument looking not to
a clause-based reception of the natural law conception oreven to its recognition as a "background principle," see Seminole Tribe, 517 U. S., at 72, but to a structural basis in theConstitution's creation of a federal system. Immunity, the

Court says, "inheres in the system of federalism establishedby the Constitution," ante, at 730, its "contours [being] determined by the Founders' understanding, not by the princi-ples or limitations derived from natural law," ante, at 734.
Again, "[w]e look both to the essential principles of federal-ism and to the special role of the state courts in the constitutional design." Ante, at 748. That is, the Court believesthat the federal constitutional structure itself necessitates
recognition of some degree of state autonomy broad enoughto include sovereign immunity from suit in a State's own
courts, regardless of the federal source of the claim assertedagainst the State. If one were to read the Court's federal
structure rationale in isolation from the preceding portionsof the opinion, it would appear that the Court's position on
state sovereign immunity might have been rested entirelyon federalism alone. If it had been, however, I would still
be in dissent, for the Court's argument that state-court sov-ereign immunity on federal questions is inherent in the very
concept of federal structure is demonstrably mistaken.

A
The National Constitution formally and finally repudiatedthe received political wisdom that a system of multiple sovereignties constituted the "great solecism of an imperium inimperio," cf. Bailyn, The Ideological Origins of the American
Revolution, at 223.31 Once "the atom of sovereignty" hadbeen split, U. S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton, 514 U. S. 779,

31 The authority of the view that Parliament's sovereignty must be indivisible had already been eroded in the decade before independence. Iredell himself, as early as 1774, rejected the applicability of the theory "to
the case of several distinct and independent legislatures each engaged
within a separate scale and employed about different objects," in the
course of arguing for the possibility of a kind of proto-federalist relationship between the Colonies and the King. Iredell, Address to the Inhabitants of Great Britain, in 1 G. McRee, Life and Correspondence of James

838 (1995) (Kennedy, J., concurring), the general scheme ofdelegated sovereignty as between the two component governments of the federal system was clear, and was succinctlystated by Chief Justice Marshall: "In America, the powers of
sovereignty are divided between the government of theUnion, and those of the States. They are each sovereign,
with respect to the objects committed to it, and neither sov-ereign with respect to the objects committed to the other."
McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 410 (1819).32

Hence the flaw in the Court's appeal to federalism. TheState of Maine is not sovereign with respect to the national

objectives of the FLSA.33 It is not the authority thatpromulgated the FLSA, on which the right of action in this
case depends. That authority is the United States actingthrough the Congress, whose legislative power under Article
I of the Constitution to extend FLSA coverage to state employees has already been decided, see Garcia v. San Antonio
Metropolitan Transit Authority, supra, and is not contested here.

32 This is entirely consistent with, and indeed is a corollary of, the statement quoted by the Court that the States are " `no more subject, within
their respective spheres, to the general authority than the general authority is subject to them, within its own sphere.' " Ante, at 714 (quoting The
Federalist No. 39, p. 245 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (J. Madison)). The point is
that matters subject to federal law are within the federal sphere, and
so the States are subject to the general authority where such matters
are concerned.

33 It is therefore sheer circularity for the Court to talk of the "anomaly,"

ante, at 752, that would arise if a State could be sued on federal law in its
own courts, when it may not be sued under federal law in federal court,
Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44 (1996). The short and
sufficient answer is that the anomaly is the Court's own creation: the Eleventh Amendment was never intended to bar federal-question suits against
the States in federal court. The anomaly is that Seminole Tribe, an opinion purportedly grounded in the Eleventh Amendment, should now be
used as a lever to argue for state sovereign immunity in state courts, to
which the Eleventh Amendment by its terms does not apply.

Nor can it be argued that because the State of Maine cre-ates its own court system, it has authority to decide what

sorts of claims may be entertained there, and thus in effectto control the right of action in this case. Maine has created

requires state courts to enforce federal law and state-courtjudges to be bound by it, requires the Maine courts to entertain this federal cause of action. Maine has advanced no" `valid excuse,' "

Howlett v. Rose, 496 U. S. 356, 369 (1990)(quoting Douglas v. New York, N. H. & H. R. Co., 279 U. S.

377, 387-388 (1929)), for its courts' refusal to hear federal-lawclaims in which Maine is a defendant, and sovereign immunity cannot be that excuse, simply because the State is notsovereign with respect to the subject of the claim against
it. The Court's insistence that the federal structure barsCongress from making States susceptible to suit in their own
courts is, then, plain mistake.34

B
It is symptomatic of the weakness of the structural notionproffered by the Court that it seeks to buttress the argument

by relying on " `the dignity and respect afforded a State,

34 Perhaps as a corollary to its view of sovereign immunity as to some
degree indefeasible because "fundamental," the Court frets that the
"power to press a State's own courts into federal service to coerce the
other branches of the State . . . is the power first to turn the State against
itself and ultimately to commandeer the entire political machinery of the
State against its will and at the behest of individuals." Ante, at 749.
But this is to forget that the doctrine of separation of powers prevails in
our Republic. When the state judiciary enforces federal law against state
officials, as the Supremacy Clause requires it to do, it is not turning against
the State's executive any more than we turn against the Federal Executive when we apply federal law to the United States: it is simply upholding
the rule of law. There is no "commandeering" of the State's resources
where the State is asked to do no more than enforce federal law.

which the immunity is designed to protect,' " ante, at 749

268 (1997)), and by invoking the many demands on a State's
fisc, ante, at 750-751. Apparently beguiled by Gilded Era
language describing private suits against States as " `neither
becoming nor convenient,' " ante, at 748 (quoting In re Ayers,
123 U. S. 443, 505 (1887)), the Court calls "immunity from
private suits central to sovereign dignity," ante, at 715, and
assumes that this "dignity" is a quality easily translated from
the person of the King to the participatory abstraction of a
republican State, see, e. g., ante, at 749 ("[C]ongressional
power to authorize private suits against nonconsenting
States in their own courts would be . . . offensive to state
sovereignty"). The thoroughly anomalous character of this
appeal to dignity is obvious from a reading of Blackstone's
description of royal dignity, which he sets out as a premise
of his discussion of sovereignty:

"First, then, of the royal dignity. Under every monarchical establishment, it is necessary to distinguish the
prince from his subjects. . . . The law therefore ascribes
to the king . . . certain attributes of a great and transcendent nature; by which the people are led to consider
him in the light of a superior being, and to pay him that
awful respect, which may enable him with greater ease
to carry on the business of government. This is what I
understand by the royal dignity, the several branches of
which we will now proceed to examine." 1 Blackstone
*241.

It would be hard to imagine anything more inimical to the
republican conception, which rests on the understanding of
its citizens precisely that the government is not above them,
but of them, its actions being governed by law just like their
own. Whatever justification there may be for an American

government's immunity from private suit, it is not dignity.35
See United States v. Lee, 106 U. S. 196, 208 (1882).

It is equally puzzling to hear the Court say that "federal
power to authorize private suits for money damages would
place unwarranted strain on the States' ability to govern in
accordance with the will of their citizens." Ante, at 750-
751. So long as the citizens' will, expressed through state
legislation, does not violate valid federal law, the strain will
not be felt; and to the extent that state action does violate
federal law, the will of the citizens of the United States already trumps that of the citizens of the State: the strain then
is not only expected, but necessarily intended.

Least of all does the Court persuade by observing that
"other important needs" than that of the "judgment creditor" compete for public money, ante, at 751. The "judgment
creditor" in question is not a dunning bill collector, but a
citizen whose federal rights have been violated, and a constitutional structure that stints on enforcing federal rights out
of an abundance of delicacy toward the States has substituted politesse in place of respect for the rule of law.36

35 Furthermore, the very idea of dignity ought also to imply that the
State should be subject to, and not outside of, the law. It is surely ironic
that one of the loci classici of Roman law regarding the imperial prerogative begins with (and is known by) the assertion that it is appropriate to
the Emperor's dignity that he acknowledge (or, on some readings, at least
claim) that he is bound by the laws. See Digna Vox, Justinian's Code
1.4.14 ("Digna vox maiestate regnantis legis alligatum se principem profiteri") ("It is a statement worthy of the majesty of the ruler for the Prince
to profess himself bound by the laws"); see Pennington, The Prince and
the Law, 1200-1600, at 78, and n. 6.

36 The Court also claims that subjecting States to suit puts power in the

hands of state courts that the State may wish to assign to its legislature,
thus assigning the state judiciary a role "foreign to its experience but
beyond its competence . . . ." Ante, at 752. This comes perilously close
to legitimizing political defiance of valid federal law.

If neither theory nor structure can supply the basis for theCourt's conceptions of sovereign immunity and federalism,

then perhaps history might. The Court apparently believesthat because state courts have not historically entertained
Commerce Clause based federal-law claims against theStates, such an innovation carries a presumption of unconstitutionality. See ante, at 744 (arguing that absence of stat-utes authorizing suits against States in state court suggests
an assumed absence of such power). At the outset, it has tobe noted that this approach assumes a more cohesive record
than history affords. In Hilton v. South Carolina PublicRailways Comm'n, 502 U. S. 197 (1991) (

Kennedy, J.), a casethe Court labors mightily to distinguish, see

ante, at 737,37we held that a state-owned railroad could be sued in state

court under the Federal Employers' Liability Act, 45 U. S. C.$$ 51-60, notwithstanding the lack of an express congressional statement, because " `the Eleventh Amendment doesnot apply in state courts.' "

Hilton, supra, at 205 (quotingWill v. Michigan Dept. of State Police, 491 U. S. 58, 63-64

(1989)).38 But even if the record were less unkempt, the

37 In its discussion of Hilton, the Court attempts to explain away the
State's failure to raise a sovereign immunity defense by acknowledging
candidly that when that case was decided, "it may have appeared to the
State that Congress' power to abrogate its immunity from suit in any
court was not limited by the Constitution at all." Ante, at 737. The
reasoning of Hilton suggests that it appeared not only to the State, but
also to the Court, that Congress could abrogate state sovereign immunity
in state court. If Congress could not, then there would have been no
jurisdiction in the case. The Court never even hinted that constitutional
structure, much less the Tenth Amendment, might bar the suit, even
though the dissent stressed that "the principle of federalism underlying
the [Eleventh] Amendment pervades the constitutional structure," 502
U. S., at 209 (opinion of O'Connor, J.).

38 Nor does Poindexter v. Greenhow, 114 U. S. 270 (1885), one of the

Virginia Coupon Cases, fit comfortably with the assumption that state
courts have exercised no disputed jurisdiction over their own governments
on federal questions. Under its Funding Act of 1871, Virginia had issued

Souter, J., dissenting
problem with arguing from historical practice in this case is
that past practice, even if unbroken, provides no basis for
demanding preservation when the conditions on which the
practice depended have changed in a constitutionally relevant way.

It was at one time, though perhaps not from the framing,
believed that "Congress' authority to regulate the States
under the Commerce Clause" was limited by "certain underbonds that specified on their face that the attached coupons should be
receivable at and after maturity for all taxes, debts, dues, and demands
due the State. Id., at 278. In 1882, however, Virginia passed a law requiring its tax collectors to accept nothing but gold, silver, or currency in
payment of taxes. Id., at 275. After the bonds reached maturity, Poindexter used them to pay state property taxes; Greenhow, the local tax
collector, ignored the payment and took possession of an office desk in
Poindexter's possession to sell it for unpaid taxes. Poindexter brought a
common law action in detinue against the tax collector in state court for
recovery of the desk, arguing that the later Virginia statute barring use
of the coupons violated the Contracts Clause. Greenhow defended, inter
alia, on the theory that the suit was "substantially an action against the
State of Virginia, to which it has not assented." Id., at 285. The Court
rejected this claim by applying to the State of Virginia reasoning akin to,
though broader than, that later adopted in Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123
(1908). We held that, where state legislative action is unconstitutional, it
"is not the word or deed of the State, but is the mere wrong and trespass
of those individual persons who falsely speak and act in its name," 114
U. S., at 290. Because the original bonds were binding contracts, the obligation of which Virginia could not constitutionally impair, "[t]he true and
real Commonwealth which contracted the obligation is incapable in law of
doing anything in derogation of it." Id., at 293. It therefore could not
be argued that the tax collector was acting on behalf of the State, because
"[t]he State of Virginia has done none of these things with which this
defence charges her. The defendant in error is not her officer, her agent,
or her representative, in the matter complained of, for he has acted not
only without her authority, but contrary to her express commands." Ibid.
Although the tax collector had done nothing more than collect taxes under
duly enacted state law, he was held to be liable to suit. Thus in the only
case to have come before this Court specifically involving a claim of state
sovereign immunity of constitutional magnitude in a State's own court,
jurisdiction was upheld.

lying elements of political sovereignty . . . deemed essentialto the States' `separate and independent existence.' "

Garcia, 469 U. S., at 547-548 (quoting Lane County v. Oregon, 7Wall. 71, 76 (1869)). On this belief, the preordained balance

between state and federal sovereignty was understood to
trump the terms of Article I and preclude Congress fromsubjecting States to federal law on certain subjects. (From

time to time, wage and hour regulation has been countedamong those subjects, see

infra, at 808.) As a consequence
it was rare, if not unknown, for state courts to confront thesituation in which federal law enacted under the Commerce

Clause provided the authority for a private right of action
against a State in state court. The question of state immunity from a Commerce Clause based federal-law suit in state
court thus tended not to arise for the simple reason that Acts
of Congress authorizing such suits did not exist.

Today, however, in light of Garcia, supra (overruling National League of Cities v. Usery, 426 U. S. 833 (1976)), the
law is settled that federal legislation enacted under the Commerce Clause may bind the States without having to satisfy
a test of undue incursion into state sovereignty. "[T]he fundamental limitation that the constitutional scheme imposes
on the Commerce Clause to protect the `States as States' is
one of process rather than one of result." Garcia, supra, at
554. Because the commerce power is no longer thought to
be circumscribed, the dearth of prior private federal claims
entertained against the States in state courts does not tell
us anything, and reflects nothing but an earlier and less expansive application of the commerce power.

Least of all is it to the point for the Court to suggest that
because the Framers would be surprised to find States subjected to a federal-law suit in their own courts under the
commerce power, the suit must be prohibited by the Constitution. See ante, at 741-743 (arguing on the basis of the
"historical record" that the Constitution would not have been
adopted if it had been understood to allow suit against States

in state court under federal law). The Framers' intentionsand expectations count so far as they point to the meaning

of the Constitution's text or the fair implications of its struc-ture, but they do not hover over the instrument to veto any
application of its principles to a world that the Framers couldnot have anticipated.

If the Framers would be surprised to see States subjectedto suit in their own courts under the commerce power, they
would be astonished by the reach of Congress under theCommerce Clause generally. The proliferation of Government, State and Federal, would amaze the Framers, and theadministrative state with its reams of regulations would
leave them rubbing their eyes. But the Framers' surpriseat, say, the FLSA, or the Federal Communications Commission, or the Federal Reserve Board is no threat to the con-stitutionality of any one of them, for a very fundamental
reason:

"[W]hen we are dealing with words that also are a con-stituent act, like the Constitution of the United States,

we must realize that they have called into life a beingthe development of which could not have been foreseen
completely by the most gifted of its begetters. It wasenough for them to realize or to hope that they had created an organism; it has taken a century and has costtheir successors much sweat and blood to prove that
they created a nation. The case before us must be con-sidered in the light of our whole experience and not
merely in that of what was said a hundred years ago."Missouri v. Holland, 252 U. S. 416, 433 (1920) (Holmes,

has repeatedly sustained the exercise of power by Con-gress, under various clauses of that instrument, over
objects of which the Fathers could not have dreamed."

A

If today's decision occasions regret at its anomalous ver-sions of history and federal theory, it is the more regrettable

in being the second time the Court has suddenly changedthe course of prior decision in order to limit the exercise of
authority over a subject now concededly within the ArticleI jurisdiction of the Congress. The FLSA, which requires
employers to pay a minimum wage, was first enacted in 1938,with an exemption for States acting as employers. See
Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U. S. 183, 185-186 (1968). In 1966,it was amended to remove the state employer exemption so
far as it concerned workers in hospitals, institutions, andschools. See

id., at 186-187, and n. 6. In Wirtz, the Courtupheld the amendment over the dissent's argument that extending the FLSA to these state employees was "such a seri-ous invasion of state sovereignty protected by the Tenth
Amendment that it is . . . not consistent with our constitu-tional federalism." Id., at 201 (opinion of Douglas, J.).

In 1974, Congress again amended the FLSA, this time "ex-tend[ing] the minimum wage and maximum hour provisions
to almost all public employees employed by the States andby their various political subdivisions."

National League ofCities, 426 U. S., at 836. This time the Court went the other

way: in National League of Cities, the Court held the exten-sion of the Act to these employees an unconstitutional infringement of state sovereignty, id., at 852; for good meas-ure, the Court overturned

Wirtz, dismissing its reasoning asno longer authoritative, see 426 U. S., at 854-855.

But National League of Cities was not the last word. InGarcia, decided some nine years later, the Court addressed
the question whether a municipally owned mass-transit

system was exempt from the FLSA. 469 U. S., at 534, 536.In holding that it was not, the Court overruled

National
League of Cities, see 469 U. S., at 557, this time taking theposition that Congress was not barred by the Constitution

from binding the States as employers under the Commerce
Clause, id., at 554. As already mentioned, the Court held
that whatever protection the Constitution afforded to the
States' sovereignty lay in the constitutional structure, not in
some substantive guarantee. Ibid.39 Garcia remains good
law, its reasoning has not been repudiated, and it has not
been challenged here.

The FLSA has not, however, fared as well in practice as
it has in theory. The Court in Seminole Tribe created a
significant impediment to the statute's practical application
by rendering its damages provisions unenforceable against
the States by private suit in federal court. Today's decision
blocking private actions in state courts makes the barrier to
individual enforcement a total one.

39 Garcia demonstrates that, contra the Court's suggestion, the FLSA
does not impermissibly act upon the States, see ante, at 714. Rather, the
FLSA, enacted lawfully pursuant to the commerce power, treats the
States like other employers. The Court seems to have misunderstood
Hamilton's statement in The Federalist No. 15 that the citizens are " ` "the
only proper objects of government," ' " ante, at 714 (quoting Printz v.
United States, 521 U. S. 898, 919-920 (1997)). Hamilton's point is not, as
the Court seems to think, that the National Government should dictate
nothing to the States in order to protect their residual sovereignty. To
the contrary, Hamilton, who was arguing against the extreme respect for
state sovereignty in the Articles of Confederation, meant precisely that
the National Government should not act as the leader of a "league," The
Federalist No. 15, p. 95 (J. Cooke ed. 1961), mediating among several sovereignties, but as a "national government," ibid., with power to produce
obedience through the "COER[C]ION of the magistracy," ibid. Hamilton
is therefore the wrong person to quote for the proposition that the National Government may not act upon the States, since his point was that
the National Government should not be limited to acting through the
medium of the States.

The Court might respond to the charge that in practice it
has vitiated Garcia by insisting, as counsel for Maine argued,Brief for Respondent 11-12, that the United States may

bring suit in federal court against a State for damages underthe FLSA, on the authority of

United States v. Texas, 143
U. S. 621, 644-645 (1892). See also Seminole Tribe, 517U. S., at 71, n. 14. It is true, of course, that the FLSA does

authorize the Secretary of Labor to file suit seeking damages, see 29 U. S. C. $ 216(c), but unless Congress plans a sig-nificant expansion of the National Government's litigating

forces to provide a lawyer whenever private litigation isbarred by today's decision and

Seminole Tribe, the allusion
to enforcement of private rights by the National Govern-ment is probably not much more than whimsy. Facing reality, Congress specifically found, as long ago as 1974, "thatthe enforcement capability of the Secretary of Labor is not
alone sufficient to provide redress in all or even a substantial
portion of the situations where compliance is not forthcomingvoluntarily." S. Rep. No. 93-690, p. 27 (1974). One hopes

that such voluntary compliance will prove more popular thanit has in Maine, for there is no reason today to suspect that
enforcement by the Secretary of Labor alone would likelyprove adequate to assure compliance with this federal law in
the multifarious circumstances of some 4.7 million employeesof the 50 States of the Union.

40

The point is not that the difficulties of enforcement shoulddrive the Court's decision, but simply that where Congress

has created a private right to damages, it is implausible toclaim that enforcement by a public authority without any
incentive beyond its general enforcement power will ever af-ford the private right a traditionally adequate remedy. No

one would think the remedy adequate if private tort claimsagainst a State could only be brought by the National Government: the tradition of private enforcement, as old as thecommon law itself, is the benchmark. But wage claims have
a lineage of private enforcement just as ancient, and a claimunder the FLSA is a claim for wages due on work performed.
Denying private enforcement of an FLSA claim is thus onpar with closing the courthouse door to state tort victims
unaccompanied by a lawyer from Washington.So there is much irony in the Court's profession that it
grounds its opinion on a deeply rooted historical tradition ofsovereign immunity, when the Court abandons a principle
nearly as inveterate, and much closer to the hearts of theFramers: that where there is a right, there must be a remedy. Lord Chief Justice Holt could state this as an unques-tioned proposition already in 1702, as he did in Ashby v.
White, 6 Mod. 45, 53-54, 87 Eng. Rep. 808, 815 (Q. B.):

"If an act of parliament be made for the benefit ofany person, and he is hindered by another of that benefit, by necessary consequence of law he shall have an ac-tion; and the current of all the books is so" (citation
omitted).41
41 The principle is even older with respect to rights created by statute,
like the FLSA rights here, than it is for common law damages. Lord Holt
in fact argued that the well-established principle in the context of statutory rights applied to common law rights as well. See Ashby v. White, 6
Mod., at 54, 87 Eng. Rep., at 816 ("Now if this be so in case of an Act of
Parliament, why shall not common law be so too? For sure the common
law is as forcible as any Act of Parliament"). A still older formulation of
the statutory right appears in a note in Coke's Reports: "[W]hen any thing
is prohibited by an act, although that the act doth not give an action, yet
action lieth upon it." 6 Co. Rep., pt. 12, p. *100. Coke's Institutes yield
a similar statement: "When any act doth prohibit any wrong or vexation,
though no action be particularly named in the act, yet the party grieved
shall have an action grounded upon this statute." 1 E. Coke, The Second
Part of the Institutes of the Laws of England 117 (1797) (reprinted in 5B
2d Historical Writings in Law and Jurisprudence (1986)). In our case, of
course, the statute expressly gives an action.

Blackstone considered it "a general and indisputable rule,that where there is a legal right, there is also a legal remedy,

by suit or action at law, whenever that right is invaded." 3Blackstone *23. The generation of the Framers thought the
principle so crucial that several States put it into their con-stitutions.

42 And when Chief Justice Marshall asked about

Marbury: "If he has a right, and that right has been violated,do the laws of his country afford him a remedy?,"

Marburyv. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 162 (1803), the question was rhetorical, and the answer clear:

"The very essence of civil liberty certainly consists inthe right of every individual to claim the protection of

the laws, whenever he receives an injury. One of thefirst duties of government is to afford that protection.
In Great Britain the king himself is sued in the respect-ful form of a petition, and he never fails to comply with
the judgment of his court." Id., at 163.
Yet today the Court has no qualms about saying franklythat the federal right to damages afforded by Congress

under the FLSA cannot create a concomitant private rem-edy. The right was "made for the benefit of " petitioners;
they have been "hindered by another of that benefit"; butdespite what has long been understood as the "necessary
consequence of law," they have no action, cf. Ashby, supra,at 53, 87 Eng. Rep., at 815. It will not do for the Court to
respond that a remedy was never available where the rightin question was against the sovereign. A State is not the
sovereign when a federal claim is pressed against it, andeven the English sovereign opened itself to recovery and,

unlike Maine, provided the remedy to complement the right.To the Americans of the founding generation it would have

been clear (as it was to Chief Justice Marshall) that if theKing would do right, the democratically chosen Government
of the United States could do no less.43 The Chief Justice's

43 Unfortunately, and despite the Court's professed "unwilling[ness] to
assume the States will refuse to honor the Constitution and obey the binding laws of the United States," ante, at 755, that presumption of the sovereign's good-faith intention to follow the laws has managed somehow to
disappear in the intervening two centuries, despite the general trend toward greater, not lesser, government accountability. Anyone inclined toward economic theories of history may look at the development of sovereign immunity doctrine in this country and see that it has been driven by
the great and recurrent question of state debt, both in the aftermath of
Chisholm and in the last quarter of the 19th century, see Seminole Tribe,
517 U. S., at 120-122 (Souter, J., dissenting). And no matter what one
may think of the quality of the legal doctrine that the problem of state
debt has helped to produce, one can at least argue that States' periodic
attempts to repudiate their debts were not purely or egregiously lawless,
because those who held state-issued bonds may well have valued and purchased them with the knowledge that default was a real possibility.

Maine's refusal to follow federal law in the case before us, however, is
of a different order. Far from defaulting on debt to eyes-open creditors,
Maine is simply withholding damages from private citizens to whom they
appear to be due. Before Seminole Tribe was decided, petitioners here
were the beneficiaries of a District Court ruling to the effect that they
were entitled to some coverage, and hence to some amount of damages,
under the FLSA. Mills v. Maine, 839 F. Supp. 3 (Me. 1993). Before us,
Maine has not claimed that petitioners are not covered by the FLSA, but
only that it is protected from suit. Indeed, Maine acknowledges that it
may be sued by the United States in federal court for damages on the
very same claim, Brief for Respondent 12-13, and we are told that Maine
now pays employees like petitioners overtime as covered by the FLSA,
id., at 3. Why the State of Maine has not rendered this case unnecessary
by paying damages to petitioners under the FLSA of its own free will
remains unclear to me. The Court says that "it is conceded by all that
the State has altered its conduct so that its compliance with federal law
cannot now be questioned." Ante, at 759. But the ambiguous qualifier
"now" allows the Court to avoid the fact that whatever its forward-looking

responding to the objection to jurisdiction in Chisholm:"[The Framers] must have viewed human rights in their

V
The Court has swung back and forth with regrettable dis-ruption on the enforceability of the FLSA against the States,

but if the present majority had a defensible position onecould at least accept its decision with an expectation of stability ahead. As it is, any such expectation would be nai"ve.The resemblance of today's state sovereign immunity to the
Lochner era's industrial due process is striking. The Courtbegan this century by imputing immutable constitutional
status to a conception of economic self-reliance that wasnever true to industrial life and grew insistently fictional
with the years, and the Court has chosen to close the centuryby conferring like status on a conception of state sovereign
immunity that is true neither to history nor to the structureof the Constitution. I expect the Court's late essay into immunity doctrine will prove the equal of its earlier experi-ment in laissez-faire, the one being as unrealistic as the
other, as indefensible, and probably as fleeting.

ORTIZ et al. v. FIBREBOARD CORP. et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fifth circuit

No. 97-1704. Argued December 8, 1998--Decided June 23, 1999
Respondent Fibreboard Corporation, an asbestos manufacturer, was

locked in litigation for decades. Plaintiffs filed a stream of personal
injury claims against it, swelling throughout the 1980's and 1990's to
thousands of claims for compensatory damages each year. Fibreboard
engaged in litigation with its insurers, respondent Continental Casualty
Company and respondent Pacific Indemnity Company, over insurance
coverage for the personal injury claims. In 1990, a California trial
court ruled against Continental and Pacific, and the insurers appealed.
At around the same time, Fibreboard approached a group of asbestos
plaintiffs' lawyers, offering to discuss a "global settlement" of Fibreboard's asbestos liability. Negotiations at one point led to the settlement of some 45,000 pending claims, and the parties eventually agreed
upon $1.535 billion as the key term of a "Global Settlement Agreement."
Of this sum, $1.525 billion would come from Continental and Pacific,
which had joined the negotiations, while Fibreboard would contribute
$10 million, all but $500,000 of it from other insurance proceeds. At
plaintiffs' counsels' insistence, Fibreboard and its insurers then reached
a backup settlement of the coverage dispute in the "Trilateral Settlement Agreement," under which the insurers agreed to provide Fibreboard with $2 billion to defend against asbestos claimants and pay the
winners, should the Global Settlement Agreement fail to win court approval. Subsequently, a group of named plaintiffs filed the present action in Federal District Court, seeking certification for settlement purposes of a mandatory class comprising three groups--claimants who
had not yet sued Fibreboard, those who had dismissed such claims and
retained the right to sue in the future, and relatives of class members--
but excluded claimants who had actions pending against Fibreboard or
who had filed and, for negotiated value, dismissed such claims, and
whose only retained right is to sue Fibreboard upon development of
an asbestos-related malignancy. The District Court allowed petitioners
and other objectors to intervene, held a fairness hearing under Federal
Rule of Civil Procedure 23(e), ruled that the threshold Rule 23(a) numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation requirements were met, and certified the class under Rule 23(b)(1)(B). In response to intervenors' objections that the absence of a "limited fund"

527US2 Unit: $U92 [05-04-01 14:06:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN
816 ORTIZ v. FIBREBOARD CORP.

Syllabus
precluded Rule 23(b)(1)(B) certification, the District Court ruled that
both the disputed insurance asset liquidated by the $1.535 billion global
settlement, and, alternatively, the sum of the value of Fibreboard plus
the value of its insurance coverage, as measured by the insurance funds'
settlement value, were relevant "limited funds." The Fifth Circuit affirmed both as to class certification and adequacy of settlement. Agreeing with the District Court's application of Rule 23(a), the Court of
Appeals found, inter alia, that there were no conflicts of interest sufficiently serious to undermine the adequacy of class counsel's representation. As to Rule 23(b)(1)(B), the court approved the class certification
on a "limited fund" rationale based on the threat to other class members'
ability to receive full payment from Fibreboard's limited assets. This
Court then decided Amchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U. S. 591,
vacated the Fifth Circuit's judgment, and remanded for further consideration in light of that decision. The Fifth Circuit again affirmed the
District Court's judgment on remand.

Held:

1. This Court need not resolve two threshold matters before proceeding to the nub of the case. First, petitioners call the class claims nonjusticiable under Article III, saying that this is a feigned action initiated
by Fibreboard to control its future asbestos tort liability, with the vast
majority of the exposure-only class members being without injury in
fact and hence without standing to sue. While an Article III court
ordinarily must be sure of its own jurisdiction before getting to the
merits, Steel Co. v. Citizens For Better Environment, 523 U. S. 83, 88-
89, a Rule 23 question should be treated first because class certification
issues are "logically antecedent" to Article III concerns, Amchem,
supra, at 612, and pertain to statutory standing, which may properly be
treated before Article III standing, see Steel Co., supra, at 92. Second,
although petitioners are correct that the Fifth Circuit on remand fell
short in its attention to Amchem in passing on the Rule 23(a) issues,
these points are dealt with in the Court's review of the certification
on the Fifth Circuit's "limited fund" theory under Rule 23(b)(1)(B).
Pp. 830-832.

2. Applicants for contested certification of a mandatory settlement
class on a limited fund theory under Rule 23(b)(1)(B) must show that
the fund is limited by more than the agreement of the parties, and has
been allocated to claimants belonging within the class by a process addressing the conflicting interests of class members. Pp. 832-848.

(a) In drafting Rule 23(b), the Civil Rules Advisory Committee
sought to catalogue in functional terms those recurrent life patterns
which call for mass litigation through representative parties. Rule

Syllabus
23(b)(1)(B) (read with subdivision (c)(2)) provides for certification of a
class whose members have no right to withdraw, when "the prosecution
of separate actions . . . would create a risk" of "adjudications with respect to individual [class] members . . . which would as a practical matter
be dispositive of the interests of the other members not parties to the
adjudications or substantially impair or impede their ability to protect
their interests." Among the traditional varieties of representative
suits encompassed by Rule 23(b)(1)(B) is the limited fund class action.
In such a case, equity required absent parties to be represented, joinder
being impractical, where individual claims to be satisfied from the one
asset would, as a practical matter, prejudice the rights of absent claimants against a fund inadequate to pay them all. Pp. 832-837.

(b) The cases forming the limited fund class action's pedigree as
understood by Rule 23's drafters have a number of common characteristics, despite the variety of circumstances from which they arose. These
characteristics show what the Advisory Committee must have assumed
would be at least a sufficient set of conditions to justify binding absent
members of a Rule 23(b)(1)(B) class, from which no one has the right
to secede. In sum, mandatory class treatment through representative
actions on a limited fund theory was justified with reference to a "fund"
with a definitely ascertained limit that was inadequate to pay all claims
against it, all of which was distributed to satisfy all those with claims
based on a common theory of liability, by an equitable, pro rata distribution. Pp. 838-841.

(c) There are good reasons to treat the foregoing characteristics as
presumptively necessary, and not merely sufficient, to satisfy the limited
fund rationale for a mandatory class action. At the least, the burden of
justification rests on the proponent of any departure from the traditional
norm. Although Rule 23(b)(1)(B)'s text is open to a more lenient limited
fund concept, the greater the leniency in departing from the historical
model, the greater the likelihood of abuse in ways that are apparent
when the limited fund criteria are applied to this case. The prudent
course, therefore, is to presume that when subdivision (b)(1)(B) was devised to cover limited fund actions, the object was to stay close to the
historical model. This limiting construction finds support in the Advisory Committee's expressions of understanding, which clearly did not
contemplate that the mandatory class action codified in subdivision
(b)(1)(B) would be used to aggregate unliquidated tort claims on a limited fund rationale. The construction also minimizes potential conflict
with the Rules Enabling Act, which requires that rules of procedure
"not abridge, enlarge or modify any substantive right," 28 U. S. C.

$ 2072(b). See, e. g., Amchem, supra, at 613. Finally, the Court's construction avoids serious constitutional concerns, including the Seventh

Amendment jury trial rights of absent class members, and the due process principle that, with limited exceptions, one is not bound by a judgment in personam in litigation in which he is not a party, Hansberry v.
Lee, 311 U. S. 32, 40. Pp. 841-848.

3. The record on which the District Court rested its class certification
did not support the essential premises of a mandatory limited fund class
action. It did not demonstrate that the fund was limited except by the
agreement of the parties, and it affirmatively allowed exclusions from
the class and allocations of assets at odds with the concept of limited
fund treatment and the Rule 23(a) structural protections explained in
Amchem. Pp. 848-861.

(a) The certification defect going to the most characteristic feature
of a limited fund action was the uncritical adoption by both courts below
of figures agreed upon by the parties in defining the fund's limits. In a
settlement-only class action such as this, the settling parties must present not only their agreement, but evidence on which the district court
may ascertain the fund's limits, with support in findings of fact following
a proceeding in which the evidence is subject to challenge. Here, there
was no adequate demonstration of the fund's upper limit. The "fund"
comprised both Fibreboard's general assets and the insurance provided
by the two policies. As to the general assets, the lower courts concluded that Fibreboard had a then-current sale value of $235 million
that could be devoted to the limited fund. While that estimate may
have been conservative, at least the District Court heard evidence and
made an independent finding at some point in the proceedings. The
same, however, cannot be said for the value of the disputed insurance.
Instead of independently evaluating potential insurance funds, the
courts below simply accepted the $2 billion Trilateral Settlement Agreement figure, concluding that where insurance coverage is disputed, it is
appropriate to value the insurance asset at a settlement value. Such
value may be good evidence of the maximum available if one can assume
that parties of equal knowledge and negotiating skill agreed upon the
figure through arms-length bargaining, unhindered by any considerations tugging against the interests of the parties ostensibly represented
in the negotiation. No such assumption may be indulged in here, since
at least some of the same lawyers representing the class also negotiated
the separate settlement of 45,000 pending claims, the full payment of
which was contingent on a successful global settlement agreement or
the successful resolution of the insurance coverage dispute. Class counsel thus had great incentive to reach any global settlement that they
thought might survive a Rule 23(e) fairness hearing, rather than the
best possible arrangement for the substantially unidentified global settlement class. See Amchem, supra, at 626-627. Pp. 848-853.

Syllabus
(b) The settlement certification also fell short with respect to the
inclusiveness of the class and the fairness of distributions to those
within it. The class excludes myriad claimants with causes of action,
or foreseeable causes of action, arising from exposure to Fibreboard
asbestos. The number of those outside the class who settled with a
reservation of rights may be uncertain, but there is no such uncertainty
about the significance of the settlement's exclusion of the 45,000 inventory plaintiffs and the plaintiffs in the unsettled present cases, estimated
at more than 53,000. A mandatory limited fund settlement class cannot
qualify for certification when, in the very negotiations aimed at a class
settlement, class counsel agree to exclude what may turn out to be as
much as a third of the claimants that negotiators thought might eventually be involved, a substantial number of whom class counsel represent.
The settlement certification is likewise deficient as to the fairness of the
fund's distribution among class members. First, a class including holders of present and future claims (some of the latter involving no physical
injury and claimants not yet born) requires division into homogeneous
subclasses under Rule 23(c)(4)(B), with separate representation to eliminate conflicting interests of counsel. See Amchem, 521 U. S., at 627.
No such procedure was employed here. Second, the class included
those exposed to Fibreboard's asbestos products both before and after
1959, the year that saw the expiration of Fibreboard's Continental policy, which provided the bulk of the insurance funds for the settlement.
Pre-1959 claimants accordingly had more valuable claims than post-1959
claimants, the consequence being a second instance of disparate interests within the certified class. While at some point there must be
an end to reclassification with separate counsel, these two instances of
conflict are well within Amchem's structural protection requirement.
Pp. 854-859.

(c) A third contested feature that departs markedly from the limited fund antecedents is the ultimate provision for a fund smaller than
the assets understood by the Fifth Circuit to be available for payment
of the mandatory class members' claims. Most notably, Fibreboard was
allowed to retain virtually its entire net worth. Given this Court's
treatment of the two preceding certification deficiencies, there is no need
to decide whether this feature would alone be fatal to the global settlement. To ignore it entirely, however, would be so misleading that the
Court simply identifies the issue it raises, without purporting to resolve
it at this time. Fibreboard listed its supposed entire net worth as a
component of the total (and allegedly inadequate) assets available for
claimants, but subsequently retained all but $500,000 of that equity
for itself. It hardly appears that such a regime is the best that can
be provided for class members. Whether in a case where a settle527US2 Unit: $U92 [05-04-01 14:06:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN

member's pocket in the absence of settlement, a credit for some of
the savings may be recognized as an incentive to settlement is at
least a legitimate question, which the Court leaves for another day.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case turns on the conditions for certifying a manda-tory settlement class on a limited fund theory under Federal

Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(1)(B). We hold that applicantsfor contested certification on this rationale must show that
the fund is limited by more than the agreement of the par-ties, and has been allocated to claimants belonging within
the class by a process addressing any conflicting interests ofclass members.

I
Like Amchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U. S. 591(1997), this case is a class action prompted by the elephantine

mass of asbestos cases, and our discussion in Amchem willsuffice to show how this litigation defies customary judicial
administration and calls for national legislation.1 In 1967,one of the first actions for personal asbestos injury was filed
in the United States District Court for the Eastern District

1 " `[This] is a tale of danger known in the 1930s, exposure inflicted upon
millions of Americans in the 1940s and 1950s, injuries that began to take
their toll in the 1960s, and a flood of lawsuits beginning in the 1970s. On
the basis of past and current filing data, and because of a latency period
that may last as long as 40 years for some asbestos related diseases, a
continuing stream of claims can be expected. The final toll of asbestos
related injuries is unknown. Predictions have been made of 200,000 asbestos disease deaths before the year 2000 and as many as 265,000 by the
year 2015.

" `The most objectionable aspects of asbestos litigation can be briefly
summarized: dockets in both federal and state courts continue to grow;
long delays are routine; trials are too long; the same issues are litigated
over and over; transaction costs exceed the victims' recovery by nearly
two to one; exhaustion of assets threatens and distorts the process; and
future claimants may lose altogether.' " Amchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U. S., at 598 (quoting Report of The Judicial Conference Ad Hoc
Committee on Asbestos Litigation 2-3 (Mar. 1991) (hereinafter Report)).
We noted in Amchem that the Judicial Conference Ad Hoc Committee
on Asbestos Litigation in 1991 had called for "federal legislation creating
a national asbestos dispute-resolution scheme." 521 U. S., at 528 (citing
Report 3, 27-35). To date Congress has not responded.

of Texas against a group of asbestos manufacturers. App.
to Pet. for Cert. 252a. In the 1970's and 1980's, plaintiffs'
lawyers throughout the country, particularly in East Texas,
honed the litigation of asbestos claims to the point of almost
mechanical regularity, improving the forensic identification of diseases caused by asbestos, refining theories of liability, and often settling large inventories of cases. See
D. Hensler, W. Felstiner, M. Selvin, & P. Ebener, Asbestos
in the Courts: The Challenge of Mass Toxic Torts vii (1985);
McGovern, Resolving Mature Mass Tort Litigation, 69 B. U.
L. Rev. 659, 660-661 (1989); see also App. to Pet. for Cert.
253a.

Respondent Fibreboard Corporation was a defendant in
the 1967 action. Although it was primarily a timber company, from the 1920's through 1971 the company manufactured a variety of products containing asbestos, mainly for
high-temperature industrial applications. As the tide of
asbestos litigation rose, Fibreboard found itself litigating on
two fronts. On one, plaintiffs were filing a stream of personal injury claims against it, swelling throughout the 1980's
and 1990's to thousands of new claims for compensatory damages each year. Id., at 265a; App. 1040a. On the second
front, Fibreboard was battling for funds to pay its tort claimants. From May 1957 through March 1959, respondent Continental Casualty Company had provided Fibreboard with a
comprehensive general liability policy with limits of $1 million per occurrence, $500,000 per claim, and no aggregate
limit. Fibreboard also claimed that respondent Pacific Indemnity Company had insured it from 1956 to 1957 under a
similar policy. App. to Pet. for Cert. 267a-268a. Beginning
in 1979, Fibreboard was locked in coverage litigation with
Continental and Pacific in a California state trial court,
which in 1990 held Continental and Pacific responsible for
indemnification as to any claim by a claimant exposed to Fibreboard asbestos products prior to their policies' respective

Opinion of the Court
expiration dates. Id., at 268a-269a. The decree also re-quired the insurers to pay the full cost of defense for each

claim covered. Ibid. The insurance companies appealed.With asbestos case filings continuing unabated, and its secure insurance assets almost depleted, Fibreboard in 1988began a practice of "structured settlement," paying plaintiffs
40 percent of the settlement figure up front with the balancecontingent upon a successful resolution of the coverage dispute.2 By 1991, however, the pace of filings forced Fibre-board to start settling cases entirely with the assignments of
its rights against Continental, with no initial payment. Toreflect the risk that Continental might prevail in the coverage dispute, these assignment agreements generally carrieda figure about twice the nominal amount of earlier settlements. Continental challenged Fibreboard's right to makeunilateral assignments, but in 1992 a California state court
ruled for Fibreboard in that dispute.3Meanwhile, in the aftermath of a 1990 Federal Judicial
Center conference on the asbestos litigation crisis, Fibre-board approached a group of leading asbestos plaintiffs' lawyers, offering to discuss a "global settlement" of its asbestos

2 Because Fibreboard's insurance policy with Continental expired in
1959, before the global settlement the settlement value of claims by victims exposed to Fibreboard's asbestos prior to 1959 was much higher than
for victims exposed after 1959, where the only right of recovery was
against Fibreboard itself. See In re Asbestos Litigation, 90 F. 3d 963,
1012-1013 (CA5 1996) (Smith, J., dissenting).

3 Id., at 969, and n. 1 (citing Andrus v. Fibreboard, No. 614747-3 (Sup.

Ct., Alameda Cty., June 1, 1992)). Continental appealed, and, after the
Global Settlement Agreement was reached in this case, but before the
fairness hearing, see infra, at 827, a California appellate court reversed.
See 90 F. 3d, at 969, and n. 1 (citing Fibreboard Corp. v. Continental Casualty Co., No. A059716 (Cal. App., Oct. 19, 1994)). Continental and Fibreboard had each brought actions seeking to establish (or challenge) the
validity of Fibreboard's assignment-settlement program, but only Andrus
produced a definitive ruling as opposed to a settlement. See App. to Pet.
for Cert. 288a-290a.

Opinion of the Court
personal-injury liability. Early negotiations bore relatively
little fruit, save for the December 1992 settlement by assignment of a significant inventory of pending claims. This settlement brought Fibreboard's deferred settlement obligations to more than $1.2 billion, all contingent upon victory
over Continental on the scope of coverage and the validity
of the settlement assignments.

In February 1993, after Continental had lost on both issues
at the trial level, and thus faced the possibility of practically
unbounded liability, it too joined the global settlement negotiations. Because Continental conditioned its part in any
settlement on a guarantee of "total peace," ensuring no unknown future liabilities, talks focused on the feasibility of a
mandatory class action, one binding all potential plaintiffs
and giving none of them any choice to opt out of the certified
class. Negotiations continued throughout the spring and
summer of 1993, but the difficulty of settling both actually
pending and potential future claims simultaneously led to an
agreement in early August to segregate and settle an inventory of some 45,000 pending claims, being substantially all
those filed by one of the plaintiffs' firms negotiating the
global settlement. The settlement amounts per claim were
higher than average, with one-half due on closing and the
remainder contingent upon either a global settlement or Fibreboard's success in the coverage litigation. This agreement provided the model for settling inventory claims of
other firms.

With the insurance companies' appeal of the consolidated
coverage case set to be heard on August 27, the negotiating
parties faced a motivating deadline, and about midnight before the argument, in a coffee shop in Tyler, Texas, the negotiators finally agreed upon $1.535 billion as the key term of
a "Global Settlement Agreement." $1.525 billion of this sum
would come from Continental and Pacific, in the proportion
established by the California trial court in the coverage case,

Opinion of the Court
while Fibreboard would contribute $10 million, all but
$500,000 of it from other insurance proceeds, App. 84a. The
negotiators also agreed to identify unsettled present claims
against Fibreboard and set aside an as-then unspecified fund
to resolve them, anticipating that the bulk of any excess
left in that fund would be transferred to class claimants.
Ahearn v. Fibreboard Corp., 162 F. R. D. 505, 517 (ED Tex.
1995). The next day, as a hedge against the possibility that
the Global Settlement Agreement might fail, plaintiffs' counsel insisted as a condition of that agreement that Fibreboard
and its two insurers settle the coverage dispute by what
came to be known as the "Trilateral Settlement Agreement."
The two insurers agreed to provide Fibreboard with funds
eventually set at $2 billion to defend against asbestos claimants and pay the winners, should the Global Settlement
Agreement fail to win approval. Id., at 517, 521; see also
App. to Pet. for Cert. 492a.4

On September 9, 1993, as agreed, a group of named plaintiffs filed an action in the United States District Court for
the Eastern District of Texas, seeking certification for settlement purposes of a mandatory class comprising three groups:
all persons with personal injury claims against Fibreboard
for asbestos exposure who had not yet brought suit or settled
their claims before the previous August 27; those who had
dismissed such a claim but retained the right to bring a future action against Fibreboard; and "past, present and future
spouses, parents, children, and other relatives" of class mem4 Two related settlement agreements accompanied the Global and Trilateral Settlement Agreements. The first, negotiated with representatives
of Fibreboard's major codefendants, preserved credit rights for codefendant third parties, In re Asbestos Litigation, 90 F. 3d 963, 973 (CA5 1996);
the second provided that final approval of the Global Settlement Agreement would not constitute a "settlement" under the Longshore and Harbor
Workers' Compensation Act, 33 U. S. C. $ 933(g), 162 F. R. D., at 521-522.

bers exposed to Fibreboard asbestos.5 The class did not in-clude claimants with actions presently pending against Fibreboard or claimants "who filed and, for cash payment orsome other negotiated value, dismissed claims against Fibreboard, and whose only retained right is to sue Fibreboardupon development of an asbestos-related malignancy."

exposure through the exposure of a spouse, household member or any
other person), to asbestos or to asbestos-containing products for which
Fibreboard may bear legal liability and who have not, before August 27,

liability; or (ii) settled a claim for any asbestos-related personal injury, or
damage, or death arising from such exposure with Fibreboard or with

liability;

Opinion of the Court
at 534a-535a. The complaint pleaded personal injury claims
against Fibreboard, and, as justification for class certification, relied on the shared necessity of ensuring insurance
funds sufficient for compensation. Id., at 552a-569a. After
Continental and Pacific had obtained leave to intervene as
party-defendants, the District Court provisionally granted
class certification, enjoined commencement of further separate litigation against Fibreboard by class members, and appointed a guardian ad litem to review the fairness of the
settlement to the class members. See In re Asbestos Litigation, 90 F. 3d 963, 972 (CA5 1996).

As finally negotiated, the Global Settlement Agreement
provided that in exchange for full releases from class members, Fibreboard, Continental, and Pacific would establish a
trust to process and pay class members' asbestos personal
injury and death claims. Claimants seeking compensation
would be required to try to settle with the trust. If initial
settlement attempts failed, claimants would have to proceed
to mediation, arbitration, and a mandatory settlement conference. Only after exhausting that process could claimants
go to court against the trust, subject to a limit of $500,000
per claim, with punitive damages and prejudgment interest
barred. Claims resolved without litigation would be discharged over three years, while judgments would be paid
out over a 5- to 10-year period. The Global Settlement
Agreement also contained spendthrift provisions to conserve
the trust, and provided for paying more serious claims first
in the event of a shortfall in any given year. Id., at 973.

After an extensive campaign to give notice of the pending
settlement to potential class members, the District Court allowed groups of objectors, including petitioners here, to intervene. After an 8-day fairness hearing, the District Court
certified the class and approved the settlement as "fair,
adequate, and reasonable" under Rule 23(e). Ahearn, 162
F. R. D., at 527. Satisfied that the requirements of Rule

Opinion of the Court
23(a) were met, id., at 523-526,6 the District Court certified
the class under Rule 23(b)(1)(B),7 citing the risk that Fibreboard might lose or fare poorly on appeal of the coverage
case or lose the assignment-settlement dispute, leaving it
without funds to pay all claims. Id., at 526. The "allowance of individual adjudications by class members," the District Court concluded, "would have destroyed the opportunity to compromise the insurance coverage dispute by
creating the settlement fund, and would have exposed the
class members to the very risks that the settlement addresses." Id., at 527. In response to intervenors' objections that the absence of a "limited fund" precluded certification under Rule 23(b)(1)(B), the District Court ruled that
although the subdivision is not so restricted, if it were, this
case would qualify. It found both the "disputed insurance
asset liquidated by the $1.535 billion Global Settlement,"
and, alternatively, "the sum of the value of Fibreboard plus
the value of its insurance coverage," as measured by the
insurance funds' settlement value, to be relevant "limited
funds." App. to Pet. for Cert. 491a-492a.

On appeal, the Fifth Circuit affirmed both as to class certification and adequacy of settlement. In re Asbestos Litiga6 "Rule 23(a) states four threshold requirements applicable to all class
actions: (1) numerosity (a `class [so large] that joinder of all members is
impracticable'); (2) commonality (`questions of law or fact common to the
class'); (3) typicality (named parties' claims or defenses `are typical . . . of
the class'); and (4) adequacy of representation (representatives `will fairly
and adequately protect the interests of the class')." Amchem Products,
Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U. S. 591, 613 (1997).

7 Rule 23(b)(1)(B) provides that "[a]n action may be maintained as a class

action if the prerequisites of subdivision (a) are satisfied, and in addition:
(1) the prosecution of separate actions by or against individual members
of the class would create a risk of . . . (B) adjudications with respect to
individual members of the class which would as a practical matter be dispositive of the interests of the other members not parties to the adjudications or substantially impair or impede their ability to protect their
interests."

Opinion of the Court
tion, supra.8 Agreeing with the District Court's applicationof Rule 23(a), the Court of Appeals found that there was

commonality in class members' shared interest in securingand equitably distributing maximum possible settlement
funds, and that the representative plaintiffs were sufficientlytypical both in sharing that interest and in basing their
claims on the same legal and remedial theories that absentclass members might raise.

Id., at 975-976. The Fifth Cir-cuit also thought that there were no conflicts of interest sufficiently serious to undermine the adequacy of class counsel'srepresentation. Id., at 976-982.

9 As to Rule 23(b)(1)(B),

the court approved the class certification on a "limited fund"rationale based on the threat to "the ability of other members of the class to receive full payment for their injuriesfrom Fibreboard's limited assets." Id., at 982.

10 The Court

of Appeals cited expert testimony that Fibreboard facedenormous potential liabilities and defense costs that would

likely equal or exceed the amount of damages paid out, andconcluded that even combining Fibreboard's value of some
$235 million with the $2 billion provided in the TrilateralSettlement Agreement, the company would be unable to pay
all valid claims against it within five to nine years. Ibid.Judge Smith dissented, arguing among other things that the

8 Continental and Pacific also filed a class action against a defendant
class essentially identical to the plaintiff class in the Global Settlement
Agreement as well as a class of third parties with asbestos-related claims
against Fibreboard, seeking a declaration that the Trilateral Settlement
Agreement was fair and reasonable. The District Court certified the
class and approved the Trilateral Settlement Agreement, which the Fifth
Circuit consolidated with the review of the case below and affirmed. See
In re Asbestos Litigation, 90 F. 3d, at 974, 991-993. That decision is now
final and is not before this Court.

9 As the objectors did not challenge the adequacy of representation of

class representatives, the Fifth Circuit did not consider the issue. Id., at
976, n. 10. Likewise, no party raised concerns with Rule 23(a)'s numerosity requirement.

10 Abandoning the District Court's alternative rationale, the Court of

Appeals rested entirely on a limited fund theory.

majority had skimped on serious due process concerns, hadglossed over problems of commonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation, and had ignored a number of justi-ciability issues. See generally

id., at 993-1026.11
Shortly thereafter, this Court decided Amchem and pro-ceeded to vacate the Fifth Circuit's judgment and remand

for further consideration in light of that decision. 521 U. S.
1114 (1997). On remand, the Fifth Circuit again affirmed,in a brief

per curiam opinion, distinguishing Amchem on
the grounds that the instant action proceeded under Rule23(b)(1)(B) rather than (b)(3), and did not allocate awards according to the nature of the claimant's injury. In re Asbestos Litigation, 134 F. 3d 668, 669-670 (1998). Again citing
the findings on certification under Rule 23(b)(1)(B), the FifthCircuit affirmed as "incontestable" the District Court's conclusion that the terms of the subdivision had been met. Id.,
at 670. The Court of Appeals acknowledged Amchem's ad-monition that settlement class actions may not proceed unless the requirements of Rule 23(a) are met, but noted thatthe District Court had made extensive findings supporting
its Rule 23(a) determinations. Ibid. Judge Smith againdissented, reiterating his previous concerns, and argued specifically that the District Court erred in certifying the classunder Rule 23(b)(1)(B) on a "limited fund" theory because
the only limited fund in the case was a creature of the settlement itself. Id., at 671-674.We granted certiorari, 524 U. S. 936 (1998), and now

reverse. II

The nub of this case is the certification of the class underRule 23(b)(1)(B) on a limited fund rationale, but before we
reach that issue, there are two threshold matters. First,

Opinion of the Court
petitioners call the class claims nonjusticiable under ArticleIII, saying that this is a feigned action initiated by Fibreboard to control its future asbestos tort liability, with the"vast majority" of the "exposure-only" class members being
without injury in fact and hence without standing to sue.Brief for Petitioners 44-50. Ordinarily, of course, this or
any other Article III court must be sure of its own jurisdic-tion before getting to the merits.

Steel Co. v. Citizens ForBetter Environment, 523 U. S. 83, 88-89 (1998). But the

class certification issues are, as they were in Amchem, "logi-cally antecedent" to Article III concerns, 521 U. S., at 612,
and themselves pertain to statutory standing, which mayproperly be treated before Article III standing, see

Steel Co.,supra, at 92. Thus the issue about Rule 23 certification

should be treated first, "mindful that [the Rule's] require-ments must be interpreted in keeping with Article III
constraints . . . ." Amchem, supra, at 612-613.Petitioners also argue that the Fifth Circuit on remand
disregarded Amchem in passing on the Rule 23(a) issues ofcommonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation.
Brief for Petitioners 13-22. We agree that in reinstating itsaffirmance of the District Court's certification decision, the
Fifth Circuit fell short in its attention to Amchem's expla-nation of the governing legal standards. Two aspects in
particular of the District Court's certification should havereceived more detailed treatment by the Court of Appeals.
First, the District Court's enquiry into both commonalityand typicality focused almost entirely on the terms of the
settlement. See Ahearn, 162 F. R. D., at 524.12 Second, andmore significantly, the District Court took no steps at the
outset to ensure that the potentially conflicting interests of

12 In Amchem, the Court found that class members' shared exposure to
asbestos was insufficient to meet the demanding predominance requirements of Rule 23(b)(3). 521 U. S., at 623-624. We left open the possibility, however, that such commonality might suffice for the purposes of Rule
23(a). Ibid.

easily identifiable categories of claimants be protected byprovisional certification of subclasses under Rule 23(c)(4), relying instead on its post hoc findings at the fairness hearingthat these subclasses in fact had been adequately represented. As will be seen, however, these points will reappearwhen we review the certification on the Court of Appeals's
"limited fund" theory under Rule 23(b)(1)(B). We accord-ingly turn directly to that.

A

Although representative suits have been recognized invarious forms since the earliest days of English law, see generally S. Yeazell, From Medieval Group Litigation to theModern Class Action (1987); see also Marcin, Searching for
the Origin of the Class Action, 23 Cath. U. L. Rev. 515, 517-524 (1973), class actions as we recognize them today developed as an exception to the formal rigidity of the necessaryparties rule in equity, see Hazard, Gedid, & Sowle, An Historical Analysis of the Binding Effect of Class Suits, 146U. Pa. L. Rev. 1849, 1859-1860 (1998) (hereinafter Hazard,
Gedid, & Sowle), as well as from the bill of peace, an equita-ble device for combining multiple suits, see Z. Chafee, Some
Problems of Equity 161-167, 200-203 (1950). The necessaryparties rule in equity mandated that "all persons materially
interested, either as plaintiffs or defendants in the subjectmatter of the bill ought to be made parties to the suit, however numerous they may be." West v. Randall, 29 F. Cas.718, 721 (No. 17,424) (CC RI) (1820) (Story, J.). But because
that rule would at times unfairly deny recovery to the partybefore the court, equity developed exceptions, among them
one to cover situations "where the parties are very numer-ous, and the court perceives, that it will be almost impossible
to bring them all before the court; or where the question isof general interest, and a few may sue for the benefit of the
whole; or where the parties form a part of a voluntary associ527US2 Unit: $U92 [05-04-01 14:06:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Id., at 722; see J. Story, Commentaries on Equity Pleadings$ 97 (J. Gould 10th rev. ed. 1892); F. Calvert, A Treatise upon
the Law Respecting Parties to Suits in Equity 17-29 (1837)(hereinafter Calvert, Parties to Suits in Equity). From
these roots, modern class action practice emerged in the 1966revision of Rule 23. In drafting Rule 23(b), the Advisory
Committee sought to catalogue in "functional" terms "thoserecurrent life patterns which call for mass litigation through
representative parties." Kaplan, A Prefatory Note, 10 B. C.
Ind. & Com. L. Rev. 497 (1969).

Rule 23(b)(1)(B) speaks from "a vantage point within theclass, [from which the Advisory Committee] spied out situations where lawsuits conducted with individual members ofthe class would have the practical if not technical effect of
concluding the interests of the other members as well, orof impairing the ability of the others to protect their own
interests." Kaplan, Continuing Work of the Civil Commit-tee: 1966 Amendments of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (I), 81 Harv. L. Rev. 356, 388 (1967) (hereinafter Kaplan,
Continuing Work). Thus, the subdivision (read with subdi-vision (c)(2)) provides for certification of a class whose members have no right to withdraw, when "the prosecution ofseparate actions . . . would create a risk" of "adjudications
with respect to individual members of the class which wouldas a practical matter be dispositive of the interests of the
other members not parties to the adjudications or substan-tially impair or impede their ability to protect their interests." Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23(b)(1)(B).13 Classic examples

13 In contrast to class actions brought under subdivision (b)(3), in cases
brought under subdivision (b)(1), Rule 23 does not provide for absent class
members to receive notice and to exclude themselves from class membership as a matter of right. See 1 H. Newberg & A. Conte, Class Actions

$ 4.01, p. 4-6 (3d ed. 1992) (hereinafter Newberg). It is for this reason
that such cases are often referred to as "mandatory" class actions.

of such a risk of impairment may, for example, be found insuits brought to reorganize fraternal-benefit societies, see,

e. g., Supreme Tribe of Ben-Hur v. Cauble, 255 U. S. 356(1921); actions by shareholders to declare a dividend or otherwise to "fix [their] rights," Kaplan, Continuing Work 388;and actions charging "a breach of trust by an indenture
trustee or other fiduciary similarly affecting the members ofa large class" of beneficiaries, requiring an accounting or similar procedure "to restore the subject of the trust," AdvisoryCommittee's Notes on Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23, 28 U. S. C.
App., p. 696 (hereinafter Adv. Comm. Notes). In each ofthese categories, the shared character of rights claimed or
relief awarded entails that any individual adjudication by aclass member disposes of, or substantially affects, the interests of absent class members.Among the traditional varieties of representative suit encompassed by Rule 23(b)(1)(B) were those involving "thepresence of property which call[ed] for distribution or management," J. Moore & J. Friedman, 2 Federal Practice 2240(1938) (hereinafter Moore & Friedman). One recurring type
of such suits was the limited fund class action, aggregating"claims . . . made by numerous persons against a fund
insufficient to satisfy all claims." Adv. Comm. Notes 697;cf. 1 Newberg $ 4.09, at 4-33 ("Classic" limited fund class
actions "include claimants to trust assets, a bank account,insurance proceeds, company assets in a liquidation sale, proceeds of a ship sale in a maritime accident suit, andothers").

14 The Advisory Committee cited Dickinson v.

14 Indeed, Professor Kaplan, reporter to the Advisory Committee's 1966
revision of Rule 23, commented in a letter to another member of the Advisory Committee that the phrase " `impair or impede the ability of the other
members to protect their interests' " is "redolent of claims against a fund."

Some fund-related class actions involved claims for the creation or preservation of a specific fund subject to the interests of numerous claim527US2 Unit: $U92 [05-04-01 14:06:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
Burnham, 197 F. 2d 973 (CA2), cert. denied, 344 U. S. 875
(1952), as illustrative of this tradition. In Dickinson, investors hoping to save a failing company had contributed some
$600,000, which had been misused until nothing was left but
a pool of secret profits on a fraction of the original investment. In a class action, the District Court took charge of
this fund, subjecting it to a constructive trust for division
among subscribers who demonstrated their claims, in
amounts proportional to each class member's percentage of
all substantiated claims. 197 F. 2d, at 978.15 The Second
Circuit approved the class action and the distribution of the
entire pool to claimants, noting that "[a]lthough none of the
contributors has been paid in full, no one . . . now asserts or
suggests that they should have full recovery . . . as on an
ordinary tort liability for conspiracy and defrauding. The
court's power of disposition over the fund was therefore abants. See, e. g., City & County of San Francisco v. Market Street R. Co.,
95 Cal. App. 2d 648, 213 P. 2d 780 (1950). The rationale in such cases for
representative plaintiffs suing on behalf of all similarly situated potential
parties was that benefits arising from the action necessarily inured to the
class as a whole. Another type of fund case involved the adjudication of
the rights of all participants in a fund in which the participants had common rights. See, e. g., Hartford Life Ins. Co. v. IBS, 237 U. S. 662 (1915);
Supreme Council of Royal Arcanum v. Green, 237 U. S. 531 (1915); Hartford Life Ins. Co. v. Barber, 245 U. S. 146 (1917); see also Smith v. Swormstedt, 16 How. 288 (1854). In such cases, regardless of the size of any
individual claimant's stake, the adjudication would determine the operating rules governing the fund for all participants. This category is more
analogous in modern practice to class actions seeking structural injunctions and is not at issue in this case.

15 The District Court in Dickinson, as was the usual practice in such

cases, distributed the limited fund only after notice had been given to all
class members, allowing them to come into the suit, prove their claim, and
share in the recovery. See 197 F. 2d, at 978; see also Adv. Comm. Notes
697 (describing limited fund class actions as involving an "action by or
against representative members to settle the validity of the claims as a
whole, or in groups, followed by separate proof of the amount of each valid
claim and proportionate distribution of the fund").

solute and final." Id., at 980.16 As the Advisory Committeerecognized in describing Dickinson, equity required absent

parties to be represented, joinder being impractical, whereindividual claims to be satisfied from the one asset would, as
a practical matter, prejudice the rights of absent claimantsagainst a fund inadequate to pay them all.

Equity, of course, recognized the same necessity to bindabsent claimants to a limited fund when no formal imposition
of a constructive trust was entailed. In Guffanti v. National Surety Co., 196 N. Y. 452, 458, 90 N. E. 174, 176 (1909),for example, the defendant received money to supply steamship tickets and had posted a $15,000 bond as required bystate law. He converted to personal use funds collected
from more than 150 ticket purchasers, was then adjudgedbankrupt, and absconded. One of the defrauded ticket purchasers sued the surety in equity on behalf of himself and allothers like him. Over the defendant's objection, the New
York Court of Appeals sustained the equitable class suit, cit-ing among other considerations the fact that all recovery had
to come from a "limited fund out of which the aggregaterecoveries must be sought" that was inadequate to pay all
claims, and subject to pro rata distribution. Id., at 458, 90N. E., at 176. See Hazard, Gedid, & Sowle 1915 ("[Guffanti]

16 As Dickinson demonstrates, the immediate precursor to the type of
limited fund class action invoked in this case was a subset of "hybrid"
class actions under the 1938 version of Rule 23. Cf. 1 Newberg $ 1.09, at
1-25. The original Rule 23 categorized class actions by "the character of
the right sought to be enforced for or against the class," dividing such
actions into "(1) joint, or common, or secondary in the sense that the owner
of a primary right refuses to enforce that right and a member of the class
thereby becomes entitled to enforce it; (2) several, and the object of the
action is the adjudication of claims which do or may affect specific property
involved in the action; or (3) several, and there is a common question of
law or fact affecting the several rights and a common relief is sought."

explained that when a debtor's assets were less than thetotal of the creditors' claims, a binding class action was not

only permitted but was required; otherwise some creditors(the parties) would be paid and others (the absentees) would
not"). See also Morrison v. Warren 174 Misc. 233, 234, 20N. Y. S. 2d 26, 27 (Sup. Ct. N. Y. Cty. 1940) (suit on behalf of
more than 400 beneficiaries of an insurance policy following afire appropriate where "the amount of the claims . . . greatly
exceeds the amount of the insurance"); National Surety Co.v.

Graves, 211 Ala. 533, 534, 101 So. 190 (1924) (suit againsta surety company by stockholders "for the benefit of themselves and all others similarly situate who will join the suit"where it was alleged that individual suits were being filed
on surety bonds that "would result in the exhaustion of thepenalties of the bonds, leaving many stockholders without
remedy").

Ross v. Crary, 1 Paige Ch. 416, 417-418 (N. Y. Ch. 1829),presents the concept of the limited fund class action in another incarnation. "[D]ivers suits for general legacies," id.,at 417, were brought by various legatees against the executor of a decedent's estate. The Ross court stated that where"there is an allegation of a deficiency of the fund, so that an
account of the estate is necessary," the court will "direc[t] anaccount in one cause only" and "stay the proceeding[s] in the
others, leaving all the parties interested in the fund, to comein under the decree."

Id., at 417-418. Thus, in equity, lega-tee and creditor bills against the assets of a decedent's estate

had to be brought on behalf of all similarly situated claimantswhere it was clear from the pleadings that the available portion of the estate could not satisfy the aggregate claimsagainst it.

17 In early creditors' bills, for example, equity would order a master to
call for all creditors to prove their debts, to take account of the entire
estate, and to apply the estate in payment of the debts. See 1 J. Story,

Opinion of the Court

B
The cases forming this pedigree of the limited fund class
action as understood by the drafters of Rule 23 have a num-ber of common characteristics, despite the variety of circumstances from which they arose. The points of resemblanceare not necessarily the points of contention resolved in the
particular cases, but they show what the Advisory Commit-tee must have assumed would be at least a sufficient set of
conditions to justify binding absent members of a class underRule 23(b)(1)(B), from which no one has the right to secede.

The first and most distinctive characteristic is that the totals of the aggregated liquidated claims and the fund available for satisfying them, set definitely at their maximums,
demonstrate the inadequacy of the fund to pay all the claims.
The concept driving this type of suit was insufficiency, which
alone justified the limit on an early feast to avoid a later
famine. See, e. g., Guffanti, supra, at 457, 90 N. E., at 176
("The total amount of the claims exceeds the penalty of the
bond . . . . A just and equitable payment from the bond
would be a distribution pro rata upon the amount of the several embezzlements. Unless in a case like this the amount

creditors was not, however, available when the executor of the estate admitted assets sufficient to cover its debts, because where assets were not
limited, no prejudice to the other creditors would result from the simple
payment of the debt to the creditor who brought the bill. See Woodgate
v. Field, 2 Hare 211, 213, 67 Eng. Rep. 88, 89 (Ch. 1842) ("The reason
for . . . the usual form of decree . . . has no application where assets are
admitted, for the executor thereby makes himself liable to the payment of
the debt. In such a case, the other creditors cannot be prejudiced by a
decree for payment of the Plaintiff's debt; and the object of the special
form of the decree in a creditors' suit fails"); see also Hallett v. Hallett, 2
Paige 15, 21 (N. Y. 1829) ("[I]f by the answer of the defendant [in a creditors' or legatees' suit] it appears there will be a deficiency of assets so that
all the creditors cannot be paid in full, or that there must be an abatement
of the complainant's legacy, the court will make a decree for the general

of the bond is so distributed among the persons havingclaims which are secured thereby, it must necessarily result

in a scramble for precedence in payment, and the amount ofthe bond may be paid to the favored, or to those first obtaining knowledge of the embezzlements"); Graves, supra, at 534,
101 So., at 190 ("The primary equity of the bill is the adjust-ment of claims and the equitable apportionment of a fund

provided by law, which is insufficient to pay claimants infull"). The equity of the limitation is its necessity.

Second, the whole of the inadequate fund was to be de-voted to the overwhelming claims. See,

e. g., Dickinson,
197 F. 2d, at 979-980 (rejecting a challenge by holder of
funds to the court's disposition of the entire fund); see also
United States v. Butterworth-Judson Corp., 269 U. S. 504,
513 (1926) ("Here, the fund being less than the debts, the
creditors are entitled to have all of it distributed among them
according to their rights and priorities"). It went without
saying that the defendant or estate or constructive trustee
with the inadequate assets had no opportunity to benefit
himself or claimants of lower priority by holding back on the
amount distributed to the class. The limited fund cases thus
ensured that the class as a whole was given the best deal;
they did not give a defendant a better deal than seriatim
litigation would have produced.

Third, the claimants identified by a common theory of
recovery were treated equitably among themselves. The
cases assume that the class will comprise everyone who
might state a claim on a single or repeated set of facts, invoking a common theory of recovery, to be satisfied from the
limited fund as the source of payment. Each of the people
represented in Ross, for example, had comparable entitlement as a legatee under the testator's will. Those subject
to representation in Dickinson had a common source of
claims in the solicitation of funds by parties whose subsequent defalcation left them without their investment, while
in Guffanti the individuals represented had each entrusted

money for ticket purchases. In these cases the hope of re-covery was limited, respectively, by estate assets, the residuum of profits, and the amount of the bond. Once the repre-sented classes were so identified, there was no question of
omitting anyone whose claim shared the common theory of
liability and would contribute to the calculated shortfall ofrecovery. See

Railroad Co. v. Orr, 18 Wall. 471, 474 (1873)
(reciting the "well settled" general rule "that when it ap-pears on the face of the bill that there will be a deficiency in

the fund, and that there are other creditors or legatees whoare entitled to a ratable distribution with the complainants,
and who have a common interest with them, such creditorsor legatees should be made parties to the bill, or the suit
should be brought by the complainants in behalf of themselves and all others standing in a similar situation"). Theplaintiff appeared on behalf of all similarly situated parties,

see Calvert, Parties to Suits in Equity 24 ("[I]t is not suffi-cient that the plaintiff appear on behalf of numerous parties:
the rule seems to be, that he must appear on behalf of allwho are interested"); thus, the creditors' bill was brought on
behalf of all creditors, cf. Leigh v. Thomas, 2 Ves. Sen. 312,313, 28 Eng. Rep. 201 (Ch. 1751) ("No doubt but a bill may
be by a few creditors in behalf of themselves and the rest
. . . but there is no instance of a bill by three or four to havean account of the estate, without saying they bring it in

behalf of themselves and the rest of the creditors"), theconstructive trust was asserted on behalf of all victims of
the fraud, and the surety suit was brought on behalf of all
entitled to a share of the bond.18 Once all similar claims

18 Professor Chafee explained, in discussing bills of peace, that where a
case presents a limited fund, "it is impossible to make a fair distribution
of the fund or limited liability to all members of the multitude except in a
single proceeding where the claim of each can be adjudicated with due
reference to the claims of the rest. The fund or limited liability is like a
mince pie, which can not be satisfactorily divided until the carver counts

were brought directly or by representation before the court,these antecedents of the mandatory class action presented

straightforward models of equitable treatment, with the sim-ple equity of a pro rata distribution providing the required
fairness, see 1 J. Pomeroy, Equity Jurisprudence $ 407,pp. 764-765 (4th ed. 1918) ("[I]f the fund is not sufficient to
discharge all claims upon it in full . . . equity will incline toregard all the demands as standing upon an equal footing,
and will decree a pro rata distribution or payment").19In sum, mandatory class treatment through representative
actions on a limited fund theory was justified with referenceto a "fund" with a definitely ascertained limit, all of which
would be distributed to satisfy all those with liquidatedclaims based on a common theory of liability, by an equitable,
pro rata distribution. C

The Advisory Committee, and presumably the Congress inapproving subdivision (b)(1)(B), must have assumed that an
action with these characteristics would satisfy the limited
the number of persons at the table." Bills of Peace with Multiple Parties,
45 Harv. L. Rev. 1297, 1311 (1932).

19 As noted above, traditional limited fund class actions typically provided notice to all claimants and the opportunity for those claimants to
establish their claims before the actual distribution took place. See, e. g.,
Dickinson v. Burnham, 197 F. 2d 973, 978 (CA2 1952); Terry v. President
and Directors of the Bank of Cape Fear, 20 F. 777, 782 (CC WDNC 1884);
cf. Johnson v. Waters, 111 U. S. 640, 674 (1884) (in a creditors' bill, "it is
the usual and correct course to open a reference in the master's office and
to give other creditors, having valid claims against the fund, an opportunity to come in and have the benefit of the decree"). Rule 23, however,
specifies no notice requirement for subdivision (b)(1)(B) actions beyond
that required by subdivision (e) for settlement purposes. Plaintiffs in this
case made an attempt to notify all presently identifiable class members in
connection with the fairness hearing, though the adequacy of the effort is
disputed. Since satisfaction or not of a notice requirement would not affect the disposition of this case, we express no opinion on the need for
notice or the sufficiency of the effort to give it in this case.

Opinion of the Court
fund rationale cognizable under that subdivision. The ques-tion remains how far the same characteristics are necessary

for limited fund treatment. While we cannot settle all thedetails of a subdivision (b)(1)(B) limited fund here (and so
cannot decide the ultimate question whether settlements of
multitudes of related tort actions are amenable to mandatoryclass treatment), there are good reasons to treat these characteristics as presumptively necessary, and not merely suffi-cient, to satisfy the limited fund rationale for a mandatory
action. At the least, the burden of justification rests on theproponent of any departure from the traditional norm.

It is true, of course, that the text of Rule 23(b)(1)(B) is on
its face open to a more lenient limited fund concept, just as
it covers more historical antecedents than the limited fund.
But the greater the leniency in departing from the historical
limited fund model, the greater the likelihood of abuse in
ways that will be apparent when we apply the limited fund
criteria to the case before us. The prudent course, therefore, is to presume that when subdivision (b)(1)(B) was devised to cover limited fund actions, the object was to stay
close to the historical model. As will be seen, this limiting
construction finds support in the Advisory Committee's expressions of understanding, minimizes potential conflict with
the Rules Enabling Act, and avoids serious constitutional
concerns raised by the mandatory class resolution of individual legal claims, especially where a case seeks to resolve future liability in a settlement-only action.

To begin with, the Advisory Committee looked cautiously
at the potential for creativity under Rule 23(b)(1)(B), at least
in comparison with Rule 23(b)(3). Although the Committee
crafted all three subdivisions of the Rule in general, practical
terms, without the formalism that had bedeviled the original
Rule 23, see Kaplan, Continuing Work 380-386, the Committee was consciously retrospective with intent to codify preRule categories under Rule 23(b)(1), not forward looking as
it was in anticipating innovations under Rule 23(b)(3). Com527US2 Unit: $U92 [05-04-01 14:06:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN

(Rule 23(b)(3) is "an evolving area"). Thus, the Committeeintended subdivision (b)(1) to capture the " `standard' " class
actions recognized in pre-Rule practice, Kaplan, ContinuingWork 394.

Consistent with its backward look under subdivision (b)(1),
as commentators have pointed out, it is clear that the Advisory Committee did not contemplate that the mandatory
class action codified in subdivision (b)(1)(B) would be used to
aggregate unliquidated tort claims on a limited fund rationale. See Monaghan, Antisuit Injunctions and Preclusion

created by the litigation itself "); see also Schwarzer, Settlement of Mass Tort Class Actions: Order Out of Chaos, 80

None of the examples cited in the Advisory Committee Notes
or by Professor Kaplan in explaining Rule 23(b)(1)(B) remotely approach what was then described as a "mass accident" case. While the Advisory Committee focused much
attention on the amenability of Rule 23(b)(3) to such cases,

Opinion of the Court
the Committee's debates are silent about resolving tortclaims under a mandatory limited fund rationale under Rule

23(b)(1)(B).20 It is simply implausible that the AdvisoryCommittee, so concerned about the potential difficulties
posed by dealing with mass tort cases under Rule 23(b)(3),with its provisions for notice and the right to opt out, see
Rule 23(c)(2), would have uncritically assumed that manda-tory versions of such class actions, lacking such protections,
could be certified under Rule 23(b)(1)(B).21 We do not, it istrue, decide the ultimate question whether Rule 23(b)(1)(B)
may ever be used to aggregate individual tort claims,cf.

Ticor Title Ins. Co. v. Brown, 511 U. S. 117, 121 (1994)

20 To the extent that members of the Advisory Committee explicitly considered cases resembling the current mass tort limited fund class action,
they did so in the context of the debate about bringing "mass accident"
class actions under Rule 23(b)(3). There was much concern on the Advisory Committee about the degree to which subdivision (b)(3), which the
Committee was drafting to replace the old spurious class action category,
would be applied to "mass accident" cases. Compare, e. g., Civil Rules
Meeting 9, 14, with, e. g., id., at 13, 44-45. See also id., at 51. As a
compromise, the Advisory Committee Notes state that a " `mass accident'
resulting in injuries to numerous persons is ordinarily not appropriate for
a class action because of the likelihood that significant questions, not only
of damages but of liability and defenses of liability, would be present, affecting the individuals in different ways." Adv. Comm. Notes 697. See
also Kaplan, Continuing Work 393.

21 The Advisory Committee noted, moreover, that "[w]here the classaction character of the lawsuit is based solely on the existence of a `limited
fund,' the judgment, while extending to all claims of class members
against the fund, has ordinarily left unaffected the personal claims of nonappearing members against the debtor." Adv. Comm. Notes 698. Cf.
Bone, Personal and Impersonal Litigative Forms: Reconceiving the History of Adjudicative Representation, 70 B. U. L. Rev. 213, 282 (1990) (historically suits involving individual claims in the absence of a common fund
did not automatically bind class members, instead providing a mechanism
for notice and the opportunity to join the suit). This recognition underscores doubt that the Advisory Committee would have intended liberality
in allowing such a circumscribed tradition to be transmogrified by operation of Rule 23(b)(1)(B) into a mechanism for resolving the claims of individuals not only against the fund, but also against an individual tortfeasor.

(per curiam). But we do recognize that the Committeewould have thought such an application of the Rule surprising, and take this as a good reason to limit any surprise bypresuming that the Rule's historical antecedents identify
requirements.

The Rules Enabling Act underscores the need for caution.As we said in

Amchem, no reading of the Rule can ignore
the Act's mandate that "rules of procedure `shall not abridge,enlarge or modify any substantive right,' "

Amchem, 521
U. S., at 613 (quoting 28 U. S. C. $ 2072(b)); cf. Guaranty
Trust Co. v. York, 326 U. S. 99, 105 (1945) ("In giving federal
courts `cognizance' of equity suits in cases of diversity jurisdiction, Congress never gave, nor did the federal courts ever
claim, the power to deny substantive rights created by State
law or to create substantive rights denied by State law").
Petitioners argue that the Act has been violated here, asserting that the Global Settlement Agreement's priorities of
claims and compromise of full recovery abrogated the state
law that must govern this diversity action under 28 U. S. C.

$ 1652. See Brief for Petitioners 31-36. Although we need
not grapple with the difficult choice-of-law and substantive
state-law questions raised by petitioners' assertion, we do
need to recognize the tension between the limited fund class
action's pro rata distribution in equity and the rights of individual tort victims at law. Even if we assume that some
such tension is acceptable under the Rules Enabling Act, it
is best kept within tolerable limits by keeping limited fund
practice under Rule 23(b)(1)(B) close to the practice preceding its adoption.

Finally, if we needed further counsel against adventurous
application of Rule 23(b)(1)(B), the Rules Enabling Act and
the general doctrine of constitutional avoidance would jointly
sound a warning of the serious constitutional concerns that
come with any attempt to aggregate individual tort claims
on a limited fund rationale. First, the certification of a mandatory class followed by settlement of its action for money

damages obviously implicates the Seventh Amendment jurytrial rights of absent class members.

22 We noted in Ross v.

Bernhard, 396 U. S. 531 (1970), that since the merger of lawand equity in 1938, it has become settled among the lower

courts that "class action plaintiffs may obtain a jury trial onany legal issues they present."

Id., at 541. By its nature,however, a mandatory settlement-only class action with legal

issues and future claimants compromises their SeventhAmendment rights without their consent.

Second, and no less important, mandatory class actions ag-gregating damages claims implicate the due process "principle of general application in Anglo-American jurisprudencethat one is not bound by a judgment

in personam in a litiga-tion in which he is not designated as a party or to which he

has not been made a party by service of process," Hansberryv. Lee, 311 U. S. 32, 40 (1940), it being "our `deep-rooted historic tradition that everyone should have his own day incourt,' " Martin v. Wilks, 490 U. S. 755, 762 (1989) (quoting
18 C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice andProcedure $ 4449, p. 417 (1981)); see

Richards v. JeffersonCounty, 517 U. S. 793, 798-799 (1996). Although " `[w]e have

recognized an exception to the general rule when, in certainlimited circumstances, a person, although not a party, has his
interests adequately represented by someone with the sameinterests who is a party," or "where a special remedial
scheme exists expressly foreclosing successive litigation bynonlitigants, as for example in bankruptcy or probate,"

Mar-tin, supra, at 762, n. 2 (citations omitted), the burden of justification rests on the exception.The inherent tension between representative suits and the
day-in-court ideal is only magnified if applied to damagesclaims gathered in a mandatory class. Unlike Rule 23(b)(3)
class members, objectors to the collectivism of a mandatory

subdivision (b)(1)(B) action have no inherent right to abstain.The legal rights of absent class members (which in a class

like this one would include claimants who by definition maybe unidentifiable when the class is certified) are resolved regardless of either their consent, or, in a class with objectors,their express wish to the contrary.

23 And in settlement-only

class actions the procedural protections built into the Ruleto protect the rights of absent class members during litigation are never invoked in an adversarial setting, see Amchem, supra, at 620.In related circumstances, we raised the flag on this issue

of due process more than a decade ago in Phillips PetroleumCo. v. Shutts, 472 U. S. 797 (1985). Shutts was a state class
action for small sums of interest on royalty payments sus-pended on the authority of a federal regulation.

Id., at 800.After certification of the class, the named plaintiffs notified

each member by first-class mail of the right to opt out of thelawsuit. Out of a class of 33,000, some 3,400 exercised that
right, and another 1,500 were excluded because their noticescould not be delivered. Id., at 801. After losing at trial,
the defendant, Phillips Petroleum, argued that the statecourt had no jurisdiction over claims of out-of-state plaintiffs
without their affirmative consent. We said no and held thatout-of-state plaintiffs could not invoke the same due process
limits on personal jurisdiction that out-of-state defendantshad under

International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U. S.

23 It is no answer in this case that the settlement agreement provided
for a limited, back-end "opt out" in the form of a right on the part of class
members eventually to take their case to court if dissatisfied with the
amount provided by the trust. The "opt out" in this case requires claimants to exhaust a variety of alternative dispute mechanisms, to bring suit
against the trust, and not against Fibreboard, and it limits damages to
$500,000, to be paid out in installments over 5 to 10 years, see supra, at
827, despite multimillion-dollar jury verdicts sometimes reached in asbestos suits, In re Asbestos Litigation, 90 F. 3d, at 1006-1007, n. 30 (Smith,
J., dissenting). Indeed, on approximately a dozen occasions, Fibreboard
had settled for more than $500,000. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 373a.

was extinguishable due process required that the member"receive notice plus an opportunity to be heard and participate in the litigation," and we said that "at a minimum . . .an absent plaintiff [must] be provided with an opportunity to

The record on which the District Court rested its certifi-cation of the class for the purpose of the global settlement

did not support the essential premises of mandatory limitedfund actions. It failed to demonstrate that the fund was limited except by the agreement of the parties, and it showedexclusions from the class and allocations of assets at odds
with the concept of limited fund treatment and the structuralprotections of Rule 23(a) explained in

Amchem.

A
The defect of certification going to the most characteristicfeature of a limited fund action was the uncritical adoption

by both the District Court and the Court of Appeals of fig-ures

25 agreed upon by the parties in defining the limits of

the fund and demonstrating its inadequacy.26 When a dis24 We also reiterated the constitutional requirement articulated in Hansberry v. Lee, 311 U. S. 32 (1940), that "the named plaintiff at all times
adequately represent the interests of the absent class members." Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts, 472 U. S., at 812 (citing Hansberry, supra, at
42-43, 45). In Shutts, as an important caveat to our holding, we made
clear that we were only examining the procedural protections attendant
on binding out-of-state class members whose claims were "wholly or predominately for money judgments," 472 U. S., at 811, n. 3.

25 The plural reflects the fact that the insurers agreed to provide $1.525

billion under the Global Settlement Agreement and $2 billion under the
Trilateral Settlement Agreement.

26 The federal courts have differed somewhat in articulating the standard to evaluate whether, in fact, a fund is limited, in cases involving mass
torts. Compare, e. g., In re Northern Dist. of California, Dalkon Shield

Opinion of the Court
trict court, as here, certifies for class action settlement only,the moment of certification requires "heightene[d] attention," Amchem, 521 U. S., at 620, to the justifications forbinding the class members. This is so because certification
of a mandatory settlement class, however provisional technically, effectively concludes the proceeding save for the finalfairness hearing. And, as we held in

Amchem, a fairness
hearing under Rule 23(e) is no substitute for rigorous adher-ence to those provisions of the Rule "designed to protect

absentees," ibid., among them subdivision (b)(1)(B).27 Thus,in an action such as this the settling parties must present
not only their agreement, but evidence on which the districtcourt may ascertain the limit and the insufficiency of the
fund, with support in findings of fact following a proceedingin which the evidence is subject to challenge, see

In re Bendectin Products Liability Litigation, 749 F. 2d 300, 306 (CA6

In re Bendectin Products Liability Litigation, 749 F. 2d 300, 306 (CA6

assets are potentially available to suitors"); In re Dennis
Greenman Securities Litigation, 829 F. 2d 1539, 1546 (CA111987) (discussing factual findings necessary for certification

of a limited fund class action).We have already alluded to the difficulties facing limited
fund treatment of huge numbers of actions for unliquidateddamages arising from mass torts, the first such hurdle being
a computation of the total claims. It is simply not a matterof adding up the liquidated amounts, as in the models of limited fund actions. Although we might assume, arguendo,that prior judicial experience with asbestos claims would
allow a court to make a sufficiently reliable determinationof the probable total, the District Court here apparently
thought otherwise, concluding that "there is no way to pre-dict Fibreboard's future asbestos liability with any certainty." 162 F. R. D., at 528. Nothing turns on this conclu-sion, however, since there was no adequate demonstration of
the second element required for limited fund treatment, theupper limit of the fund itself, without which no showing of
insufficiency is possible.The "fund" in this case comprised both the general assets
of Fibreboard and the insurance assets provided by thetwo policies, see 90 F. 3d, at 982 (describing the fund as Fibreboard's entire equity and $2 billion in insurance assetsunder the Trilateral Settlement Agreement). As to Fibreboard's assets exclusive of the contested insurance, the Dis-trict Court and the Fifth Circuit concluded that Fibreboard
had a then-current sale value of $235 million that could bedevoted to the limited fund. While that estimate may have
been conservative,28 at least the District Court heard evi28 The District Court based the $235 million figure on evidence provided

dence and made an independent finding at some point in theproceedings. The same, however, cannot be said for the

value of the disputed insurance.The insurance assets would obviously be "limited" in the
traditional sense if the total of demonstrable claims would
render the insurers insolvent, or if the policies provided ag-gregate limits falling short of that total; calculation might be

difficult, but the way to demonstrate the limit would be clear.Neither possibility is presented in this case, however. Instead, any limit of the insurance asset here had to be a prod-uct of potentially unlimited policy coverage discounted by
the risk that Fibreboard would ultimately lose the coveragedispute litigation. This sense of limit as a value discounted
by risk is of course a step removed from the historical model,
but even on the assumption that it would suffice for limitedfund treatment, there was no adequate finding of fact to support its application here. Instead of undertaking an inde-pendent evaluation of potential insurance funds, the District
Court (and, later, the Court of Appeals), simply accepted the$2 billion Trilateral Settlement Agreement figure as representing the maximum amount the insurance companies couldbe required to pay tort victims, concluding that "[w]here insurance coverage is disputed, it is appropriate to value the
insurance asset at a settlement value." App. to Pet. forCert. 492a.

Settlement value is not always acceptable, however. Onemay take a settlement amount as good evidence of the maximum available if one can assume that parties of equal knowl-edge and negotiating skill agreed upon the figure through
arms-length bargaining, unhindered by any considerationstugging against the interests of the parties ostensibly represented in the negotiation. But no such assumption may beindulged in this case, or probably in any class action settlement with the potential for gigantic fees.30 In this case, cer-tainly, any assumption that plaintiffs' counsel could be of a
mind to do their simple best in bargaining for the benefit ofthe settlement class is patently at odds with the fact that at
least some of the same lawyers representing plaintiffs andthe class had also negotiated the separate settlement of
45,000 pending claims, 90 F. 3d, at 969-970, 971, the fullpayment of which was contingent on a successful Global Settlement Agreement or the successful resolution of the insur-ance coverage dispute (either by litigation or by agreement,
as eventually occurred in the Trilateral Settlement Agree-ment), id., at 971, n. 3; App. 119a-120a. Class counsel thus
had great incentive to reach any agreement in the globalsettlement negotiations that they thought might survive
a Rule 23(e) fairness hearing, rather than the best possiblearrangement for the substantially unidentified global settlement class. Cf. Cramton, Individualized Justice, Mass
ment Agreement would be available to class claims. In re Asbestos Litigation, 90 F. 3d, at 982. The Court of Appeals provided no explanation
for using the higher figure in light of the District Court's conclusion that
only $1.535 billion of the $2 billion Trilateral Settlement Agreement figure
would actually be available to the class. Either way, the figure represented only the amount the insurance companies agreed to pay, and not an
independent evaluation of the limits of their payment obligations.

30 In a strictly rational world, plaintiffs' counsel would always press for

the limit of what the defense would pay. But with an already enormous
fee within counsel's grasp, zeal for the client may relax sooner than it
would in a case brought on behalf of one claimant.

Torts, and "Settlement Class Actions": An Introduction, 80
Cornell L. Rev. 811, 832 (1995) ("[S]ide settlements suggest
that class counsel has been laboring under an impermissible
conflict of interest and that it may have preferred the interests of current clients to those of the future claimants in the
settlement class"). The resulting incentive to favor the
known plaintiffs in the earlier settlement was, indeed, an
egregious example of the conflict noted in Amchem resulting
from divergent interests of the presently injured and future
claimants. See 521 U. S., at 626-627 (discussing adequacy of
named representatives under Rule 23(a)(4)).

We do not, of course, know exactly what an independent
valuation of the limit of the insurance assets would have
shown. It might have revealed that even on the assumption
that Fibreboard's coverage claim was sound, there would be
insufficient assets to pay claims, considered with reference
to their probable timing; if Fibreboard's own assets would
not have been enough to pay the insurance shortfall plus any
claims in excess of policy limits, the projected insolvency of
the insurers and Fibreboard would have indicated a truly
limited fund. (Nothing in the record, however, suggests
that this would have been a supportable finding.) Or an independent valuation might have revealed assets of insufficient value to pay all projected claims if the assets were
discounted by the prospects that the insurers would win
the coverage cases. Or the court's independent valuation
might have shown, discount or no discount, the probability
of enough assets to pay all projected claims, precluding certification of any mandatory class on a limited fund rationale.
Throughout this litigation the courts have accepted the assumption that the third possibility was out of the question,
and they may have been right. But objecting and unidentified class members alike are entitled to have the issue settled
by specific evidentiary findings independent of the agreement of defendants and conflicted class counsel.

Opinion of the Court

B
The explanation of need for independent determination ofthe fund has necessarily anticipated our application of the

requirement of equity among members of the class. Thereare two issues, the inclusiveness of the class and the fairness
of distributions to those within it. On each, this certificationfor settlement fell short.

The definition of the class excludes myriad claimants withcauses of action, or foreseeable causes of action, arising from
exposure to Fibreboard asbestos. While the class includesthose with present claims never filed, present claims withdrawn without prejudice, and future claimants, it fails toinclude those who had previously settled with Fibreboard
while retaining the right to sue again "upon development ofan asbestos related malignancy," plaintiffs with claims pending against Fibreboard at the time of the initial announce-ment of the Global Settlement Agreement, and the plaintiffs
in the "inventory" claims settled as a supposedly necessarystep in reaching the global settlement, see 90 F. 3d, at 971.
The number of those outside the class who settled with areservation of rights may be uncertain, but there is no such
uncertainty about the significance of the settlement's exclu-sion of the 45,000 inventory plaintiffs and the plaintiffs in the
unsettled present cases, estimated by the Guardian Ad Litemat more than 53,000 as of August 27, 1993, see App. in
No. 95-40635 (CA5), 6 Record, Tab 55, p. 72 (Report of theGuardian Ad Litem). It is a fair question how far a natural
class may be depleted by prior dispositions of claims and stillqualify as a mandatory limited fund class, but there can be
no question that such a mandatory settlement class will not
qualify when in the very negotiations aimed at a class settle-ment, class counsel agree to exclude what could turn out

to be as much as a third of the claimants that negotiatorsthought might eventually be involved, a substantial number
of whom class counsel represent, see App. to Pet. for Cert.

Opinion of the Court
321a (noting that the parties negotiating the global settlement agreed to use a negotiating benchmark of 186,000
future claims against Fibreboard).

Might such class exclusions be forgiven if it were shown
that the class members with present claims and the outsiders
ended up with comparable benefits? The question is academic here. On the record before us, we cannot speculate
on how the unsettled claims would fare if the global settlement were approved, or under the trilateral settlement. As
for the settled inventory claims, their plaintiffs appeared to
have obtained better terms than the class members. They
received an immediate payment of 50 percent of a settlement
higher than the historical average, and would get the remainder if the global settlement were sustained (or the coverage litigation resolved, as it turned out to be by the Trilateral Settlement Agreement); the class members, by contrast,
would be assured of a 3-year payout for claims settled,
whereas the unsettled faced a prospect of mediation followed
by arbitration as prior conditions of instituting suit, which
would even then be subject to a recovery limit, a slower payout, and the limitations of the trust's spendthrift protection.
See supra, at 827. Finally, as discussed below, even ostensible parity between settling nonclass plaintiffs and class members would be insufficient to overcome the failure to provide
the structural protection of independent representation as
for subclasses with conflicting interests.

On the second element of equity within the class, the fairness of the distribution of the fund among class members,
the settlement certification is likewise deficient. Fair treatment in the older cases was characteristically assured by
straightforward pro rata distribution of the limited fund.
See supra, at 841. While equity in such a simple sense is
unattainable in a settlement covering present claims not specifically proven and claims not even due to arise, if at all,
until some future time, at the least such a settlement must

Opinion of the Court
seek equity by providing for procedures to resolve the diffi-cult issues of treating such differently situated claimants

with fairness as among themselves.First, it is obvious after Amchem that a class divided between holders of present and future claims (some of the lat-ter involving no physical injury and attributable to claimants
not yet born) requires division into homogeneous subclassesunder Rule 23(c)(4)(B), with separate representation to eliminate conflicting interests of counsel. See Amchem, 521U. S., at 627 (class settlements must provide "structural assurance of fair and adequate representation for the diversegroups and individuals affected"); cf. 5 J. Moore, T. Chorvat,
D. Feinberg, R. Marmer, & J. Solovy, Moore's Federal Prac-tice $ 23.25[5][e], p. 23-149 (3d ed. 1998) (an attorney who
represents another class against the same defendant may notserve as class counsel).

31 As we said in Amchem, "for the

currently injured, the critical goal is generous immediatepayments," but "[t]hat goal tugs against the interest of

exposure-only plaintiffs in ensuring an ample, inflation-protected fund for the future." 521 U. S., at 626. No such
procedure was employed here, and the conflict was as con-trary to the equitable obligation entailed by the limited fund

31 This adequacy of representation concern parallels the enquiry required at the threshold under Rule 23(a)(4), but as we indicated in Amchem, the same concerns that drive the threshold findings under Rule 23(a)
may also influence the propriety of the certification decision under the
subdivisions of Rule 23(b). See Amchem, 521 U. S., at 623, n. 18.

In Amchem, we concentrated on the adequacy of named plaintiffs, but
we recognized that the adequacy of representation enquiry is also concerned with the "competency and conflicts of class counsel." Id., at 626,
n. 20 (citing General Telephone Co. of Southwest v. Falcon, 457 U. S. 147,
157-158, n. 13 (1982)); see also 5 Moore's Federal Practice $ 23.25[3][a] (adequacy of representation concerns named plaintiff and class counsel). In
this case, of course, the named representatives were not even "named
[until] after the agreement in principle was reached," App. to Pet. for
Cert. 483a; and they then relied on class counsel in subsequent settlement
negotiations, ibid.

Opinion of the Court
rationale as it was to the requirements of structural protection applicable to all class actions under Rule 23(a)(4).

Second, the class included those exposed to Fibreboard's
asbestos products both before and after 1959. The date is
significant, for that year saw the expiration of Fibreboard's
insurance policy with Continental, the one that provided the
bulk of the insurance funds for the settlement. Pre-1959
claimants accordingly had more valuable claims than post1959 claimants, see 90 F. 3d, at 1012-1013 (Smith, J., dissenting), the consequence being a second instance of disparate
interests within the certified class. While at some point
there must be an end to reclassification with separate counsel, these two instances of conflict are well within the requirement of structural protection recognized in Amchem.

It is no answer to say, as the Fifth Circuit said on remand,
that these conflicts may be ignored because the settlement
makes no disparate allocation of resources as between the
conflicting classes. See 134 F. 3d, at 669-670. The settlement decides that the claims of the immediately injured deserve no provisions more favorable than the more speculative claims of those projected to have future injuries, and
that liability subject to indemnification is no different from
liability with no indemnification. The very decision to treat
them all the same is itself an allocation decision with results
almost certainly different from the results that those with
immediate injuries or claims of indemnified liability would
have chosen.

Nor does it answer the settlement's failures to provide
structural protections in the service of equity to argue that
the certified class members' common interest in securing
contested insurance funds for the payment of claims was
so weighty as to diminish the deficiencies beneath recognition here. See Brief for Respondent Class Representatives
Ahearn et al. 31 (discussing this issue in the context of the
Rule 23(a)(4) adequacy of representation requirement); id.,

at 35-36 (citing, e. g., In re "Agent Orange" Product LiabilityLitigation, 996 F. 2d 1425, 1435-1436 (CA2 1993); In re

"Agent Orange" Product Liability Litigation, 800 F. 2d 14,18-19 (CA2 1986)). This argument is simply a variation of
the position put forward by the proponents of the settlementin

Amchem, who tried to discount the comparable failure inthat case to provide separate representatives for subclasses

with conflicting interests, see Brief for Petitioners in Am-chem Products, Inc. v. Windsor, O. T. 1996, No. 96-270, p. 48
(arguing that "achieving a global settlement" was "an over-riding concern that all plaintiffs [held] in common"); see also
id., at 42 (arguing that the requirement of Rule 23(b)(3) thatthere be predominance of common questions of law or fact
had been met by shared interest in "the fairness of the set-tlement"). The current position is just as unavailing as its
predecessor in Amchem. There we gave the argument noweight, see 521 U. S., at 625-628, observing that "[t]he benefits asbestos-exposed persons might gain from the establish-ment of a grand-scale compensation scheme is a matter fit
for legislative consideration," but the determination whether"proposed classes are sufficiently cohesive to warrant adjudication" must focus on "questions that preexist any settle-ment," id., at 622-623.

32 Here, just as in the earlier case,

the proponents of the settlement are trying to rewrite Rule23; each ignores the fact that Rule 23 requires protections

under subdivisions (a) and (b) against inequity and potentialinequity at the precertification stage, quite independently of
the required determination at postcertification fairness re-view under subdivision (e) that any settlement is fair in an
overriding sense. A fairness hearing under subdivision (e)can no more swallow the preceding protective requirements

32 We made this observation in the context of Rule 23(b)(3)'s predominance enquiry, see Amchem, 521 U. S., at 622-623, and noted that no " `limited fund' capable of supporting class treatment under Rule 23(b)(1)(B)"
was involved, id., at 623, n. 19.

Opinion of the Court
of Rule 23 in a subdivision (b)(1)(B) action than in one under
subdivision (b)(3).33

C

A third contested feature of this settlement certification
that departs markedly from the limited fund antecedents is
the ultimate provision for a fund smaller than the assets understood by the Court of Appeals to be available for payment
of the mandatory class members' claims; most notably, Fibreboard was allowed to retain virtually its entire net worth.
Given our treatment of the two preceding deficiencies of the
certification, there is of course no need to decide whether
this feature of the agreement would alone be fatal to the
Global Settlement Agreement. To ignore it entirely, however, would be so misleading that we have decided simply to
identify the issue it raises, without purporting to resolve it
at this time.

Fibreboard listed its supposed entire net worth as a component of the total (and allegedly inadequate) assets available for claimants, but subsequently retained all but $500,000

33 As a variation of the argument that class members' common interest
in securing the insurance settlement overrode any internal conflicts, respondents put forth an alternative rationale for sustaining the certification
in this case under Rule 23(b)(1)(B). They assert that "failure by the class
to file and maintain a class action to resolve the coverage disputes on a
unitary basis--allowing class members instead to prosecute their claims
separately--would have put class members to the `significant risk[s]' that
Fibreboard would lose its claimed insurance as a result of the coverage
disputes," and that "any separate action by any class member could have
itself resulted in an adjudication that the insurers owed no coverage to
Fibreboard . . . ." Brief for Respondents Continental et al. 25 (quoting
Rule 23(b)(1)(B)). Whatever its merits, this rationale for certification is
foreclosed by the class conflicts, rehearsed above, that tainted the negotiation of the global settlement, and that at this point cannot be undone.
Thus, whether a mandatory class could now be certified without the excluded inventory plaintiffs (whose settlements would appear to be final),
or with properly represented subclasses, is an issue we need not address.

Opinion of the Court
of that equity for itself.34 On the face of it, the arrangementseems irreconcilable with the justification of necessity in

denying any opportunity for withdrawal of class memberswhose jury trial rights will be compromised, whose damages
will be capped, and whose payments will be delayed. With
Fibreboard retaining nearly all its net worth, it hardly ap-pears that such a regime is the best that can be provided for

class members. Given the nature of a limited fund and theneed to apply its criteria at the certification stage, it is not
enough for a District Court to say that it "need not ensurethat a defendant designate a particular source of its assets
to satisfy the class' claims; [but only that] the amount recov-ered by the class [be] fair."

Ahearn, 162 F. R. D., at 527.
The District Court in this case seems to have had a further
point in mind, however. One great advantage of class actiontreatment of mass tort cases is the opportunity to save the

enormous transaction costs of piecemeal litigation, an advantage to which the settlement's proponents have referred in
this case.35 Although the District Court made no specific

34 We need not decide here how close to insolvency a limited fund defendant must be brought as a condition of class certification. While there is
no inherent conflict between a limited fund class action under Rule
23(b)(1)(B) and the Bankruptcy Code, cf., e. g., In re Drexel Burnham
Lambert Group, Inc., 960 F. 2d 285, 292 (CA2 1992), it is worth noting
that if limited fund certification is allowed in a situation where a company
provides only a de minimis contribution to the ultimate settlement fund,
the incentives such a resolution would provide to companies facing tort
liability to engineer settlements similar to the one negotiated in this case
would, in all likelihood, significantly undermine the protections for creditors built into the Bankruptcy Code. We note further that Congress in
the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994, Pub. L. 103-394, $ 111(a), amended
the Bankruptcy Code to enable a debtor in a Chapter 11 reorganization in
certain circumstances to establish a trust toward which the debtor may
channel future asbestos-related liability, see 11 U. S. C. $$ 524(g), (h).

35 Some courts certifying limited fund class actions have focused on the

advantages such suits have in reducing transaction costs when compared
to piecemeal litigation. See, e. g., In re Drexel Burnham Lambert Group,
Inc., supra, at 292 (certifying mandatory class in part because "some mem527US2 Unit: $U92 [05-04-01 14:06:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
finding about the transaction cost saving likely from thisclass settlement, estimating the amount in the "hundreds of

millions," id., at 529, it did conclude that the amount wouldexceed Fibreboard's net worth as the Court valued it, ibid.
(Fibreboard's net worth of $235 million "is considerably lessthan the likely savings in defense costs under the Global Settlement"). If a settlement thus saves transaction costs thatwould never have gone into a class member's pocket in the
absence of settlement, may a credit for some of the savingsbe recognized in a mandatory class action as an incentive to
settlement? It is at least a legitimate question, which weleave for another day.

V
Our decision rests on a different basis from the ground of
Justice Breyer's dissent, just as there was a difference inapproach between majority and dissenters in

Amchem. Thenub of our position is that we are bound to follow Rule 23 as

we understood it upon its adoption, and that we are not freeto alter it except through the process prescribed by Congress in the Rules Enabling Act. Although, as the dissentnotes,

post, at 882, the revised text adopted in 1966 was un-derstood (somewhat cautiously) to authorize the courts to

provide for class treatment of mass tort litigation, it was also
bers of the putative class might attempt to maintain costly individual actions in the hope and, perhaps, the belief that their claims are more meritorious than the claims of other class members," and thus warranting
mandatory class certification "to prevent claimants with such motivations
from unfairly diminishing the eventual recovery of other class members").
Although the transaction costs Fibreboard faced prior to settlement were
at times significant, see Ahearn, 162 F. R. D., at 509; see also App. to Pet.
for Cert. 282a (Fibreboard's annual asbestos litigation defense costs ran,
at times, as high as twice the total face value of settlements reached),
given the exigencies of Fibreboard's contingent insurance asset, this case
does not present an instance in which limited fund certification can be
justified on the ground that such settlement necessarily provided funds
equal to, or greater than, what might have been recovered through individual litigation factoring out transaction costs.

862 ORTIZ v. FIBREBOARD CORP.

Opinion of the Court
the Court's understanding that the Rule's growing edge forthat purpose would be the opt-out class authorized by subdivision (b)(3), not the mandatory class under subdivision(b)(1)(B), see

supra, at 843-844. While we have not ruled
out the possibility under the present Rule of a mandatory
class to deal with mass tort litigation on a limited fund ra-tionale, we are not free to dispense with the safeguards that

have protected mandatory class members under that theorytraditionally.

Apart from its effect on the requirements of subdivision(a) as explained and held binding in

Amchem, the dissent
would move the standards for mandatory actions in the direction of opt-out class requirements by according weight to
this "unusual limited fund['s] . . . witching hour," post, at 877,
in exercising discretion over class certification. It is on this
belief (that we should sustain the allowances made by the
District Court in consideration of the exigencies of this settlement proceeding) that the dissent addresses each of the
criteria for limited fund treatment (demonstrably insufficient
fund, intraclass equity, and dedication of the entire fund, see
post, at 873-883).

As to the calculation of the fund, the dissent believes an
independent valuation by the District Court may be dispensed with here in favor of the figure agreed upon by the
settling parties. The dissent discounts the conflicts on the
part of class counsel who negotiated the Global Settlement
Agreement by arguing that the "relevant" settlement negotiation, and hence the relevant benchmark for judging the
actual value of the insurance amount, was the negotiation
between Fibreboard and the insurers that produced the Trilateral Settlement Agreement. See post, at 876. This argument, however, minimizes two facts: (1) that Fibreboard and
the insurers made this separate, backup agreement only at
the insistence of class counsel as a condition for reaching the
Global Settlement Agreement; (2) even more important, that
"[t]he Insurers were . . . adamant that they would not agree

527US2 Unit: $U92 [05-04-01 14:06:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN

863Cite as: 527 U. S. 815 (1999)
Opinion of the Court
to pay any more in the context of a backup agreement thanin a global agreement," a principle "Fibreboard acceded to"

on the day the Global Settlement Agreement was announced"as the price of permitting an agreement to be reached with
respect to a global settlement," Ahearn, 162 F. R. D., at 516.
Under these circumstances the reliability of the TrilateralSettlement Agreement's figure is inadequate as an independent benchmark that might excuse the want of any independ-ent judicial determination that the Global Settlement Agreement's fund was the maximum possible. In any event, thedissent says, it is not crucial whether a $30 claim has to settle
for $15 or $20. But it is crucial. Conflict-free counsel, as
required by Rule 23(a) and Amchem, might have negotiated
a $20 figure, and a limited fund rationale for mandatory class
treatment of a settlement-only action requires assurance that
claimants are receiving the maximum fund, not a potentially
significant fraction less.

With respect to the requirement of intraclass equity, the
dissent argues that conflicts both within this certified class
and between the class as certified and those excluded from
it may be mitigated because separate counsel were simply
not to be had in the short time that a settlement agreement
was possible before the argument (or likely decision) in the
coverage case. But this is to say that when the clock is
about to strike midnight, a court considering class certification may lower the structural requirements of Rule 23(a) as
declared in Amchem, and the parallel equity requirements
necessary to justify mandatory class treatment on a limited
fund theory.

Finally, the dissent would excuse Fibreboard's retention of
virtually all its net worth, and the loss to members of the
certified class of some 13 percent of the fund putatively available to them, on the ground that the settlement made more
money available than any other effort would likely have
done. But even if we could be certain that this evaluation
were true, this is to reargue Amchem: the settlement's fair527US2 Unit: $U92 [05-04-01 14:06:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
ness under Rule 23(e) does not dispense with the require-ments of Rules 23(a) and (b).

We believe that if an allowance for exigency can make asubstantial difference in the level of Rule 23 scrutiny, the
economic temptations at work on counsel in class actions willguarantee enough exigencies to take the law back before
Amchem and unsettle the line between mandatory class ac-tions under subdivision (b)(1)(B) and opt-out actions under
subdivision (b)(3). VI

In sum, the applicability of Rule 23(b)(1)(B) to a fund andplan purporting to liquidate actual and potential tort claims
is subject to question, and its purported application in thiscase was in any event improper. The Advisory Committee
did not envision mandatory class actions in cases like thisone, and both the Rules Enabling Act and the policy of avoiding serious constitutional issues counsel against leniency inrecognizing mandatory limited fund actions in circumstances
markedly different from the traditional paradigm. Assum-ing, arguendo, that a mandatory, limited fund rationale could
under some circumstances be applied to a settlement class oftort claimants, it would be essential that the fund be shown
to be limited independently of the agreement of the partiesto the action, and equally essential under Rules 23(a) and
(b)(1)(B) that the class include all those with claims unsatis-fied at the time of the settlement negotiations, with intraclass conflicts addressed by recognizing independentlyrepresented subclasses. In this case, the limit of the fund
was determined by treating the settlement agreement as dis-positive, an error magnified by the representation of class
members by counsel also representing excluded plaintiffs,whose settlements would be funded fully upon settlement of
the class action on any terms that could survive final fairnessreview. Those separate settlements, together with other
exclusions from the claimant class, precluded adequate struc-tural protection by subclass treatment, which was not even

transactional costs will surely consume more and more of arelatively static amount of money to pay these claims.

But we are not free to devise an ideal system for adjudicating these claims. Unless and until the Federal Rules of

This case involves a settlement of an estimated 186,000
potential future asbestos claims against a single company,
Fibreboard, for approximately $1.535 billion. The District
Court, in approving the settlement, made 446 factual findings, on the basis of which it concluded that the settlement

A

Four special background circumstances underlie this settlement and help to explain the reasonableness and consequent lawfulness of the relevant District Court determinations. First, as the majority points out, the settlement
comprises part of an "elephantine mass of asbestos cases,"
which "defies customary judicial administration." Ante, at
821. An estimated 13-to-21 million workers have been exposed to asbestos. See Report of the Judicial Conference
Ad Hoc Committee on Asbestos Litigation 6-7 (Mar. 1991)
(hereinafter Report). Eight years ago the Judicial Conference spoke of the mass of related cases having "reached
critical dimensions," threatening "a disaster of major proportions." Id., at 2. In the Eastern District of Texas, for
example, one out of every three civil cases filed in 1990 was
an asbestos case. See id., at 8. In the past decade nearly
80,000 new federal asbestos cases have been filed; more than
10,000 new federal asbestos cases were filed last year. See
U. S. District Courts Civil Cases Commenced by Nature of
Suit, Administrative Office of the Courts Statistics (Dec. 31,
1994-1998) (Table C2-A) (hereinafter AO Statistics).

The Judicial Conference found that asbestos cases on average take almost twice as long as other lawsuits to resolve.
See Report 10-11. Judge Parker, the experienced trial
judge who approved this settlement, noted in one 3,000-
member asbestos class action over which he presided that
448 of the original class members had died while the litigation was pending. Cimino v. Raymark Industries, Inc., 751
F. Supp. 649, 651 (ED Tex. 1990). And yet, Judge Parker

Breyer, J., dissenting
went on to state, if the District Court could close "thirtycases a month, it would [still] take six and one-half years to

try these cases and [due to new filings] there would be pend-ing over 5,000 untouched cases" at the end of that time.

Id.,
at 652. His subsequent efforts to accelerate final decision
or settlement through the use of sample cases produced ahighly complex trial (133 trial days, more than 500 witnesses,

half a million pages of documents) that eventually closed onlyabout 160 cases because efforts to extrapolate from the sample proved fruitless. See Cimino v. Raymark Industries,
Inc., 151 F. 3d 297, 335 (CA5 1998). The consequence is not
only delay but also attorney's fees and other "transaction
costs" that are unusually high, to the point where, of each
dollar that asbestos defendants pay, those costs consume an
estimated 61 cents, with only 39 cents going to victims. See
Report 13.

Second, an individual asbestos case is a tort case, of a kind
that courts, not legislatures, ordinarily will resolve. It is
the number of these cases, not their nature, that creates the
special judicial problem. The judiciary cannot treat the
problem as entirely one of legislative failure, as if it were
caused, say, by a poorly drafted statute. Thus, when "calls
for national legislation" go unanswered, ante, at 821, judges
can and should search aggressively for ways, within the
framework of existing law, to avoid delay and expense so
great as to bring about a massive denial of justice.

Third, in that search the district courts may take advantage of experience that appellate courts do not have. Judge
Parker, for example, has written of "a disparity of appreciation for the magnitude of the problem," growing out of the
difference between the trial courts' "daily involvement with
asbestos litigation" and the appellate courts' "limited" exposure to such litigation in infrequent appeals. Cimino, 751
F. Supp., at 651.

Fourth, the alternative to class-action settlement is not a
fair opportunity for each potential plaintiff to have his or her

Breyer, J., dissenting
own day in court. Unusually high litigation costs, unusuallylong delays, and limitations upon the total amount of resources available for payment together mean that most po-tential plaintiffs may not have a realistic alternative. And
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 was designed to addresssituations in which the historical model of individual actions would not, for practical reasons, work. See generallyAdvisory Committee's Notes on Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23,
28 U. S. C. App., p. 696 (discussing, in relation to Rule23(b)(1)(B), instances in which individual judgments, "while
not technically concluding the other members, might do soas a practical matter").

For these reasons, I cannot easily find a legal answer tothe problems this case raises by referring, as does the majority, to "our `deep-rooted historic tradition that everyoneshould have his own day in court.' " Ante, at 846 (citation
omitted). Instead, in these circumstances, I believe ourCourt should allow a district court full authority to exercise
every bit of discretionary power that the law provides. Seegenerally

Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U. S. 682, 703 (1979)("[M]ost issues arising under Rule 23 . . . [are] committed in

the first instance to the discretion of the district court");Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U. S. 330, 345 (1979) (district
courts have "broad power and discretion . . . with respect tomatters involving the certification" of class actions). And,
in doing so, the Court should prove extremely reluctant tooverturn a fact-specific or circumstance-specific exercise of
that discretion, where a court of appeals has found it lawful.Cf.

Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, 340 U. S. 474, 490-491(1951) (Supreme Court will rarely overturn appellate court

review of agency factfinding). This cautionary principle ofreview leads me to an ultimate conclusion different from that
of the majority. B

The case before us involves a class of individuals (and theirfamilies) exposed to asbestos manufactured by Fibreboard

Breyer, J., dissenting
who, for the most part, had not yet sued or settled with Fi-breboard as of August 1993. The negotiating parties estimated that Fibreboard faced approximately 186,000 of thesefuture claims. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 321a; cf. AO Statistics, Table C2-A (total number of all civil cases filed in
federal district courts in 1998 was 252,994). Although theDistrict Court was unable to give a precise figure, see App.

to Pet. for Cert. 356a-357a, there is no doubt that a realisticassessment of the value of these claims far exceeds Fibreboard's total net worth.But, as of 1993, one potentially short-lived additional asset
promised potential claimants a greater recovery. That asset
consisted of two insurance policies, one issued by Continental
Casualty, the other by Pacific Indemnity. If the policies
were valid (i. e., if they covered most of the relevant claims),
they were worth several billion dollars; but if they were invalid, this asset was worth nothing. At that time, a separate case brought by Fibreboard against the insurance companies in California state court seemed likely to resolve the
value of the policies in the near future. That separate litigation had a settlement value for the insurance companies. At
the time the parties were negotiating, prior to the California
court's decision, the insurance policies were worth, as the
majority puts it, the value of "unlimited policy coverage"
(i. e., perhaps the insurance companies' entire net worth)
"discounted by the risk that Fibreboard would ultimately
lose the coverage dispute litigation." Ante, at 851.

The insurance companies offered to settle with both Fibreboard and those persons with claims against Fibreboard (who
might have tried to sue the insurance companies directly).
The settlement negotiations came to a head in August 1993,
just as a California state appeals court was poised to decide
the validity of the insurance policies. This fact meant speed
was important, for the California court could well decide that
the policies were worth nothing. It also meant that it was
important to certify a non-opt-out class of Fibreboard plain527US2 Unit: $U92 [05-04-01 14:06:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN
870 ORTIZ v. FIBREBOARD CORP.

Breyer, J., dissenting
tiffs. If the class that entered into the settlement were anopt-out class, then members of that class could wait to see

what the California court did. If the California court foundthe policies valid (hence worth many billions of dollars), they
would opt out of the class and sue for everything they could
get; if the California court found the policies invalid (andworth nothing), they would stick with the settlement. The

insurance companies would gain little from that kind of set-tlement, and they would not agree to it. See

In re Asbestos
Litigation, 90 F. 3d 963, 970 (CA5 1996).After eight days of hearings, the District Court found that

the insurance policies plus Fibreboard's net worth amounted
to a "limited fund," valued at $1.77 billion (the amount the
insurance companies were willing to contribute to the settlement plus Fibreboard's value). See App. to Pet. for Cert.
492a. The court entered detailed factual findings. See generally 162 F. R. D., at 518-519. It certified a "non-opt-out"
class. And the court approved the parties' Global Settlement Agreement. The Global Settlement Agreement allows
those exposed to asbestos (and their families) to assert their
Fibreboard claims against a fund that it creates. It does not
limit recoveries for particular types of claims, but allows for
individual determinations of damages based on all historically relevant individual factors and circumstances. See 90
F. 3d, at 976. It contains spendthrift provisions designed to
limit the total payouts for any particular year, and a requirement that the claimants with the most serious injuries be
paid first in any year in which there is a shortfall. It also
permits an individual who wishes to retain his right to bring
an ordinary action in court to opt out of the arrangement
(albeit after mediation and nonbinding arbitration), but sets
a ceiling of $500,000 upon the recovery obtained by any person who does so. See generally 162 F. R. D., at 518-519.

The question here is whether the court's certification of
the class under Rule 23(b)(1)(B) violates the law. The majority seems to limit its holding (though not its discussion)

Breyer, J., dissenting
to that question, and so I limit the focus of my dissent to theRule 23(b)(1)(B) issues as well.

II
The District Court certified a class consisting primarilyof individuals (and their families) who had been exposed to

Fibreboard's asbestos but who had not yet made claims.See ante, at 825-827, and n. 5. It did so under the authority
of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(1)(B), which, byanalogy to pre-Rules "limited fund" cases, permits certification of a non-opt-out class where

"the prosecution of separate actions by or against indi-vidual members of the class would create a risk of . . .

adjudications with respect to individual members of theclass which would as a practical matter be dispositive of
the interests of the other members not parties to theadjudications or substantially impair or impede their
ability to protect their interests."
The majority thinks this class could not be certified underRule 23(b)(1)(B). I, on the contrary, think it could.

The case falls within the Rule's language as long as therewas a significant "risk" that the total assets available to satisfy the claims of the class members would fall well belowthe likely total value of those claims, for in such circumstances the money would go to those claimants who broughttheir actions first, thereby " `substantially impair[ing]' " the
" `ability' " of later claimants " `to protect their interests.' "And the District Court found there was indeed such a
" `risk.' " 162 F. R. D., at 526.Conceptually speaking, that "risk" was no different from
the risk inherent in a classic pre-Rules "limited fund" case.Suppose a broker agrees to invest the funds of 10 individuals
who each give the broker $100. The broker misuses themoney, and the customers sue. (1) Suppose their claims
total $1,000, but the broker's total assets amount to $100.

Breyer, J., dissenting
(2) Suppose the same broker has no assets left, but he doeshave an insurance policy worth $100. (3) Suppose the broker has both $100 in assets and a $100 insurance policy.The first two cases are classic limited fund cases. See
ante, at 834-836 (citing, e. g., Dickinson v. Burnham, 197
F. 2d 973 (CA2 1952), cert. denied, 344 U. S. 875 (1952), aninvestors' suit for the return of misused funds);

ante, at 837
(citing, e. g., Morrison v. Warren, 174 Misc. 233, 234, 20N. Y. S. 2d 26, 27 (Sup. Ct. N. Y. Cty. 1940), a suit to distribute insurance proceeds to third party beneficiaries). Thethird case simply combines the first two, and that third case
is the case before us.

Of course the value of the insurance policies in our case is
not as precise as the $100 in my example, nor was it certain
at the time of settlement. But that uncertainty makes no
difference. It was certain that the insurance policies' value
was limited. And that limitation was created by the likelihood of an independent judicial determination of the meaning
of words in the policy, in respect to which the merits or value
of the underlying tort claims against Fibreboard were beside
the point.

Nor does it matter that the value of the insurance policies
in our case might have fluctuated over time. Long before
the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, courts permitted actions by one group of insurance policyholders to bind all
policyholders, even where the group proceeded against an
insurance-company-administered fund that fluctuated over
time. See Hartford Life Ins. Co. v. IBS, 237 U. S. 662, 672
(1915) (life insurance fund which, like the fund before us, was
administered through court-ordered rules that bound all
policyholders).

Neither does it matter that the insurance policies might
be worth much more money if the California court decided
the coverage dispute in Fibreboard's favor. A trust worth,
say, $1 million (faced with $2 million in claims) is a limited
fund, despite the possibility that a company whose stock it

Breyer, J., dissenting
holds might strike oil and send the value of the trust skyrocketing. Limitation is a matter of present value, which
takes appropriate account of such future possibilities.

I need not pursue the conceptual matter further, however,
for the majority apparently concedes the conceptual point
that a fund's limit may equal its "value discounted by risk."
Ante, at 851. But the majority sets forth three additional
conditions that it says are "sufficient . . . to justify binding
absent members of a class under Rule 23(b)(1)(B), from which
no one has the right to secede." Ante, at 838. The three
are:

Condition One: That "the totals of the aggregated liquidated claims and the fund available for satisfying them,
set definitely at their maximums, demonstrate the inadequacy of the fund to pay all the claims." Ibid.; Part
IV-A, ante.

Condition Two: That "the claimants identified by a common theory of recovery were treated equitably among
themselves." Ante, at 839; Part IV-B, ante.

Condition Three: That "the whole of the inadequate
fund was to be devoted to the overwhelming claims."
Ante, at 839; Part IV-C, ante.

I shall discuss each condition in turn.

A
In my view, the first condition is substantially satisfied.
No one doubts that the "totals of the aggregated" claims well
exceed the value of the assets in the "fund available for satisfying them," at least if the fund totaled about what the
District Court said it did, namely, $1.77 billion at most. The
District Court said that the limited fund equaled in value
"the sum of the value of Fibreboard plus the value of its
insurance coverage," or $235 million plus $1.535 billion.

Breyer, J., dissenting
the finding. 90 F. 3d, at 982. And the finding is ade-quately supported.

The District Court found that the insurance policies werenot worth substantially more than $1.535 billion in part because there was a "significant risk" that the insurance policies would soon turn out to be worth nothing at all. 162F. R. D., at 526. The court wrote that "Fibreboard might

lose" its coverage, i. e., that it might lose "on one or moreissues in the [California] Coverage Case, or that Fibreboard
might lose its insurance coverage as a result of its assign-ment settlement program."

Ibid.
Two California insurance law experts, a Yale professor and
a former state court of appeals judge, testified that there
was a good chance that Fibreboard would lose all or a significant part of its insurance coverage once the California
appellate courts decided the matter. 90 F. 3d, at 974. And
that conclusion is not surprising. The Continental policy
(for which Fibreboard had paid $10,000 per year) carried limits of $500,000 "per-person" and $1 million "per-occurrence,"
had been in effect only between May 1957 and March 1959,
and arguably denied Fibreboard the right to settle tort cases
as it had been doing. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 267a. The
Pacific policy was said (no one could find a copy) to carry a
$500,000 per-claim limit, and had been in effect only for one
year, from 1956 to 1957. See ibid. To win significantly in
respect to either of the two policies, Fibreboard had to show
that the policies fully covered a person exposed to asbestos
long before the policy year (say, in 1948) even if the disease
did not appear until much later (say, in 2002). It also had
to explain away the $1 million per occurrence limit in the
Continental policy, despite policy language defining "one occurrence" as " `[a]ll . . . exposure to substantially the same
general conditions existing at or emanating from each premises location.' " Brief for Respondents Continental Casualty
et al. 5. And Fibreboard had to show that its tort-suit settlement practice was consistent with the policy.

875Cite as: 527 U. S. 815 (1999)
Breyer, J., dissenting
The settlement value of previous cases also indicated thatthe insurance policies were of limited value. Fibreboard's

"no-cash" settlements (which required a settling plaintiff toobtain recovery from the insurance companies) were twice
as high on average as were its comparable 40% cash settlements. App. to Pet. for Cert. 231a. That difference, sug-gesting a 50% discount for 40% cash, in turn suggests that

settling parties estimated the odds of recovering on the in-surance policies as worse than 2 to 1 against.

The District Court arrived at the present value of the poli-cies ($1.535 billion) by looking to a different settlement, the
settlement arrived at in the insurance coverage case itself asa result of bargaining between Fibreboard and the insurance
companies. See id., at 492a. That settlement, embodied in
the Trilateral Agreement, created a backup fund by takingfrom the insurance companies $1.535 billion (plus other

money used to satisfy claims not here at issue) and simplysetting it aside to use for the payment of claims brought
against Fibreboard in the ordinary course by members ofthis class (in the event that the federal courts ultimately
failed to approve the Global Settlement Agreement).The Fifth Circuit approved this method of determining the
value of the insurance policies. See 90 F. 3d, at 982 (discussing value of Trilateral Agreement plus value of Fibreboard).And the majority itself sees nothing wrong with that method

in principle. The majority concedes that one

"may take a settlement amount as good evidence of the
maximum available if one can assume that parties ofequal knowledge and negotiating skill agreed upon the

figure through arms-length bargaining, unhindered by
any considerations tugging against the interests of

the parties ostensibly represented in the negotiation."
Ante, at 852.

The majority rejects the District Court's valuation for a
different reason. It says that the settlement negotiation

527US2 Unit: $U92 [05-04-01 14:06:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN
876 ORTIZ v. FIBREBOARD CORP.

Breyer, J., dissenting
that led to the valuation was not necessarily a fair one. Themajority says it cannot make the necessary "arms-length

bargaining" assumption because "[c]lass counsel" had a"great incentive to reach any agreement" in light of the fact
that "some of the same lawyers . . . had also negotiated the
separate settlement of 45,000" pending cases, which waspartially contingent upon a global settlement or other favorable resolution of the insurance dispute. Ibid. (emphasisadded).

The District Court and Court of Appeals, however, did ac-cept the relevant "arms-length" assumption, with good reason. The relevant bargaining (i. e., the bargaining that led
to the Trilateral Agreement that set the policies' value) was
not between the plaintiffs' class counsel and the insurance
companies; it was between Fibreboard and the insurance
companies. And there is no reason to believe that that bargaining, engaged in to settle the California coverage dispute,
was not "arms length." That bargaining did not lead to a
settlement that would release Fibreboard from potential tort
liability. Rather, it led to a potential backup settlement that
did not release Fibreboard from anything. It created a fund
of insurance money, which, once exhausted, would have left
Fibreboard totally exposed to tort claims. Consequently,
Fibreboard had every incentive to squeeze as much money
as possible out of the insurance companies, thereby creating
as large a fund as possible in order to diminish the likelihood
that it would eventually have to rely upon its own net worth
to satisfy future asbestos plaintiffs.

Nor are petitioners correct when they argue that the insurance companies' participation in setting the value of the
insurance policies created a fund that is limited "only in the
sense that . . . every settlement is limited." Brief for Petitioners 28. As the District Court found, the fund was limited by the value of the insurance policies (along with Fibreboard's own limited net worth), and that limitation arose out
of the independent likelihood that the California courts

877Cite as: 527 U. S. 815 (1999)
Breyer, J., dissenting
would find the policies valueless. App. to Pet. for Cert.492a. That is why the District Court said that certification

in this case does not determine whether

"mandatory class certification is appropriate in the typical case where a class action is settled with a defendant'sown funds, or with insurance funds that are not the subject of genuine and vigorous dispute." 162 F. R. D., at527.

The court added that, in the ordinary case: "If the settlementfailed[,] . . . the defendant would retain the settlement funds
(or the insurance coverage), and there might not be the `im-pair[ment]' to class members' `ability to protect their interests' required for mandatory class certification." Ibid. Inthis case, however, if settlement failed, coverage "[might]
well disappear . . . with the result that Class members could
not then secure their due through litigation." Ibid.I recognize that one could reasonably argue about whether

the total value of the insurance policies (plus the value ofFibreboard) is $1.535 billion, $1.77 billion, $2.2 billion, or
some other roughly similar number. But that kind of argu-ment, in this case, is like arguing about whether a trust fund,
facing $30,000 in claims, is worth $15,000 or $20,000 (e. g., dowe count Aunt Agatha's share as part of the fund?), or
whether a ship, subject to claims that, by any count, exceed
its value, is worth a little more or a little less (e. g., does thecoal in the hold count as fuel, which is part of the ship's value,

or as cargo, which is not?). A perfect valuation, requiringlengthy study by independent experts, is not feasible in the
context of such an unusual limited fund, one that comes accompanied with its own witching hour. Within weeks after
the parties' settlement agreement, the insurance policies
might well have disappeared, leaving most potential plaintiffs with little more than empty claims. The ship was about
to sink, the trust fund to evaporate; time was important.
Under these circumstances, I would accept the valuation

findings made by the District Court and affirmed by theCourt of Appeals as legally sufficient. See supra, at 868.

B
I similarly believe that the second condition is satisfied.The "claimants . . . were treated equitably among themselves." Ante, at 839. The District Court found equitabletreatment, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. But a majority of this Court now finds significant inequities arising outof class counsel's "egregious" conflict of interest, the settlement's substantive terms, and the District Court's failure tocreate subclasses. See

ante, at 854-859. But nothing I canfind in the Court's opinion, nor in the objectors' briefs, convinces me that the District Court's findings on these matterswere clearly erroneous, or that the Court of Appeals went
seriously astray in affirming them.The District Court made 76 separate findings of fact, for
example, in respect to potential conflicts of interest. App.to Pet. for Cert. 392a-430a. Of course, class counsel consisted of individual attorneys who represented other asbes-tos claimants, including many other Fibreboard claimants
outside the certified class. Since Fibreboard had been set-tling cases contingent upon resolution of the insurance dispute for several years, any attorney who had been involvedin previous litigation against Fibreboard was likely to suffer
from a similar "conflict." So whom should the DistrictCourt have appointed to negotiate a settlement that had to
be reached soon, if ever? Should it have appointed attor-neys unfamiliar with Fibreboard and the history of its asbestos litigation? Where was the District Court to find thosecompetent, knowledgeable, conflict-free attorneys? The
District Court said they did not exist. Finding of Fact || 372says there is "no credible evidence of the existence of other
`conflict-free' counsel who were qualified to negotiate" a set-tlement within the necessary time.

"crucial . . . to appoint asbestos attorneys who were experi-enced, knowledgeable, skilled and credible in view of the extremely short window of opportunity to negotiate a globalsettlement, and the very high risk to future claimants presented by the Coverage Case appeal." Id., at 401a. Where
is the clear error?The majority emphasizes the fact that, by settling the

claims of a class that consisted, for the most part, of personswho had not yet asserted claims against Fibreboard, counsel
assured the availability of funds to pay other clients whohad already asserted those claims.

Ante, at 852-853. The
decision to split the latter "inventory" claims from the for-mer "class" claims, however, reflected the suggestion, not of

class counsel, but of a judge, Circuit Judge Patrick Higginbotham, who had become involved in efforts to produce a timelysettlement. Judge Higginbotham thought that negotiations

had broken down because the combined class was "too com-plex." App. to Pet. for Cert. 316a-317a; see also

id., at 397a.
He thought "inventory" claim settlements could be used asbenchmarks to determine future class claim values,

id., at
316a-317a, and that is just what happened. Although themajority is concerned that "inventory" plaintiffs "appeared

to have obtained better terms than the class members," ante,
at 855, Finding of Fact || 329 says that class counsel

"used the higher-than-average [inventory plaintiff set-tlement values] . . . to achieve a global settlement for

future claimants at similarly high values, effectively arguing they could not possibly accept less for a class offuture claimants than they had just negotiated for their

present clients." App. to Pet. for Cert. 407a.
In addition, more than 150 findings of fact, made after an
8-day hearing, support the District Court's finding that overall the settlement is "fair, adequate, and reasonable." See
id., at 500a-501a. And, of course, Finding of Fact || 318 says

ventory clients--would have " `jeopardiz[ed] any effort at se-rious negotiations' " and "resulted in a less favorable settlement" for the class, or perhaps no settlement followed by noinsurance policy either.

Id., at 402a.
The Fifth Circuit found that "[t]he record amply supports"
these District Court findings. 90 F. 3d, at 978. Does themajority mean to set them aside? If not, does it mean to

set forth a rigid principle of law, such as the principle thatasbestos lawyers with clients outside a class, who will potentially benefit from a class settlement, can never represent aclass in settlement negotiations? And does that principle
apply no matter how unusual the circumstances, or no matter
how necessary that representation might be? Why should
there be such a rule of law? If there is not an absolute rule,
however, I do not see how this Court can hold that the case
before us is not that unusual situation.

Consider next the claim that "equity" required more subclasses. Ante, at 855-857. To determine the "right" number
of subclasses, a district court must weigh the advantages and
disadvantages of bringing more lawyers into the case. The
majority concedes as much when it says "at some point there
must be an end to reclassification with separate counsel."
Ante, at 857. The District Court said that if there had "been
as many separate attorneys" as the objectors wanted, "there
is a significant possibility that a global settlement would not
have been reached before the Coverage Case was resolved
by the California Court of Appeal." App. to Pet. for Cert.
428a. Finding of Fact || 346 lists the shared common interests among subclasses that argue for single representation,
including "avoiding the potentially disastrous results of a
loss . . . in the Coverage Case," "maximizing the total settlement contribution," "reducing transaction costs and delays,"
"minimizing . . . attorney's fees," and "adopting" equitable
claims payment "procedures." Id., at 415a. Surely the District Court was within its discretion to conclude that "the
point" to which the majority alludes was reached in this case.

I need not go into further detail here. Findings of Fact
|||| 347-354 explain why the alleged conflict between pre- and
post-1959 claimants is not significant. Id., at 415a-418a
(noting that "the decision as to how to divide the settlement
among class members" did not take place until after the Trilateral Agreement was agreed to, at which point money was
available equally to both pre- and post-1959 claimants).
Findings of Fact |||| 355-363 explain why the alleged conflict
between claimants with, and those without, current illnesses
is not significant. Id., at 419a-422a (explaining why "the interest of the two subgroups at issue here coincide to a far
greater extent than they diverge"). The Fifth Circuit found
that the District Court "did not abuse its discretion in finding
that the class was adequately represented and that subclasses were not required." 90 F. 3d, at 982. This Court
should not overturn these highly circumstance-specific

judgments.

C

The majority's third condition raises a more difficult question. It says that the "whole of the inadequate fund" must
be "devoted to the overwhelming claims." Ante, at 839 (emphasis added). Fibreboard's own assets, in theory, were
available to pay tort claims, yet they were not included in
the global settlement fund. Is that fact fatal?

I find the answer to this question in the majority's own
explanation. It says that the third condition helps to guarantee that those who held the

"inadequate assets had no opportunity to benefit [themselves] or claimants of lower priority by holding back on
the amount distributed to the class. The limited fund
cases thus ensured that the class as a whole was given
the best deal; they did not give a defendant a better
deal than seriatim litigation would have produced."

Breyer, J., dissenting
That explanation suggests to me that Rule 23(b)(1)(B) per-mits a slight relaxation of this absolute requirement, where

its basic purpose is met, i. e., where there is no doubt that"the class as a whole was given the best deal," and where
there is good reason for allowing the third condition's substantial, rather than its literal, satisfaction.Rule 23 itself does not require modern courts to trace

every contour of ancient case law with literal exactness.Benjamin Kaplan, Reporter to the Advisory Committee on
Civil Rules that drafted the 1966 revisions, upon whom themajority properly relies for explanation, see,

e. g., ante, at
833, 834, 842-843, wrote of Rule 23:

"The reform of Rule 23 was intended to shake the law
of class actions free of abstract categories . . . and torebuild the law on functional lines responsive to those

recurrent life patterns which call for mass litigationthrough representative parties. . . . And whereas the
old Rule had paid virtually no attention to the practical
administration of class actions, the revised Rule dweltlong on this matter--not, to be sure, by prescribing detailed procedures, but by confirming the courts' broadpowers and inviting judicial initiative." A Prefatory
Note, 10 B. C. Ind. & Com. L. Rev. 497 (1969).
The majority itself recognizes the possibility of providing incentives to enter into settlements that reduce costs by grant-ing a "credit" for cost savings by relaxing the whole-of-theassets requirement, at least where most of the savings wouldgo to the claimants.

Ante, at 861.
There is no doubt in this case that the settlement made
far more money available to satisfy asbestos claims than was
likely to occur in its absence. And the District Court found
that administering the fund would involve transaction costs
of only 15%. App. to Pet. for Cert. 362a. A comparison of
that 15% figure with the 61% transaction costs figure applicable to asbestos cases in general suggests hundreds of mil527US2 Unit: $U92 [05-04-01 14:06:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN

lions of dollars in savings--an amount greater than Fibre-board's net worth. And, of course, not only is it better for

the injured plaintiffs, it is far better for Fibreboard, its em-ployees, its creditors, and the communities where it is located
for Fibreboard to remain a working enterprise, rather thanslowly forcing it into bankruptcy while most of its money is
spent on asbestos lawyers and expert witnesses. I wouldconsequently find substantial compliance with the majority's
third condition.Because I believe that all three of the majority's conditions
are satisfied, and because I see no fatal conceptual difficulty,I would uphold the determination, made by the District
Court and affirmed by the Court of Appeals, that the insur-ance policies (along with Fibreboard's net value) amount to
a classic limited fund within the scope of Rule 23(b)(1)(B).

Petitioners raise additional issues, which the majority doesnot reach. I believe that respondents would likely prevail

were the Court to reach those issues. That is why I dissent.But, as the Court does not reach those issues, I need not
decide the questions definitively.In some instances, my belief that respondents would likely
prevail reflects my reluctance to second-guess a court ofappeals that has affirmed a district court's fact- and
circumstance-specific findings. See supra, at 868; cf. Am-chem Products, Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U. S. 591, 629-630 (1997)
(Breyer, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).That reluctance applies to those of petitioners' further claims
that, in effect, attack the District Court's conclusions relatedto: (1) the finding under Rule 23(a)(2) that there are "questions of law and fact common to the class," see App. to Pet.for Cert. 480a; see generally

Amchem, supra, at 634-636(
Breyer, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part); (2)the finding under Rule 23(a)(3) that claims of the representative parties are "typical" of the claims of the class, see App.

to Pet. for Cert. 480a-481a; (3) the adequacy of "notice" toclass members pursuant to Rule 23(e) and the Due Process

Clause, see id., at 511a; see generally Amchem, supra, at640-641 (

Breyer, J., concurring in part and dissenting inpart); and (4) the standing-related requirement that each

class member have a good-faith basis under state law forclaiming damages for some form of injury-in-fact (even if
only for fear of cancer or medical monitoring), see App. toPet. for Cert. 252a; cf., e. g., Coover v. Painless Parker, Dentist, 105 Cal. App. 110, 286 P. 1048 (1930).In other instances, my belief reflects my conclusion that
class certification here rests upon the presence of what isclose to a

traditional limited fund. And I doubt that peti-tioners' additional arguments that certification violates, for

example, the Rules Enabling Act, the Bankruptcy Act, theSeventh Amendment, and the Due Process Clause are aimed
at, or would prevail against, a traditional limited fund (e. g.,"trust assets, a bank account, insurance proceeds, company
assets in a liquidation sale, proceeds of a ship sale in a mari-time accident suit,"

ante, at 834 (internal quotation marksand citations omitted)). Cf. In re Asbestos Litigation, 90

F. 3d, at 986 (noting that Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts,472 U. S. 797 (1985), involved a class certified under the
equivalent of Rule 23(b)(3), not a limited fund case underRule 23(b)(1)(B)). Regardless, I need not decide these latter
issues definitively now, and I leave them for another day.With that caveat, I respectfully dissent.

Per Curiam

WHITFIELD v. TEXAS
on motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis

No. 98-9085. Decided June 24, 1999*
Pro se petitioner seeks leave to proceed in forma pauperis on this

certiorari petition. The instant petition brings his total number of
frivolous filings to nine.

Held: Petitioner's motion to proceed in forma pauperis is denied. He is

barred from filing any further petitions for certiorari or extraordinary
writs in noncriminal cases unless he first pays the docketing fee and
submits his petition in compliance with this Court's Rule 33.1. See
Martin v. District of Columbia Court of Appeals, 506 U. S. 1.

Motions denied.

Per Curiam.
Pro se petitioner Whitfield seeks leave to proceed informa pauperis under Rule 39 of this Court. We deny this

request as frivolous pursuant to Rule 39.8. Whitfield isallowed until July 15, 1999, within which to pay the docketing fee required by Rule 38 and to submit his petition incompliance with this Court's Rule 33.1. We also direct the
Clerk not to accept any further petitions for certiorari or
petitions for extraordinary writs from Whitfield in noncrimi-nal matters unless he first pays the docketing fee required

by Rule 38 and submits his petitions in compliance withRule 33.1.

Whitfield has repeatedly abused this Court's certiorari andextraordinary writ processes. On March 30, 1998, we invoked Rule 39.8 to deny Whitfield in forma pauperis statuswith respect to a petition for certiorari. See

Whitfield v.
Johnson, 523 U. S. 1044. At that time, Whitfield had filed
three petitions for certiorari and three petitions for extraor*Together with Whitfield v. Texas (see this Court's Rule 12.4) and Whitfield v. Texas (see this Court's Rule 12.4), also on motions for leave to

dinary writs, all of which were both patently frivolous andhad been denied without recorded dissent. He thereafter

filed another patently frivolous petition for certiorari, whichwe denied. The instant petition for certiorari thus brings
Whitfield's total number of frivolous filings to nine.We enter the order barring prospective filings for the
reasons discussed in Martin v. District of Columbia Court
of Appeals, 506 U. S. 1 (1992) (per curiam). Whitfield's abuseof the writ of certiorari and of the extraordinary writs has

been in noncriminal cases, and we limit our sanction accord-ingly. The order therefore will not prevent Whitfield from
petitioning to challenge criminal sanctions which might beimposed on him. The order will, however, allow this Court
to devote its limited resources to the claims of petitionerswho have not abused our processes.

It is so ordered.
Justice Stevens, dissenting.

Justice Thomas, dissenting.
Through the program at issue in this case--a program named,ironically, for Father Joseph Sellinger, a Roman Catholic priest--

the State of Maryland provides financial aid, on a per studentbasis, to a wide range of private colleges. Although many of the
colleges participating in the Sellinger Program are affiliated withreligious institutions, Maryland deemed Columbia Union College,
a private liberal arts college affiliated with the Seventh-day Ad-ventist Church, "too religious" to participate. 159 F. 3d 151, 154-
155 (CA4 1998). Throughout this litigation, Columbia Union Col-lege has maintained that Maryland violated its free speech, free
exercise, and equal protection rights by excluding it from theSellinger Program. The District Court and the Court of Appeals
for the Fourth Circuit agreed that the State's action infringed oneor more of these rights. But, relying on our decision in Roemer v.
Board of Public Works of Md., 426 U. S. 736 (1976) (pluralityopinion), both courts nonetheless concluded that Columbia Union's
exclusion could be justified by Maryland's compelling interest inenforcing the Establishment Clause by ensuring that a "pervasively sectarian" institution did not benefit from public funds.We invented the "pervasively sectarian" test as a way to distinguish between schools that carefully segregate religious andsecular activities and schools that consider their religious and
educational missions indivisible and therefore require religion topermeate all activities. In my view, the "pervasively sectarian"

Thomas, J., dissenting 527 U. S.
test rests upon two assumptions that cannot be squared with ourmore recent jurisprudence. The first of these assumptions is that
the Establishment Clause prohibits government funds from everbenefiting, either directly or indirectly, "religious" activities. See
id., at 755. The other is that any institution that takes religionseriously cannot be trusted to observe this prohibition.

We no longer require institutions and organizations to renouncetheir religious missions as a condition of participating in public

programs. Instead, we have held that they may benefit frompublic assistance that is made available based upon neutral, secular criteria. See Agostini v. Felton, 521 U. S. 203 (1997) (studentsattending religious schools eligible for federal remedial assistance); Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515U. S. 819 (1995) (Christian student organization eligible for student activity funds); Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dist.,509 U. S. 1 (1993) (publicly funded sign language interpreter could
assist student in a Catholic school); Witters v. Washington Dept.of Servs. for Blind, 474 U. S. 481 (1986) (blind student free to
use public vocational assistance to attend bible college). Further-more, the application of the "pervasively sectarian" test in this
and similar cases directly collides with our decisions that haveprohibited governments from discriminating in the distribution
of public benefits based upon religious status or sincerity. SeeRosenberger, supra (invalidating university policy denying student activity funds to Christian student newspaper); Lamb'sChapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School Dist., 508 U. S. 384
(1993) (invalidating "religious use" restriction on public access toschool district property); Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U. S. 263 (1981)
(invalidating policy prohibiting student religious organizationsfrom using public university's facilities).

We should take this opportunity to scrap the "pervasively sec-tarian" test and reaffirm that the Constitution requires, at a minimum, neutrality not hostility toward religion. See Bowen v.Kendrick, 487 U. S. 589, 624-625 (1988) (Kennedy, J., joined by
Scalia, J., concurring). By so doing, we would vindicate Colum-bia Union's right to be free from invidious religious discrimina1 Typical of this assumption is the plurality's statement in Tilton v. Richardson, 403 U. S. 672, 681 (1971), that "[t]here is no evidence that reli-gion seeps into the use of any of these facilities[;] . . . the schools were

characterized by an atmosphere of academic freedom rather than religiousindoctrination."

tion.2 Columbia Union's exclusion from the Sellinger Program"raise[s] the inevitable inference that the disadvantage imposed is
born of animosity to the class of [institutions] affected," namely,those schools that insist upon integrating their religious and secular functions. Romer v. Evans, 517 U. S. 620, 634 (1996); see alsoChurch of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah, 508 U. S. 520,
547 (1993) ("[U]pon even slight suspicion that proposals for stateintervention stem from animosity to religion or distrust of its
practices, all officials must pause to remember their own highduty to the Constitution and to the rights it secures"). We also
would provide the lower courts--which are struggling to recon-cile our conflicting First Amendment pronouncements--with much
needed guidance. Compare Peter v. Wedl, 155 F. 3d 992 (CA81998) (holding that the First Amendment prohibits school district
from denying special education services to a child solely becausehe attends a religious school), and Hartmann v. Stone, 68 F. 3d
973 (CA6 1995) (invalidating policy excluding religious day carecenters from Army program), with

Strout v. Albanese, 178 F. 3d57 (CA1 1999) (upholding state law excluding students who attend

religious schools from education tuition program), and Bagley v.
Raymond School Dept., 1999 ME 60, 728 A. 2d 127 (1999) (same).Although the Court declines to grant certiorari today--perhaps

because this case comes to us in an interlocutory posture--thegrowing confusion among the lower courts illustrates that we
cannot long avoid addressing the important issues that it presents.

Stat.$ 23-3.5-101-106 (1998) (students attending pervasively sectarian colleges ineligible for Colorado Student Incentive Grant Program); Wash. Rev.

are pursuing a course of study leading to a degree in theology, divinity orreligious education").

Justice Thomas, with whom The Chief Justice and JusticeScalia join, dissenting.
The rising incidence of out-of-wedlock births and delinquentfathers has had dire social consequences, including, in one expert's view: "lower newborn health and increased risk of earlyinfant death; retarded cognitive and verbal development; lowered
educational achievement; lowered levels of job attainment; in-creased behavioral problems; lowered ability to control impulses;
warped social development; increased dependence on welfare; in-creased exposure to crime; and increased risk of being physically
or sexually abused." App. to Pet. for Cert. 11 (affidavit of Pat-rick F. Fagan, former Deputy Assistant Secretary for Family and
Social Services Policy, U. S. Dept. of Health and Human Services).The State of Georgia sought to address a particularly disturbing
manifestation of this alarming trend. The General Assembly hadlearned of situations "in which a father of a child, born out of
wedlock had failed to form a substantial parental relationshipwith a child, failed to provide support for the child, or both, and
then came forward seeking to profit from the death of the child."Id., at 19-20 (affidavit of State Rep. William C. Randall). Georgia
amended its inheritance laws to provide that, in cases where afather's paternity has been established, "neither the father nor
any child of the father nor any other paternal kin shall inheritfrom or through a child born out of wedlock if it shall be established by a preponderance of evidence that the father failed orrefused openly to treat the child as his own or failed or refused
to provide support for the child." Ga. Code Ann. $ 53-2-4(b)(2)(1997).

The facts of this case poignantly illustrate the problem thatGeorgia sought to address. In 1997, DeAndre Bernard Hamilton
died tragically in an automobile crash allegedly caused by a man-ufacturing defect. Before DeAndre's death, respondent, his biological father, showed little interest in his son. He had no role

Thomas, J., dissenting1044
in his son's life and had taken no responsibility for his upbringing:According to the petition, respondent had no contact with his son
even though he lived less than one mile away from him. Indeed,respondent only met his son at the age of 15 when DeAndre (along
with other children whom respondent apparently had fathered)confronted him. Respondent never legitimated DeAndre and
never initiated a visit with him. He had no idea when (or if)DeAndre graduated from high school, or, until his death, where
DeAndre attended college. Nevertheless, immediately afterDeAndre died, respondent was the first person--of all the parents whose children were injured or killed--to file a suit seekingmonetary damages for his death.

Petitioner, DeAndre's mother, who reared him for 20 yearsunder these adverse conditions, filed a petition to determine the
rights of heirs. See $ 53-2-20. She contended that because re-spondent completely neglected DeAndre he was not entitled to any
inheritance under $ 53-2-4(b)(2). Respondent argued that $ 53-2-4(b)(2) violated, inter alia, the Equal Protection Clauses of the
United States and Georgia Constitutions. A Georgia SuperiorCourt judge agreed and granted summary judgment to respondent.
The Supreme Court of Georgia affirmed, ruling that $ 53-2-4(b)(2)on its face violated the Equal Protection Clauses of the United
States and Georgia Constitutions. 270 Ga. 519, 510 S. E. 2d 823(1999). The court reasoned that the statute created "a genderbased classification" because it imposed the support obligation onlyon fathers of children born out of wedlock; by contrast, mothers of
these children bore no such support obligations as a condition ofinheritance. Appearing to apply intermediate scrutiny, it stated
that "[a] statute containing a gender-based classification violatesequal protection unless the classification furthers important governmental objectives, and the discriminatory means employed are`substantially related' to the achievement of those governmental
objectives." Id., at 520; 510 S. E. 2d, at 824 (citing Reed v. Reed,404 U. S. 71, 76 (1971); Franklin v. Hill, 264 Ga. 302; 444 S. E.
2d 778 (1994)). Although the court recognized that encouragingfathers to take responsibility for out-of-wedlock children was an
"important interest," it appeared to conclude that Georgia had anequal interest in encouraging such behavior in mothers and, thus,

$ 53-2-4(b)(2) did not adequately advance this important interest.270 Ga., at 520, 510 S. E. 2d, at 824. The court found the State's

argument that mothers are less likely than fathers to abandon chil-dren born out of wedlock to be based on impermissible stereotypes
and overbroad generalizations.This decision arguably is inconsistent with this Court's prior
decisions and, at a minimum, resolves an important question war-ranting this Court's review. Contrary to the Georgia Supreme
Court's conclusion, $ 53-2-4(b)(2) does not necessarily draw agender-based classification but arguably distinguishes between
two different categories of men: fathers who support their childrenborn out of wedlock and fathers who do not. Although our prior
decisions addressing Equal Protection Clause challenges to simi-lar statutes are not entirely clear, they appear to indicate that
heightened scrutiny does not apply. In Quilloin v. Walcott, 434U. S. 246 (1978), we considered a Georgia law requiring both parents' consent to the adoption of children born in wedlock but onlythe mother's consent for children born out of wedlock (unless the
father legitimated the child). We held that the law did not vio-late the Equal Protection Clause, noting that the State "[u]nder
any standard of review" could take into consideration that a delin-quent father, unlike a married (or even divorced) one, had "never
exercised actual or legal custody over his child, and thus ha[d]never shouldered any significant responsibility with respect to
the daily supervision, education, protection, or care of the child."Id., at 256 (emphasis added). Subsequently, in Parham v. Hughes,
441 U. S. 347 (1979), we rejected a challenge to a Georgia law thatprovided that fathers (but not mothers) of out-of-wedlock children
could not inherit from their children unless they had legitimatedthem. Four Justices took the view that the statute did not invidiously discriminate on the basis of sex and, therefore, evaluated thestatute under rational-basis review. Justifying its application of
the rational-basis test, that four-Justice plurality concluded that"the statutory classification does not discriminate against fathers
as a class but instead distinguishes between fathers who havelegitimated their children and those who have not." Id., at 356
(emphasis added). Justice Powell, concurring in the judgment,believed that the statute should be reviewed under intermediate
scrutiny and, applying that standard, agreed with the pluralitythat the statute passed constitutional muster. Id., at 359-361.
Finally, in Lehr v. Robertson, 463 U. S. 248 (1983), this Courtupheld a New York law entitling all mothers of illegitimate children to prior notice of any adoption proceeding but entitling only

certain fathers to such notice. In holding that the statute didnot invidiously discriminate between the father and mother in
that case, we observed that the State could take account of thefact that the father had "never established any custodial, personal, or financial relationship with [his daughter]." Id., at 267.Viewed against these decisions, the lower court's choice of heightened scrutiny, particularly in this case, appears to be in error.Even if the Georgia Supreme Court correctly chose heightened
scrutiny, its application of that standard is equally dubious. Theonly authority cited by the Georgia Supreme Court for its apparent conclusion that $ 53-2-4(b)(2) was not substantially related toimportant governmental interests was a page from this Court's
decision in Miller v. Albright, 523 U. S. 420, 442 (1998). Thisreliance on Miller is misplaced for several reasons. Most notably,
the cited page does not even represent a holding of the Court butmerely the views of two Justices. Ibid. (opinion of Stevens, J.,
joined by Rehnquist, C. J.). There was no opinion for the Courtin Miller; rather six Justices, in three different opinions, affirmed
a lower court judgment rejecting a constitutional challenge to afederal statute that imposed certain proof-of-paternity requirements on children born abroad to alien mothers and citizen fathers(but not alien fathers and citizen mothers). See id., at 423-445;
id., at 445-452 (O'Connor, J., joined by Kennedy, J., concurringin judgment); id., at 452-459 (S

calia, J., joined by Thomas, J.,concurring in judgment). Moreover, the principal opinion cited

by the Georgia Supreme Court actually concluded that the statuteat issue was not based on impermissible stereotypes, id., at 442-
445, reasoning that "[t]he biological differences between singlemen and single women provide a relevant basis for differing rules
governing their ability to confer citizenship on children born inforeign lands," id., at 445. Thus, while the fractured decision
in Miller may demonstrate the need for additional guidance as tothe constitutionality of laws differentiating between fathers and
mothers of out-of-wedlock children, it does not stand for the prop-osition that all generalizations based on gender are constitutionally infirm.Further, I am at a loss to understand how the Georgia Supreme
Court's decision can be squared with this Court's decisions rec-ognizing women's unique role in childbirth. For example, this
Court invalidated a requirement that a woman seek her husband'sconsent before obtaining an abortion, reasoning that "[i]nasmuch

as it is the woman who physically bears the child and who is themore directly and immediately affected by the pregnancy, as between the two, the balance weighs in her favor." Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth, 428 U. S. 52, 71 (1976); see alsoPlanned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833,

896 (1992) ("It is an inescapable biological fact that state regula-tion with respect to the child a woman is carrying will have a
far greater impact on the mother's liberty than on the father's").The logic of the abortion cases, suggesting that the State may not
ignore a mother's unique efforts in carrying a child to term, flatlycontradicts the Georgia Supreme Court's reasoning that the State
must ignore these efforts when deciding whether she, as opposedto the father, is entitled to inherit from the deceased child's estate.

Apart from the apparent inconsistency between the decisionbelow and this Court's decisions, several prudential considerations counsel in favor of granting certiorari. This Court routinelyreviews state courts' decisions invalidating state or local laws on
federal constitutional grounds. See, e. g., Chicago v. Morales,ante, p. 41; Central State Univ. v. American Assn. of Univ. Professors, Central State Univ. Chapter, 526 U. S. 124 (1999) (per
curiam). Moreover, the State of Georgia has filed an amicusbrief urging the Court to uphold the constitutionality of $ 53-2-

4(b)(2), and its views should affect our decision whether to exer-cise jurisdiction. Finally, the importance of the issue cannot be
gainsaid. A variety of States have adopted similar legislationrequiring fathers (but not mothers) to support their children born
out of wedlock as a condition of inheriting from their estates.
See, e. g., Ala. Code $ 43-8-48(2) (1991); Del. Code Ann., Tit. 12,$ 508(2) (1995); Idaho Code $ 15-2-109(b) (1979); Ky. Rev. Stat.

Ann. $ 391.105(c)(2) (Michie Supp. 1998); Me. Rev. Stat. Ann.,Tit. 18-A, $ 2-109(2)(iii) (1998); Miss. Code Ann. $ 91-1-15(3)(d)(i)
(1994); Mo. Rev. Stat. $ 474.060.2 (1994); Neb. Rev. Stat. $ 30-
2309(2) (1995); S. C. Code Ann. $ 62-2-109(2) (Supp. 1998); Tenn.Code Ann. $ 31-2-105(a)(2)(B) (Supp. 1998); Va. Code Ann. $ 64.1-

5.1.3 (Supp. 1998). The decision of the Supreme Court of Georgia,resting on federal constitutional grounds, calls the continued validity of these statutes into doubt. In light of the issue's impor-tance and the substantial tension between the decision below and
this Court's decisions, I would vote to grant certiorari.

AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT OF 1990.

1. High blood pressure--Mitigating measures.--Determination whether
petitioner's impairment "substantially limits" one or more major life activities is made with reference to mitigating measures he employs; petitioner
is not "regarded as disabled" because of his high blood pressure. Murphy
v. United Parcel Service, Inc., p. 516.

2. Job qualifications--Employer's use of federal safety regulation--
Effect of waiver.--An employer requiring as a job qualification that an
employee meet a federal safety regulation--here, Department of Transportation's truckdriver vision standards--does not have to justify enforcing that regulation solely because it may be waived experimentally in an
individual case. Albertson's, Inc. v. Kirkingburg, p. 555.

3. Mentally disabled individuals--Placement in institutions.--Title II
of ADA requires States to place mentally disabled individuals in community settings rather than institutions when State's treatment professionals
determine that is appropriate, transfer is not opposed by affected individual, and placement can be reasonably accommodated, given State's resources and needs of others with mental disabilities. Olmstead v. L. C.,
p. 581.

4. Myopia--Mitigating measures.--Where corrective lenses allow severely myopic petitioners to function identically to individuals without a
similar impairment, they have failed to allege that they are "disabled"
within ADA's meaning. Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., p. 471.

APPEALS.

Final decision--Attorney sanctions.--An order imposing sanctions on
an attorney pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(a)(4) is not a
"final decision" under 28 U. S. C. $ 1291, even where attorney no longer
represents a party in case. Cunningham v. Hamilton County, p. 198.

Title VII action--Punitive damages.--An employer's conduct need not
be independently "egregious" to satisfy 42 U. S. C. $ 1981a(b)(1)'s requirements for a punitive damages award, although evidence of egregious
misconduct may be used to meet employee's burden to demonstrate that
employer acted with "malice" or "reckless indifference"; even assuming

that petitioner employee has met that burden, she must impute liability
for punitive damages to respondent. Kolstad v. American Dental Assn.,

CONSTITUTIONAL LAW.
I. Confrontation of Witnesses.

Admission of accomplice's confession--Harmless error.--Virginia Supreme Court's decision that Confrontation Clause was satisfied when confession of petitioner's accomplice, which incriminated petitioner in a capital murder, was introduced at petitioner's trial is reversed, and case is
remanded for a determination whether that error was harmless. Lilly v.
Virginia, p. 116.

II. Cruel and Unusual Punishment.

Death penalty--Jury instructions--Harmless error.--Eighth Amendment does not require that a jury be instructed as to the consequences of
jurors' failure to agree on a verdict; there was no reasonable likelihood
that jury here was led to believe that petitioner would receive a courtimposed sentence less than life imprisonment in event it could not recommend a sentence of death or life imprisonment without possibility of release; any error in allowing jury to consider aggravating factors that were
vague, overbroad, or duplicative in violation of Eighth Amendment was
harmless. Jones v. United States, p. 373.

III. Due Process.

1. Capital murder--Habeas corpus--Brady claim.--Although petitioner demonstrated cause for failing to raise in state court a claim under
Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83, Virginia did not violate Brady and its
progeny by failing to disclose exculpatory evidence to petitioner at his
capital murder trial. Strickler v. Greene, p. 263.

2. Gang Congregation Ordinance--Vagueness.--Illinois Supreme
Court's holding that Chicago ordinance prohibiting "criminal street gang
members" from loitering in public places is unconstitutionally vague is
affirmed. Chicago v. Morales, p. 41.

IV. Freedom of Speech.

Commercial speech--Casino advertisements.--Title 18 U. S. C. $ 1304,
which prohibits broadcasters from carrying advertising about privately
operated commercial casino gambling, may not be applied to petitioners'
broadcast of such advertisements in Louisiana, where private casino gambling is legal. Greater New Orleans Broadcasting Assn., Inc. v. United
States, p. 173.

V. Right to Jury Trial.

VI. Searches and Seizures.

Warrant requirement--Automobile exception.--Automobile exception
to Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement does not require a separate
finding of exigency in addition to a probable-cause finding. Maryland v.
Dyson, p. 465.

VII. States' Immunity from Suit.

1. Abrogation by patent law.--Patent and Plant Variety Protection
Remedy Clarification Act's abrogation of States' sovereign immunity cannot be sustained as legislation enacted to enforce guarantees of Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd. v. College Savings Bank, p. 627.

2. Abrogation by trademark law--Voluntary waiver of immunity.--
Federal courts have no jurisdiction over a suit under Trademark Act of
1946 (Lanham Act) against Florida Prepaid because Florida's sovereign
immunity was neither validly abrogated by Trademark Remedy Clarification Act nor voluntarily waived by State's activities in interstate
commerce. College Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed.
Expense Bd., p. 666.

3. Private damages suits in state court--Waiver of immunity.--Congress' Article I powers do not include power to subject nonconsenting
States to private suits for damages in state courts; Maine did not waive
its sovereign immunity with regard to state-court actions filed under Fair
Labor Standards Act of 1938. Alden v. Maine, p. 706.
