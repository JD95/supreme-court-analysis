UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtacquittal filed one day outside the time limit prescribed byFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29(c).IPetitioner Charles Carlisle, along with several co-defendants, was tried by jury in the United States DistrictCourt for the Western District of Michigan for conspiracy topossess with intent to distribute marijuana, in violation of21 U. S. C. $$ 841, 846, 84 Stat. 1260, 1265. He did not moveduring the trial for a judgment of acquittal under FederalRule of Criminal Procedure 29(a). On July 13, 1993, the juryreturned a guilty verdict and was discharged. On July 23,1993, Carlisle filed a "Motion for a Judgment of AcquittalPursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29(c)," arguing that there was insufficient evidence to sustain his con-viction. App. 6-9. Rule 29(c) provides that "a motion forjudgment of acquittal may be made or renewed within 7 daysafter the jury is discharged or within such further time asthe court may fix during the 7-day period." Excluding theintermediate Saturday and Sunday (as Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 45(a) requires), the 7-day period in this caseended on July 22, 1993. The United States' response to Carlisle's motion argued that it should be denied as untimelyand, alternatively, that there was sufficient evidence to sustain the conviction. The District Court denied Carlisle'smotion on August 19, 1993. Its written opinion did not address the timeliness issue, but concluded that the evidencewas sufficient for a rational trier of fact to find beyond areasonable doubt that Carlisle knew about, and knowinglyand voluntarily joined, the charged conspiracy.When Carlisle appeared for sentencing on October 14,1993, the District Court announced that it was reversing itsruling. When it made its decision in August, the court said,it had prepared two opinions, one granting and one denyingthe motion, and it had now decided to substitute the formerfor the latter. The court subsequently entered an order that517US2$47K 02-07-99 17:26:51 PAGES OPINPGT419Cite as: 517 U.

App.45. An opinion accompanying the order concluded thatthere was insufficient evidence to prove that Carlisle know-ingly and voluntarily joined the conspiracy to possess anddistribute marijuana. In a footnote, the opinion acknowl-edged that the motion for judgment of acquittal was filed oneday late, but concluded:". . . I can conceive of no prejudice to the UnitedStates which will result from consideration of a motionthat is one day lat[e] in this case. Because I believethat refusal to hear this motion would result in graveinjustice, and because [Rule 29(c)] permits the Court toextend the deadline, I will consider this motion as if itwere filed in a timely manner." Id., at 37.The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuitreversed the judgment of acquittal and remanded to the District Court for reinstatement of the jury's verdict and forsentencing. It held that under Rule 29 a district court hasno jurisdiction to grant an untimely motion for judgment ofacquittal, and that a district court has no jurisdiction to entera judgment of acquittal sua sponte after the case has beensubmitted to the jury. 48 F. 3d 190, 192 (1995).

UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtRule 29 is reproduced in its entirety below.1 Subdivision(c) provides, in relevant part, that "[i]f the jury returns averdict of guilty . . . , a motion for judgment of acquittal may1 "Rule 29. Motion for Judgment of Acquittal"(a) Motion Before Submission to Jury. Motions for directed verdict are abolished and motions for judgment of acquittal shall be used intheir place. The court on motion of a defendant or of its own motion shallorder the entry of judgment of acquittal of one or more offenses chargedin the indictment or information after the evidence on either side is closedif the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction of such offense oroffenses. If a defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal at the close ofthe evidence offered by the government is not granted, the defendant mayoffer evidence without having reserved the right."(b) Reservation of Decision on Motion. The court may reservedecision on a motion for judgment of acquittal, proceed with the trial(where the motion is made before the close of all the evidence), submit thecase to the jury and decide the motion either before the jury returns averdict or after it returns a verdict of guilty or is discharged withouthaving returned a verdict. If the court reserves decision, it must decidethe motion on the basis of the evidence at the time the ruling wasreserved."(c) Motion after Discharge of Jury. If the jury returns a verdictof guilty or is discharged without having returned a verdict, a motion forjudgment of acquittal may be made or renewed within 7 days after thejury is discharged or within such further time as the court may fix duringthe 7-day period. If a verdict of guilty is returned the court may on suchmotion set aside the verdict and enter judgment of acquittal. If no verdict is returned the court may enter judgment of acquittal. It shall notbe necessary to the making of such a motion that a similar motion hasbeen made prior to the submission of the case to the jury."(d) Same: Conditional Ruling on Grant of Motion. If a motionfor judgment of acquittal after verdict of guilty under this Rule is granted,the court shall also determine whether any motion for a new trial shouldbe granted if the judgment of acquittal is thereafter vacated or reversed,specifying the grounds for such determination. If the motion for a newtrial is granted conditionally, the order thereon does not affect the finalityof the judgment. If the motion for a new trial has been granted conditionally and the judgment is reversed on appeal, the new trial shall proceedunless the appellate court has otherwise ordered. If such motion hasbeen denied conditionally, the appellee on appeal may assert error in thatdenial, and if the judgment is reversed on appeal, subsequent proceedingsshall be in accordance with the order of the appellate court."517US2$47K 02-07-99 17:26:51 PAGES OPINPGT421Cite as: 517 U. S. 416 (1996)Opinion of the Courtbe made or renewed within 7 days after the jury is discharged or within such further time as the court may fixduring the 7-day period." Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 45(b) provides that whereas certain untimely acts maybe accorded validity upon a showing of excusable neglect,"the court may not extend the time for taking any actionunder Rul[e] 29 . . . except to the extent and under the conditions stated in [the Rule]." These Rules are plain and unambiguous. If, as in this case, a guilty verdict is returned,a motion for judgment of acquittal must be filed, eitherwithin seven days of the jury's discharge, or within an extended period fixed by the court during that 7-day period.There is simply no room in the text of Rules 29 and 45(b) forthe granting of an untimely postverdict motion for judgmentof acquittal, regardless of whether the motion is accompaniedby a claim of legal innocence, is filed before sentencing, orwas filed late because of attorney error.Unable to offer any reading of Rule 29(c) that wouldpermit an untimely motion for judgment of acquittal to begranted, Carlisle contends that Rule 29(a) gives a districtcourt authority to enter a judgment of acquittal sua sponteat any time before sentencing. Rule 29(a), entitled "MotionBefore Submission to Jury," provides in relevant part:"The court on motion of a defendant or of its own motionshall order the entry of judgment of acquittal of one ormore offenses charged in the indictment or informationafter the evidence on either side is closed if the evidenceis insufficient to sustain a conviction of such offense oroffenses."It would be quite a surprise to find a district court's suasponte power to grant judgment of acquittal after submission of the case to the jury hidden away in a provision entitled "Motion Before Submission to Jury." We are not inclined to adopt an interpretation that creates such a surpriseunless the intent that the text exceed its caption is clear.517US2$47K 02-07-99 17:26:51 PAGES OPINPGT422 CARLISLE v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtHere, to the contrary, the structure of Rule 29 indicates thatsubdivision (a) is limited as its caption says.Petitioner's proposed reading would create an odd systemin which defense counsel could move for judgment of acquittal for only seven days after the jury's discharge, but thecourt's power to enter such a judgment would linger. InUnited States v. Smith, 331 U. S. 469 (1947), we declined toread former Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33, whichplaced a 5-day limit on the making of a motion for new trial,as "permit[ting] the judge to order retrial without requestand at any time," 331 U. S., at 473. "[I]t would be a strangerule," we said, "which deprived a judge of power to do whatwas asked when request was made by the person most concerned, and yet allowed him to act without petition," andsuch an arrangement "would almost certainly subject trialjudges to private appeals or application by counsel or friendsof one convicted," id., at 474, 475. The same is true here.2In addition, petitioner's reading makes a farce of subdivision(b) of Rule 29, which provides that a court may reserve decision on the motion for judgment of acquittal and decide itafter submission to the jury. There would be no need forthis procedure if, even without reserving, the court had continuing power to grant judgment of acquittal on its own. In2 The dissent forcefully argues that Smith does not compel the result wereach in this case. Post, at 452-453. That is an effective rejoinder to anargument we have not made. In response to the argument we havemade--that some of the considerations supporting the holding in Smithapply here--the dissent (i) ignores the portion of Smith discussing thestrangeness of a rule that would give a judge greater power to act suasponte than on motion; and (ii) transforms Smith's desire to spare trialjudges "private appeals or application by counsel or friends of the personconvicted" into a concern for the "appearance of impropriety" that "exparte approaches" would create, post, at 453, which concern in the presentcontext (though presumably for some reason not in the Smith context) thedissent regards as "a highly inappropriate comment on the integrity ofthe federal judiciary," ibid., and the dissent says it was dictum in Smithanyway.517US2$47K 02-07-99 17:26:51 PAGES OPINPGT423Cite as: 517 U. S. 416 (1996)Opinion of the Courtsum, even without the captions (and a fortiori with them) itis clear that subdivisions (a) and (b) of Rule 29 pertain tomotions made before submission, and subdivisions (c) and (d)to motions made after discharge.The Government offers an alternative theory of a court'spower to act sua sponte under Rule 29: Because Rule 29(a)refers to both a "motion of a defendant" and a court's "ownmotion," whereas Rule 29(c) refers only to "a motion" simpliciter, the latter must refer to motions both of defendants andof courts, permitting both such "motions" to be made withinseven days after the jury's discharge. We do not find thisreading plausible. Rule 29(c) not only provides that "a motion for judgment of acquittal" may be made or renewedwithin seven days after the jury is discharged. It goes onto provide, in its second and third sentences: "If a verdict ofguilty is returned the court may on such motion set asidethe verdict and enter judgment of acquittal. If no verdict isreturned the court may enter judgment of acquittal." Thephrase "on such motion" is notably absent from the thirdsentence--conveying the idea that, where a jury has not returned a verdict, a court can act without motion, but wherea jury has returned a guilty verdict, it cannot. But if "onsuch motion" includes action taken by a court on its owninitiative, the limiting phrase "on such motion" in the secondsentence has no effect, and a court may act on its ownwhether or not a verdict has been returned. That is to say,the inclusion of the phrase "on such motion" in one sentencebut not in the other would be inexplicable.33 Perhaps even more inexplicable is what precisely would be achievedby the Government's reading, which (unlike petitioner's theories) wouldpermit the court to act sua sponte only during the 7-day period specifiedby the Rule (or any extension thereof ordered by the court during the7-day period, as Rule 29(c) allows). The sole beneficiary of the Government's textual contortions is the district judge who wants to set aside averdict, but lacks the wit to invite a motion for that during the 7-dayperiod, or (if defendant's counsel is unavailable) to extend the 7-day period,517US2$47K 02-07-99 17:26:51 PAGES OPINPGT424 CARLISLE v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtPetitioner contends that even if Rule 29 does not permit acourt to grant an untimely motion for judgment of acquittal,Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 2 vests the court withsupervisory power to enter judgment of acquittal. Rule 2provides:"These rules are intended to provide for the just deter-mination of every criminal proceeding. They shall beconstrued to secure simplicity in procedure, fairnessin administration and the elimination of unjustifiableexpense and delay."This Rule is of no aid to petitioner. It sets forth a principleof interpretation to be used in construing ambiguous rules,not a principle of law superseding clear rules that do notachieve the stated objectives. It does not, that is to say,provide that rules shall be construed to mean somethingother than what they plainly say--which is what petitioner'sproposed construction of Rule 29(c) would require.We must acknowledge that there is precedent in this Courtfor using Rule 2 as a basis for deviating from time limitsimposed by the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. InFallen v. United States, 378 U. S. 139 (1964), we cited Rule2 in the course of excusing the failure of an incarceratedparaplegic pro se petitioner to comply with the time limitfor filing a notice of appeal under former Federal Rule ofCriminal Procedure 37(a). Concluding that the petitioner"had done all that could reasonably be expected" to file atimely appeal, including mailing a notice of appeal to theclerk's office two days before the notice was due, we "decline[d] to read the Rules so rigidly as to bar a determinationof his appeal on the merits." 378 U. S., at 144.Fallen hasbeen made obsolete by an amendment to Rule 37(a).4 Andsua sponte, in order to invite such a motion later. It is our hope andbelief that no such district judge exists.4 Rule 37(a) was amended in 1966 to provide that a district court mayextend the time for filing a notice of appeal "[u]pon a showing of excusable517US2$47K 02-07-99 17:26:51 PAGES OPINPGT425Cite as: 517 U. S. 416 (1996)Opinion of the Courtof course Fallen was a narrow ruling when it was announced,as is evident fromBerman v. United States, 378 U. S. 530(1964) (per curiam), a decision announced on the same dayasFallen, summarily affirming the dismissal of an appealthat had been filed one day late.Finally, petitioner cannot rely on Federal Rule of CriminalProcedure 57 as the source of the District Court's authorityin this case. The version of Rule 57 in effect when criminalproceedings against petitioner commenced (and which he relied upon at oral argument) states, in relevant part, that,"[i]n all cases not provided for by rule, the district judges. . . may regulate their practice in any manner not inconsist-ent with these rules." The relevant portion of the currentversion of Rule 57 is captioned "Procedure When There IsNo Controlling Law," and states: "A judge may regulatepractice in any manner consistent with federal law, theserules, and local rules of the district." Fed. Rule Crim. Proc.57(b). We need not decide which version of this Rule controls the present case, because neither authorizes the District Court's action here. A rule permitting a party to submit and prevail on an untimely motion for judgment ofacquittal is "inconsistent" (or not "consistent") with Rule 29's7-day filing limit; and the question of when a motion for judgment of acquittal may be granted does not present a case"not provided for" by Rule 29; and Rule 29 is the "controllinglaw" governing this question.IIIAs alternative authority for the District Court's action,petitioner invokes courts' "inherent supervisory power."Brief for Petitioner 9. We have recognized that federalneglect." See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 37(a) (1966). When Rule 37(a) wasabrogated and replaced by Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(b), thesubstance of this amendment was transferred to Rule 4(b). See Fed. RuleApp. Proc. 4(b) (1968).517US2$47K 02-07-99 17:26:51 PAGES OPINPGT426 CARLISLE v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtcourts "may, within limits, formulate procedural rules notspecifically required by the Constitution or the Congress."United States v. Hasting, 461 U. S. 499, 505 (1983). Whatever the scope of this "inherent power," however, it does notinclude the power to develop rules that circumvent or conflictwith the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. As we recognized in Bank of Nova Scotia v. United States, 487 U. S.250, 254-255 (1988), holding that federal courts may not invoke supervisory power to circumvent Rule 52(a): "[F]ederalcourts have no more discretion to disregard the Rule's mandate than they do to disregard constitutional or statutoryprovisions." Whether the action of the District Court hereis described as the granting of an untimely motion, or thesua sponte entry of a judgment of acquittal, it contradictedthe plain language of Rule 29(c), and effectively annulled the7-day filing limit.In Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U. S. 32, 47 (1991), wesaid that we would not " `lightly assume that Congress hasintended to depart from established principles' such as thescope of a court's inherent power," id., at 47 (quoting Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo, 456 U. S. 305, 313 (1982)). Similarly, in Link v. Wabash R. Co., 370 U. S. 626, 629-632 (1962),we said that since a district court's authority to dismiss suasponte for lack of prosecution was a "sanction of wide usage,"we would not assume, in the absence of a clear expression,that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(b), which allowed aparty to move for dismissal for lack of prosecution, abrogatedthis "long . . . unquestioned" power. That cautionary principle does not apply in the present case, not only because ofthe clarity of the text, but also because we are unaware ofany "long unquestioned" power of federal district courts toacquit for insufficient evidence sua sponte, after return of aguilty verdict. Indeed, we are aware of only two cases priorto the enactment of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedurethat could be read as asserting in dictum the existence of517US2$47K 02-07-99 17:26:51 PAGES OPINPGT427Cite as: 517 U. S. 416 (1996)Opinion of the Courtsuch a power. United States v. McCracken, 26 F. Cas. 1069,1069 (No. 15,664) (ED Va. 1878); United States v. Hayden, 26F. Cas. 236, 238 (No. 15,333) (NDNY 1877).55 The dissent's extended discussion of pre-Rule federal cases produces alot of smoke, and no fire. Ansley v. United States, 135 F. 2d 207, 208 (CA51943), described by the dissent as "establishing a district court's inherentpower to review sua sponte a jury verdict for sufficiency of the evidence,"post, at 446, establishes no such thing. There, after noting the appellants'failure to renew their motions for directed verdict at the close of evidence,the Fifth Circuit said:"[T]he question of the sufficiency of the evidence was not properly savedfor review by this court. It is true that the question may and should beraised by the court of its own motion, if necessary to prevent a miscarriageof justice, but this is not such a case. We have examined the record, andhave found it to contain ample evidence to support the judgment." 135F. 2d, at 208.It is obvious that the statement "the question may and should be raisedby the court of its own motion" refers to the power of an appellate courtto review sufficiency of the evidence where the issue has not been preserved for appeal. The cases cited by the dissent deal with the power ofa district court to enter a judgment of acquittal before the return of averdict (i. e., to direct a verdict of acquittal), see Cady v. United States,293 F. 829 (CADC 1923); Nosowitz v. United States, 282 F. 575, 578 (CA21922); United States v. Fullerton, 25 F. Cas. 1225 (No. 15,176) (SDNY1870); the power of a district court to set aside a verdict and order a newtrial, see Wiborg v. United States, 163 U. S. 632, 658-659 (1896); UnitedStates v. Harding, 26 F. Cas. 131, 136 (No. 15,301) (ED Pa. 1846); cf.Charles v. State, 4 Port. 107, 109-110 (Ala. 1836); the power of a districtcourt to enter judgment of acquittal where the defendant has made apreverdict or postverdict motion to acquit, see Ex parte United States,101 F. 2d 870, 878 (CA7 1939), aff'd by an equally divided Court, UnitedStates v. Stone, 308 U. S. 519 (1939); United States v. Standard Oil Co., 23F. Supp. 937, 938-939 (WD Wis. 1938); cf. State v. Meen, 171 Wis. 36, 38-39(1920); and even the power of an appellate court to reverse a districtcourt's denial of a motion for directed verdict, see Nosowitz, supra, at 578;Cherry v. United States, 78 F. 2d 334 (CA7 1935); Reiner v. United States,92 F. 2d 823, 824-825 (CA9 1937); France v. United States, 164 U. S. 676,680 (1897); Romano v. United States, 9 F. 2d 522, 524 (CA2 1925). Not asingle pre-Rule case cited by the dissent purports to exercise the powerat issue here: a district court's power to enter judgment of acquittal forinsufficient evidence, without motion, and after the return of a guilty517US2$47K 02-07-99 17:26:51 PAGES OPINPGT428 CARLISLE v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtThe case law of this Court that petitioner relies upon doesnot establish any "inherent power" to act in contraventionof applicable Rules. In Gaca v. United States, 411 U. S. 618(1973) (per curiam), which reinstated an appeal that hadbeen dismissed for want of timely prosecution, there was nosuggestion that reinstatement was contrary to any statuteor rule of procedure. And in United States v. Nobles, 422U. S. 225 (1975), which approved exercise of a DistrictCourt's inherent authority to order the disclosure of certainwitness statements, we felt it necessary to make sure thatsuch exercise did not conflict with Federal Rule of CriminalProcedure 16. Petitioner's best case isThompson v. INS,375 U. S. 384 (1964), which, contrary to former Federal Ruleof Civil Procedure 73(a), gave effect to a notice of appeal filedmore than 60 days from the entry of judgment.Thompson,however, is not pertinent here, since it expressly relied uponthe " `unique circumstances' " that the cause of the failure tomeet the Rule's deadline was an erroneous ruling or assurance by the District Court itself. 375 U. S., at 387 (quotingHarris Truck Lines, Inc. v. Cherry Meat Packers, Inc., 371U. S. 215, 217 (1962) (per curiam)).IVPetitioner's three remaining arguments need not detain uslong. First, he argues that the District Court had power toenter a judgment of acquittal in this case under the All WritsAct, 28 U. S. C. $ 1651, through the writ ofcoram nobis.Apart from the fact that the District Court was not asked toverdict. The dissent apparently thinks it an adequate explanation for thislack of support that, prior to our decision in United States v. Smith, 331U. S. 469, 474 (1947) (suggesting that sua sponte grant of a new trial mayraise double jeopardy concerns), district courts could order new trialswhere there was insufficient evidence to sustain the jury verdict. Post,at 442-443. But if these district courts truly had latent inherent powerto enter a judgment of acquittal, surely at least some of them would havebeen willing to give a legally innocent defendant that to which he wasentitled--viz., a judgment of acquittal--rather than just a new trial.517US2$47K 02-07-99 17:26:51 PAGES OPINPGT429Cite as: 517 U. S. 416 (1996)Opinion of the Courtissue, and did not purport to be issuing, a writ of coramnobis, that writ would not have lain here, since it was traditionally available only to bring before the court factualerrors "material to the validity and regularity of the legalproceeding itself," such as the defendant's being under ageor having died before the verdict. See United States v.Mayer, 235 U. S. 55, 67-68 (1914). Moreover, "[t]he AllWrits Act is a residual source of authority to issue writsthat are not otherwise covered by statute. Where a statutespecifically addresses the particular issue at hand, it is thatauthority, and not the All Writs Act, that is controlling."Pennsylvania Bureau of Correction v. United States Marshals Service, 474 U. S. 34, 43 (1985). As we noted a fewyears after enactment of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, "it is difficult to conceive of a situation in a federalcriminal case today where [a writ of coram nobis] would benecessary or appropriate." United States v. Smith, 331U. S., at 475, n. 4. In the present case, Rule 29 provides theapplicable law.Second, petitioner asserts that the failure to allow the District Court to enter a judgment of acquittal would violatethe Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. His argument on this point consists of nothing more than bald assertions that Rule 29(c) as applied to the facts of this casetransgresses principles of fundamental fairness, "shocks theconscience," and interferes with rights "implicit in the concept of ordered liberty." Brief for Petitioner 28-29 (internal quotation marks omitted) (citing Herrera v. Collins, 506U. S. 390 (1993); Rochin v. California, 342 U. S. 165, 172(1952); Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U. S. 319, 325-326 (1937)).Petitioner has failed to proffer any historical, textual, or controlling precedential support for his argument that the inability of a district court to grant an untimely postverdictmotion for judgment of acquittal violates the Fifth Amendment, and we decline to fashion a new due process right outof thin air.517US2$47K 02-07-99 17:26:51 PAGES OPINPGT430 CARLISLE v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtThird, petitioner argues that prohibiting a district courtfrom granting a motion for judgment of acquittal filed oneday late will lead to needless appeals and habeas corpus pro-ceedings, where it will be more difficult for defendants toobtain relief than in motions directed to the trial court. As-suming,arguendo, that these contentions are accurate, wecannot permit them to alter our analysis, for we are not atliberty to ignore the mandate of Rule 29 in order to obtain"optimal" policy results. Cf. United States v. Robinson, 361U. S. 220, 229-230 (1960). We are similarly unmoved bypetitioner's contention that the "rationale" behind Rule29(c)'s time limit does not apply where the motion for judg-ment of acquittal is filed a mere eight days after the trial.The only evident "rationale" behind Rule 29(c)'s 7-day timelimit is that a motion for judgment of acquittal filed eightdays after trial is a motion filed one day later than justiceand equity demand. As we said in a case involving the filingdeadline of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of1976, 43 U. S. C. $ 1744 (1988 ed.): "If 1-day late filings areacceptable, 10-day late filings might be equally acceptable,and so on in a cascade of exceptions that would engulf therule erected by the filing deadline; yet regardless of wherethe cutoff line is set, some individuals will always fall juston the other side of it." United States v. Locke, 471 U. S.84, 101 (1985).VFinally, we may respond to some of the many argumentsput forward by the dissent. The dissent makes the sweeping assertion that "a district court clearly has the inherentauthority to ensure that a legally innocent defendant is notwrongfully convicted," post, at 442. Perhaps so. As thedissent itself recognizes, however, that power has come to anend once an appeal has been taken. Post, at 452-453. Weare in accord, then, that there is some point at which thedistrict court is rendered powerless to enter a judgment ofacquittal, and the disagreement between us and the dissent517US2$47K 02-07-99 17:26:51 PAGES OPINPGT431Cite as: 517 U. S. 416 (1996)Opinion of the Courtcomes down to nothing more cosmic than the question of tim-ing--which we find answered by the text of Rule 29.In an effort to explain why, if a Rule 29(c) motion is inany event unnecessary, it makes any sense to impose a 7-daydeadline upon the making of it, the dissent maintains thatthe untimeliness of a motion gives a district court discretionto ignore it.Post, at 445. This presents the disedifyingprospect of a court vested with "the inherent authority toensure that a legally innocent defendant is not wrongfullyconvicted," post, at 442, exercising its discretion to let aninnocent defendant be wrongfully convicted. Quite obviously, this explanation of the deadline is incompatible withthe premise that underlies the dissent's entire argument.As for the dissent's concern, post, at 448, that our decisionruns afoul of Rule 2's mandate that the rules "be construedto secure simplicity in procedure, fairness in administrationand the elimination of unjustifiable expense and delay": Wesee neither simplicity, nor fairness, nor elimination of delayin a regime that makes it discretionary whether an untimelymotion for judgment of acquittal will be entertained.The dissent asserts that "permissive rules do not withdraw pre-existing inherent powers." Post, at 452. That assertion is really not relevant to the present case since, as wehave discussed, the power to enter postverdict judgmentsof acquittal sua sponte was not a "pre-existing inherentpower." See supra, at 426-428, and n. 5. But besides thelack of factual predicate for its application here, the principlethe dissent proposes would produce some extraordinary consequences. For example, as the cases cited by the dissentillustrate, see post, at 439-440, courts previously have ordered new trials sua sponte. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33, however, provides that "[t]he court on motion ofa defendant may grant a new trial . . . ." Following thedissent's logic, Rule 33, being permissive, does not precludea court from granting a new trial without motion, therebyleaving open to the court a course of action that may well517US2$47K 02-07-99 17:26:51 PAGES OPINPGT432 CARLISLE v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtviolate the Double Jeopardy Clause. But see AdvisoryCommittee's Notes on 1966 Amendment of Fed. Rule Crim.Proc. 33, 18 U. S. C. App., p. 801 ("The amendments to thefirst two sentences make it clear that a judge has no powerto order a new trial on his own motion, that he can act onlyin response to a motion timely made by a defendant. Problems of double jeopardy arise when the court acts on its ownmotion"). Similarly, a pre-existing practice, if there wasone, would allow a subpoena to be served by a party or aminor despite Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 17(d) ("Asubpoena may be served by the marshal, by a deputy marshal or by any other person who is not a party and who isnot less than 18 years of age"); would allow a judge fromanother district to take over a jury trial from a disabledjudge despite Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 25(a) ("If. . . the judge before whom a jury trial has commenced isunable to proceed with the trial, any other judge regularlysitting in or assigned to the court . . . may proceed with andfinish the trial"); and would allow a court to correct a technicalerror in a sentence more than seven days after the imposition of the sentence, despite Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(c) ("The court, acting within 7 days after the imposition of sentence, may correct a sentence that was imposedas a result of arithmetical, technical, or other clear error").The decisions of Justice Harlan relied upon by the dissentto support the proposition that permissive rules do not eliminate inherent powers are not germane. We have discussedLink above, see supra, at 426. In United States v. OhioPower Co., 353 U. S. 98, 104 (1957), Justice Harlan noted thatthis Court has proceeded on the assumption that we haveinherent authority to "affect judgments by action whichwould otherwise be out of time under [our own] Rules."That statement would be relevant if the present case involved a district court's departure from one of its ownrules--which of course it does not. In Fernandez v. United517US2$47K 02-07-99 17:26:51 PAGES OPINPGT433Cite as: 517 U. S. 416 (1996)Opinion of the CourtStates, 81 S. Ct. 642 (1961), 5 L. Ed. 2d 683 (Harlan, J., inchambers), Justice Harlan recognized that the provision offormer Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 46(a) that a "per-son arrested for an offense not punishable by death shall beadmitted to bail" (emphasis added) did not withdraw districtcourts' authority torevoke bail in a noncapital case. Fer-nandez, supra, at 644, and n. 7, 5 L. Ed. 2d, at 685, and n. 7.What admitting to bail implies with respect to revocation ofbail is not comparable to what granting judgment on motionimplies with respect to granting judgment without motion.What the dissent needs, in the Fernandez context, is a caseholding that a statute which permits bail for "persons ar-rested for noncapital offenses" does not preclude bail for persons arrested for capital offenses. Of course, such a casewill not be found.Finally, the dissent contends that United States v. Sisson,399 U. S. 267 (1970), supports existence of the "inherentpower" petitioner invokes. See post, at 448-449. We thinknot.Sisson did not "implicitly conclude" that it was properto enter a postverdict judgment of acquittal without motion,because the propriety of the judgment of acquittal was irrel-evant to the decision. The only issue was whether the judgment appealed from was a judgment of acquittal (proper orimproper), because that would mean that the Government'sappeal under the former 18 U. S. C. $ 3731 (which did notapply to judgments of acquittal) must be dismissed. SeeUnited States v. Wilson, 420 U. S. 332, 351 (1975) (appeal inSisson "was barred solely by the statute").* * *We conclude that the District Court had no authority togrant petitioner's motion for judgment of acquittal filed oneday outside the time limit prescribed by Rule 29(c). Wetherefore affirm the judgment of the Sixth Circuit.
