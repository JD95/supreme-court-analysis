In Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U. S. 511 (1985), we held that adistrict court's rejection of a defendant's qualified-immunitydefense is a "final decision" subject to immediate appealunder the general appellate jurisdiction statute, 28 U. S. C.$ 1291. The question presented in this case is whether adefendant's immediate appeal of an unfavorable qualifiedimmunity ruling on his motion to dismiss deprives the courtof appeals of jurisdiction over a second appeal, also basedon qualified immunity, immediately following denial of sum-mary judgment.IIn 1983, South Coast Savings and Loan Association, a newinstitution, applied to the Federal Home Loan Bank Board(FHLBB or Board) for the approval necessary to obtain ac-count insurance from the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC).1 Under FHLBB regulations,approval of new institutions was to be withheld if their "financial policies or management" were found to be "unsafe"for any of various reasons, including "character of the management." 12 CFR $ 571.6(b) (1986). Accordingly, whenFHLBB approved South Coast for FSLIC insurance inMarch 1984, it imposed a number of requirements, includingthe condition that South Coast "provide for employment ofa qualified full-time executive managing officer, subject toapproval by the Principal Supervisory Agent"--FHLBB'sterm for the president of the regional Home Loan Bank whenoperating in his oversight capacity on behalf of FHLBB.Record, Exh. B, Resolution No. 84-164, || 10(p) (Mar. 29,1984). The Board's resolution also required that, for aperiod of three years, any change in South Coast's chiefmanagement position be approved by FHLBB.Ibid.1 FHLBB, FSLIC, and the regulatory scheme described in this opinionno longer exist, having been eliminated by the Financial InstitutionsReform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989, 103 Stat. 183.516us2$22k 10-22-98 12:37:53 PAGES OPINPGT302 BEHRENS v. PELLETIEROpinion of the CourtShortly after obtaining FHLBB's conditional approval,South Coast was succeeded in interest by Pioneer Savingsand Loan Association, another new institution. Pioneernamed respondent Pelletier as its managing officer, subjectto FHLBB consent, which Pioneer sought in mid-May 1985.Only a few weeks earlier, however, on April 23, 1985,FHLBB had declared insolvent Beverly Hills Savings andLoan Association, where respondent had at one time held asenior executive position. An inquiry by FSLIC pointedto potential misconduct by high-level management of thefailed institution, which ultimately became the subject ofan FSLIC lawsuit against several Beverly Hills officers, including respondent.The FSLIC suit had not yet been filed at the time Pioneersought the Board's consent to hire respondent; but FSLIC'spending investigation into Beverly Hills' collapse causedpetitioner Behrens, the FHLBB "Supervisory Agent" thenresponsible for monitoring Pioneer's operations, to write Pioneer on May 8, 1986, withholding approval and advising thatrespondent be replaced. On receipt of the letter Pioneerasked respondent to resign and, when he refused, fired him.Three years later, in 1989, respondent brought suit in federal court, naming petitioner as defendant in a complaintthat included Bivens damages claims for two alleged constitutional wrongs. See Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388 (1971). Respondent charged, first,that petitioner's action in writing a letter that had effectivelydischarged him from his post at Pioneer, in summary fashionand without notice or opportunity to be heard, violated hisright to procedural due process. Second, he claimed that hehad been deprived of substantive due process by petitioner'salleged interference with his "clearly established and Constitutionally protected property and liberty rights . . . to specific employment and to pursue his profession free fromundue governmental interference." First Amended Complaint || 38, reprinted in App. 7, 16. The complaint alleged516us2$22k 10-22-98 12:37:53 PAGES OPINPGT303Cite as: 516 U. S. 299 (1996)Opinion of the Courtthat petitioner's letter, along with other, continuing effortsto harm respondent's reputation, had cost respondent notonly his position at Pioneer, but also his livelihood withinthe savings and loan industry. The complaint also containedother claims--against petitioner and against the FederalHome Loan Bank of San Francisco (petitioner's immediateemployer), FHLBB, and the United States; none of these isrelevant to the present appeal.Petitioner filed a motion to dismiss or, in the alternative,for summary judgment. With regard to the Bivens claims,he asserted a statute-of-limitations defense and claimedqualified immunity from suit on the ground that his actions,taken in a governmental capacity, "d[id] not violate clearlyestablished statutory or constitutional rights." Harlow v.Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800, 818 (1982). The District Courtruled in favor of petitioner on the statute-of-limitationsground and therefore dismissed the procedural due processBivens claim, and the substantive due process Bivens claimto the extent it related to petitioner's letter and respondent'sloss of employment at Pioneer. It refused, however, to dismiss respondent's suit "to the extent [it was] based on otheralleged subsequent acts of defendan[t] preventing and continuing to prevent [respondent] from securing employment."Pelletier v. Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco, No.CV 89-969 (CD Cal., Oct. 5, 1989), reprinted in App. 27-28.The court also denied petitioner's summary judgment motion, without prejudice, on the ground that it was prematuregiven the lack of discovery.Petitioner immediately appealed the District Court's implicit denial of his qualified-immunity defense regarding theremaining Bivens claim. The Court of Appeals entertainedthe appeal, notwithstanding its interlocutory nature, holdingthat "a denial of qualified immunity is an appealable `final'order under the test set forth in Cohen v. Beneficial Indust.Loan Corp., 337 U. S. 541 (1949) . . . , regardless of whetherthat denial takes the form of a refusal to grant a defendant's516us2$22k 10-22-98 12:37:53 PAGES OPINPGT304 BEHRENS v. PELLETIEROpinion of the Courtmotion to dismiss or a denial of summary judgment." Pelletier v. Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco, 968 F. 2d865, 870 (CA9 1992). It said in dictum, however, that a de-fendant claiming qualified immunity could not "take advantage of the several opportunities for immediate appeal afforded him by bringing repeated pretrial appeals," and that"[o]ne such interlocutory appeal is all that a government official is entitled to and all that we will entertain." Id., at870-871. On the merits of the appeal, the court rejectedthe argument that petitioner enjoyed qualified immunity be-cause he had not violated any "clearly established right." Itsaid that the question whether respondent had a constitutionally protected property interest in his Pioneer employment (subject, as it was, to regulatory approval) was notproperly before the court, since the claims relating specifically to his discharge had been dismissed as time barred.Id., at 871-872. (The Court of Appeals noted in dictum,however, id., at 869, n. 6, that the District Court had appliedan unduly short limitations period.) With respect to theclaimed deprivation of post-Pioneer employment, the courtheld that the "nebulous theories of conspiracy" set out inrespondent's complaint--although "insufficient to survive amotion for summary judgment"--made out a proper Bivensclaim. 968 F. 2d, at 872-873.Upon remand, the District Court reversed its earlierstatute-of-limitations ruling in light of the Court of Appeals'dictum, and reinstated the claims relating to employment atPioneer. After discovery, petitioner moved for summaryjudgment on qualified-immunity grounds, contending thathis actions had not violated any "clearly established" rightof respondent regarding his employment at Pioneer or elsewhere. The District Court denied the motion with the unadorned statement that "[m]aterial issues of fact remain asto defendant Behrens on the Bivens claim."

S. 299 (1996)Opinion of the Court5a. Petitioner filed a notice of appeal, which, on respond-ent's motion, the District Court certified as frivolous. In anunpublished order, the Ninth Circuit dismissed the appeal"for lack of jurisdiction." Pelletier v. Federal Home LoanBank of San Francisco, No. 94-56507 (CA9, Nov. 17, 1994),reprinted in App. to Pet. for Cert. 1a. We granted certiorari, 514 U. S. 1035 (1995). IISection 1291 of Title 28, U. S. C., gives courts of appealsjurisdiction over "all final decisions" of district courts, exceptthose for which appeal is to be had to this Court. Therequirement of finality precludes consideration of decisionsthat are subject to revision, and even of "fully consummateddecisions [that] are but steps towards final judgment inwhich they will merge." Cohen v. Beneficial IndustrialLoan Corp., 337 U. S. 541, 546 (1949). It does not, however,bar review of all prejudgment orders. InCohen, we de-scribed a "small class" of district court decisions that, thoughshort of final judgment, are immediately appealable becausethey "finally determine claims of right separable from, andcollateral to, rights asserted in the action, too important tobe denied review and too independent of the cause itself torequire that appellate consideration be deferred until thewhole case is adjudicated."Ibid. See also Puerto RicoAqueduct and Sewer Authority v. Metcalf & Eddy, Inc.,506 U. S. 139, 142-145 (1993) (citing Coopers & Lybrand v.Livesay, 437 U. S. 463, 468 (1978)). The issue in the presentcase is the extent to which orders denying governmentalofficers' assertions of qualified immunity come within theCohen category of appealable decisions.As set forth inHarlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800 (1982),the qualified-immunity defense "shield[s] [governmentagents] from liability for civil damages insofar as their con-duct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would haveknown," id., at 818 (citing Procunier v. Navarette, 434 U. S.516us2$22k 10-22-98 12:37:53 PAGES OPINPGT306 BEHRENS v. PELLETIEROpinion of the Court555, 565 (1978)). Harlow adopted this criterion of "objectivelegal reasonableness," rather than good faith, precisely inorder to "permit the defeat of insubstantial claims withoutresort to trial." 457 U. S., at 819, 813. Unsurprisingly,then, we later found the immunity to be "an entitlement notto stand trial or face the other burdens of litigation, conditioned on the resolution of the essentially legal [immunity]question." Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U. S., at 526. And, aswith district-court rejection of claims to other such entitlements distinct from the merits, see, e. g., Puerto Rico Aqueduct, supra, at 145-146 (Eleventh Amendment immunity);Abney v. United States, 431 U. S. 651, 662 (1977) (right notto be subjected to double jeopardy), we held that "a districtcourt's denial of a claim of qualified immunity, to the extentthat it turns on an issue of law, is an appealable `final decision' within the meaning of 28 U. S. C. $ 1291 notwithstanding the absence of a final judgment." Mitchell, supra, at530. See also Johnson v. Jones, 515 U. S. 304, 311-312(1995).While Mitchell did not say that a defendant could appealfrom denial of a qualified-immunity defense more than once,2it clearly contemplated that he could raise the defense atsuccessive stages:"Unless the plaintiff 's allegations state a claim of violation of clearly established law, a defendant pleadingqualified immunity is entitled to dismissal before thecommencement of discovery. Even if the plaintiff 'scomplaint adequately alleges the commission of acts thatviolated clearly established law, the defendant is entitledto summary judgment if discovery fails to uncover evi2 Interestingly, however, Mitchell itself dealt with the second of twointerlocutory appeals on immunity claims. See 472 U. S., at 515-519.Neither the Court of Appeals nor this Court assigned any significance tothe successive aspect of the second appeal.516us2$22k 10-22-98 12:37:53 PAGES OPINPGT307Cite as: 516 U. S. 299 (1996)Opinion of the Courtdence sufficient to create a genuine issue as to whetherthe defendant in fact committed those acts." 472 U. S.,at 526 (citation omitted).Thus, Mitchell clearly establishes that an order rejecting thedefense of qualified immunity at either the dismissal stageor the summary judgment stage is a "final" judgment subjectto immediate appeal. Since an unsuccessful appeal from adenial of dismissal cannot possibly render the later denial ofa motion for summary judgment any less "final," it followsthat petitioner's appeal falls within $ 1291 and dismissalwas improper.Indeed, it is easier to argue that the denial of summaryjudgment--the order sought to be appealed here--is themore "final" of the two orders. That is the reasoning theFirst Circuit adopted in holding that denial of a motion todismiss on absolute-immunity grounds was not "final" wherethe defendant had stated that, if unsuccessful, he would laterseek summary judgment on qualified-immunity grounds:"Since the district court has not yet determined whether [thedefendant] has qualified immunity, and that he will have tostand trial, its decision is not an appealable collateral order."Kaiter v. Boxford, 836 F. 2d 704, 707 (1988). The problemwith this approach, however, is that it would logically barany appeal at the motion-to-dismiss stage where there is apossibility of presenting an immunity defense on summaryjudgment; that possibility would cause the motion-to-dismissdecision to be not "final" as to the defendant's right not tostand trial. The First Circuit sought to avoid this difficultyby saying that the defendant could render the motion-todismiss denial final by waiving his right to appeal the summary judgment denial. See id., at 708. But quite obviously, eliminating the ability to appeal the second order doesnot eliminate the possibility that the second order will vindicate the defendant's right not to stand trial, and therefore516us2$22k 10-22-98 12:37:53 PAGES OPINPGT308 BEHRENS v. PELLETIEROpinion of the Courtdoes not eliminate the supposed reason for declaring the firstorder nonfinal.The source of the First Circuit's confusion was its mistaken conception of the scope of protection afforded by qualified immunity. Harlow and Mitchell make clear that thedefense is meant to give government officials a right, notmerely to avoid "standing trial," but also to avoid the burdens of "such pretrial matters as discovery . . . , as `[i]nquiries of this kind can be peculiarly disruptive of effectivegovernment.' " Mitchell, supra, at 526 (emphasis added)(quoting from Harlow, supra, at 817). Whether or not alater summary judgment motion is granted, denial of a motion to dismiss is conclusive as to this right. We would havethought that these and other statements from Mitchell andHarlow had settled the point, questioned by JusticeBreyer, see post, at 317, that this right is important enoughto support an immediate appeal. If it were not, however,the consequence would be, not that only one pretrial appealcould be had in a given case, as Justice Breyer proposes,but rather, that there could be no immediate appeal fromdenial of a motion to dismiss but only from denial of summaryjudgment. That conclusion is foreclosed by Mitchell, whichunmistakably envisioned immediate appeal of "[t]he denial ofa defendant's motion for dismissal or summary judgment onthe ground of qualified immunity." 472 U. S., at 527.The Court of Appeals in the present case, in the first of itstwo decisions, rested its "one-appeal" pronouncement uponthe proposition that resolving the question of entitlement toqualified immunity "should not require more than one judiciously timed appeal." Pelletier, 968 F. 2d, at 871. It didnot explain how this proposition pertains to the question offinality, but we suppose it could be argued that a category ofappeals thought to be needless or superfluous does not raisea claim of right "too important to be denied review," as ourCohen finality jurisprudence requires, see 337 U. S., at 546.516us2$22k 10-22-98 12:37:53 PAGES OPINPGT309Cite as: 516 U. S. 299 (1996)Opinion of the CourtIn any event, the proposition is not sound. That one appealon the immunity issue may not be enough is illustrated bythe history of respondent's claims for loss of employment atPioneer in the present case. Because these claims had initially been dismissed as time barred, the Court of Appealsrefused to decide (and thus evidently regarded as an openquestion) whether one who holds his job subject to regulatory approval can assert a constitutionally cognizable expectation of continued employment. See Pelletier, supra, at871-872. Thus, the question whether petitioner was entitled to immunity on these claims was not presented to anycourt until petitioner's summary judgment motion--and, byoperation of the Ninth Circuit's one-appeal rule, has neverbeen addressed by an appellate court.That is assuredly an unusual set of circumstances, but evenin a case proceeding in a more normal fashion resolution ofthe immunity question may "require more than one judiciously timed appeal," because the legally relevant factorsbearing upon the Harlow question will be different on summary judgment than on an earlier motion to dismiss. Atthat earlier stage, it is the defendant's conduct as alleged inthe complaint that is scrutinized for "objective legal reasonableness." On summary judgment, however, the plaintiffcan no longer rest on the pleadings, see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.56, and the court looks to the evidence before it (in the lightmost favorable to the plaintiff) when conducting the Harlowinquiry. It is no more true that the defendant who has unsuccessfully appealed denial of a motion to dismiss has noneed to appeal denial of a motion for summary judgment,than it is that the defendant who has unsuccessfully made amotion to dismiss has no need to make a motion for summary judgment.33 Justice Breyer suggests that the second of two pretrial qualifiedimmunity appeals does not come within Cohen's class of immediately ap516us2$22k 10-22-98 12:37:53 PAGES OPINPGT310 BEHRENS v. PELLETIEROpinion of the CourtThe Court of Appeals expressed concern that a second appeal would tend to have the illegitimate purpose of delayingthe proceedings. See 968 F. 2d, at 870-871. Undeniably,the availability of a second appeal affords an opportunity forabuse, but we have no reason to believe that abuse has oftenoccurred. To the contrary, successive pretrial assertions ofimmunity seem to be a rare occurrence.4 Moreover, if andwhen abuse does occur, as we observed in the analogous context of interlocutory appeals on the issue of double jeopardy,"[i]t is well within the supervisory powers of the courts ofappeals to establish summary procedures and calendars toweed out frivolous claims." Abney, 431 U. S., at 662, n. 8.In the present case, for example, the District Court appropriately certified petitioner's immunity appeal as "frivolous"in light of the Court of Appeals' (unfortunately erroneous)one-appeal precedent. This practice, which has been embraced by several Circuits, enables the district court to repealable final orders because it is insufficiently "separable" from the claimraised on the first appeal, see post, at 316. But the Cohen "separability"component asks whether the question to be resolved on appeal is "conceptually distinct from the merits of the plaintiff's claim." Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U. S. 511, 527 (1985). The appropriate comparison, then, is between the decision sought to be reviewed and the claim underlying theaction itself--not between the decision and any previous appeal, as Justice Breyer suggests. And again, Mitchell clearly states that a denialof qualified immunity, whether on a motion for dismissal or summary judgment, is an "appealable `final decision.' " Id., at 530.4 We are aware of only five reported cases--Mitchell itself, Nelson v.Silverman, 999 F. 2d 417 (CA9 1993), Abel v. Miller, 904 F. 2d 394 (CA71990), Francis v. Coughlin, 891 F. 2d 43 (CA2 1989), and the presentcase--in which Courts of Appeals have been twice asked to review successive pretrial assertions of immunity. See Abel, supra, at 396 ("Paucity ofprecedent [on successive interlocutory appeals] must reflect the forbearance of public officials rather than lack of opportunity"); Kaiter v. Boxford,836 F. 2d 704, 706 (CA1 1988) ("[I]n every case we have found which permitted interlocutory review of an immunity ruling, the defendant's entireclaim to immunity was raised in a single proceeding").516us2$22k 10-22-98 12:37:53 PAGES OPINPGT311Cite as: 516 U. S. 299 (1996)Opinion of the Courttain jurisdiction pending summary disposition of the appeal,and thereby minimizes disruption of the ongoing proceedings. See, e. g., Chuman v. Wright, 960 F. 2d 104, 105 (CA91992); Yates v. Cleveland, 941 F. 2d 444, 448-449 (CA6 1991);Stewart v. Donges, 915 F. 2d 572, 576-577 (CA10 1990); Apostol v. Gallion, 870 F. 2d 1335, 1339 (CA7 1989). In anyevent, the question before us here--whether there is jurisdiction over the appeal, as opposed to whether the appeal isfrivolous--must be determined by focusing upon the category of order appealed from, rather than upon the strengthof the grounds for reversing the order. "Appeal rights cannot depend on the facts of a particular case." Carroll v.United States, 354 U. S. 394, 405 (1957). See also DigitalEquipment Corp. v. Desktop Direct, Inc., 511 U. S. 863, 868(1994). As we have said, an order denying qualified immu-nity, to the extent it turns on an "issue of law," Mitchell, 472U. S., at 530, is immediately appealable.IIIOur rejection of the one-interlocutory-appeal rule does notdispose of this case. Respondent proposes two other reasons why appeal of denial of the summary judgment motionis not available. First, he argues that no appeal is availablewhere, even if the District Court's qualified-immunity rulingis reversed, the defendant will be required to endure discovery and trial on matters separate from the claims againstwhich immunity was asserted. Respondent reasons that aruling which does not reach all the claims does not "conclu-sively determin[e] the defendant's claim of right not to standtrial," id., at 527, and thus the order denying immunity can-not be said to be "final" within the meaning ofCohen.It is far from clear that, given the procedural posture ofthe present case, respondent would be entitled to the benefitof the proposition for which he argues; but we will addressthe proposition on its merits. The Courts of Appeals have516us2$22k 10-22-98 12:37:53 PAGES OPINPGT312 BEHRENS v. PELLETIEROpinion of the Courtalmost unanimously rejected it,5 and so do we. The Harlowright to immunity is a right to immunity from certainclaims, not from litigation in general; when immunity withrespect to those claims has been finally denied, appeal mustbe available, and cannot be foreclosed by the mere additionof other claims to the suit. Making appealability dependupon such a factor, particular to the case at hand, would vio-late the principle discussed above, that appealability determinations are made for classes of decisions, not individualorders in specific cases. Apart from these objections inprinciple, the practical effect of respondent's proposal wouldbe intolerable. If the district court rules erroneously, thequalified-immunity right not to be subjected to pretrial pro-ceedings will be eliminated, so long as the plaintiff has alleged (with or without evidence to back it up) violation ofone "clearly established" right; and both that and the furtherright not to be subjected to trial itself will be eliminated, solong as the complaint seeks injunctive relief (for which no"clearly established" right need be alleged).Second, respondent asserts that appeal of denial of thesummary judgment motion is not available because the de-nial rested on the ground that "[m]aterial issues of fact remain." This, he contends, renders the denial unappealableunder last Term's decision inJohnson v. Jones, 515 U. S., at313-318. That is a misreading of the case. Denial of summary judgment often includes a determination that there arecontroverted issues of material fact, see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.5 See, e. g., McLaurin v. Morton, 48 F. 3d 944, 949 (CA6 1995); Green v.Brantley, 941 F. 2d 1146, 1148-1151 (CA11 1991) (en banc); Di Martini v.Ferrin, 889 F. 2d 922, 924-925 (CA9 1989), cert. denied, 501 U.

Arnold, 742 F. 2d 401, 403-404(CA8 1984). Only the Third Circuit holds otherwise. See Prisco v.United States Dept. of Justice, 851 F. 2d 93, 95-96, cert. denied, 490 U. S.1089 (1989).516us2$22k 10-22-98 12:37:53 PAGES OPINPGT313Cite as: 516 U. S. 299 (1996)Opinion of the Court56, and Johnson surely does not mean that every such denialof summary judgment is nonappealable. Johnson held, simply, that determinations of evidentiary sufficiency at summary judgment are not immediately appealable merely because they happen to arise in a qualified-immunity case; ifwhat is at issue in the sufficiency determination is nothingmore than whether the evidence could support a finding thatparticular conduct occurred, the question decided is not truly"separable" from the plaintiff 's claim, and hence there is no"final decision" under Cohen and Mitchell. See 515 U. S., at313-318. Johnson reaffirmed that summary judgment determinations are appealable when they resolve a dispute concerning an "abstract issu[e] of law" relating to qualifiedimmunity, id., at 317--typically, the issue whether the federal right allegedly infringed was "clearly established," see,e. g., Mitchell, supra, at 530-535; Davis v. Scherer, 468 U. S.183, 190-193 (1984).Here the District Court's denial of petitioner's summaryjudgment motion necessarily determined that certain conduct attributed to petitioner (which was controverted) constituted a violation of clearly established law. Johnson permits petitioner to claim on appeal that all of the conductwhich the District Court deemed sufficiently supported forpurposes of summary judgment met the Harlow standard of"objective legal reasonableness." This argument was presented by petitioner in the trial court, and there is no apparent impediment to its being raised on appeal. And while theDistrict Court, in denying petitioner's summary judgmentmotion, did not identify the particular charged conduct thatit deemed adequately supported, Johnson recognizes thatunder such circumstances "a court of appeals may have toundertake a cumbersome review of the record to determinewhat facts the district court, in the light most favorable tothe nonmoving party, likely assumed." Johnson, supra, at319. That is the task now facing the Court of Appeals inthis case.516us2$22k 10-22-98 12:37:53 PAGES OPINPGT314 BEHRENS v. PELLETIERBreyer, J., dissentingThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, andthe case is remanded for proceedings consistent with thisopinion. It is so ordered.Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Stevens joins,dissenting.I do not agree with the Court's holding that those assert-ing a defense of qualified immunity are entitled, as a matterof course, to more than one interlocutory appeal. Rather, inmy view, the law normally permits a single interlocutory appeal, and not more than one such appeal, from denials of adefendant's pretrial motions to dismiss a case on grounds ofqualified immunity. The "collateral order" doctrine's basicrationale, this Court's precedents, and several practical considerations lead to this conclusion.IThis Court's basic rationale for permitting an interlocutoryappeal of a "collateral order" recognizes that interlocutoryappeals are the exception, not the rule. Congress, withstatutory exceptions not directly relevant here, has authorized appeals from "final" orders. 28 U. S. C. $ 1291. Inthat way,"Congress . . . , by forbidding piecemeal disposition onappeal of what for practical purposes is a single controversy, set itself against enfeebling judicial administra-tion [and] . . . the obstruction to just claims that wouldcome from permitting the harassment and cost of a suc-cession of separate appeals from the various rulings towhich a litigation may give rise, from its initiation toentry of judgment."Cobbledick v. United States, 309U. S. 323, 325 (1940).Judges have nonetheless created what is, in effect, a non-statutory exception, authorizing a special set of interlocutory516us2$22q 10-22-98 12:37:53 PAGES OPINPGT315Cite as: 516 U. S. 299 (1996)Breyer, J., dissentingappeals, where a trial court's interlocutory order is a "collat-eral order" that satisfies the statutory term "final" for purposes of $ 1291. See Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial LoanCorp., 337 U. S. 541, 545-547 (1949). The trial court's interlocutory order is "collateral" (and "final"), however, onlywhere it meets certain requirements. It must (1) "conclu-sively determine [a] disputed question," (2) "resolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the ac-tion," and (3) "be effectively unreviewable on appeal from afinal judgment." Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U. S.463, 468 (1978).These requirements explain why the courts have createdthe "collateral order" exception. The "effective unreviewability" requirement means that failure to review the orderon appeal now may cause a litigant permanent harm. The"conclusive determination" requirement means that appellate review now is likely needed to avoid that harm. The"separability" requirement means that review now will notlikely force an appellate court to consider the same (or quitesimilar) questions more than once. Johnson v. Jones, 515U. S. 304, 311 (1995). Taken together, these requirements,as set forth in the Court's cases, see, e. g., ibid.; MidlandAsphalt Corp. v. United States, 489 U. S. 794, 799 (1989);Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. v. Mayacamas Corp., 485 U. S.271, 276 (1988), help pick out a class of orders where theerror-correcting benefits of immediate appeal likely outweigh the costs, delays, diminished litigation coherence, andwaste of appellate court time potentially associated withmultiple appeals. See, e. g., Johnson, supra, at 309-311; R.Posner, Economic Analysis of Law 585-587 (4th ed. 1992).In Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U. S. 511 (1985), the Court applied this rationale to a District Court order denying a claimof qualified immunity. The Court concluded that the District Court order, by sending the case to trial, could causethe litigant what (in terms of the immunity doctrine's basictrial-avoiding purpose) would amount to an important harm.516us2$22q 10-22-98 12:37:53 PAGES OPINPGT316 BEHRENS v. PELLETIERBreyer, J., dissentingSee id., at 526-527. Post-trial appellate review would cometoo late to avoid that harm. Ibid. And, the legal issue(where purely legal, see Johnson, supra, at 313-318) wouldoften prove "separate" enough from the more basic substantive issues in the case to avoid significant duplication of appellate court time and effort. See 472 U. S., at 527-529; butsee id., at 545-550 (Brennan, J., dissenting). Hence, the"collateral order" doctrine's basic rationale supported interlocutory appeal.That same rationale, however, does not support two pretrial interlocutory appeals, the first from a denial of a motionto dismiss a complaint, the second from a later, postappeal,denial of a motion for summary judgment. Consider the"separability" requirement. Both orders satisfy the literalterms of that requirement because the qualified immunityissues they resolve are both "separate," in equal measure,from the merits of the plaintiff 's claim. See ante, at 309-310, n. 3. But the reasoned principles and purposes underlying the "separability" requirement are not served by a rulethat permits both orders to be appealed because the issuesthey raise are not normally "separate" one from the other.Rather, they will often involve quite similar issues, likelypresented to different appellate court panels, thereby riskingthe very duplication and waste of appellate resources thatthe courts intended the "separability" requirement to avoid.See 15A C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practiceand Procedure $ 3911, pp. 333-334 (2d ed. 1992) (hereinafterWright & Miller).Similarly, given the law's promise of one pretrial interlocutory appeal, a litigant's need for a second is much less pressing. The single interlocutory appeal can avoid much of,though not all of, the harm that Mitchell found. And, theremaining harm, as I shall next discuss, is not of a kind thatthe law considers important enough to justify an interlocutory appeal.516us2$22q 10-22-98 12:37:53 PAGES OPINPGT317Cite as: 516 U. S. 299 (1996)Breyer, J., dissentingIIThis Court's precedents justify one interlocutory appeal,but not more, in the ordinary qualified immunity case.When it initially set forth the "collateral order" exception,the Court said that it applied to "that small class" of ordersthat determine claims of right "too important to be denied[immediate] review."Cohen, supra, at 546 (emphasisadded). In subsequent cases, and again today, the Court hasreiterated that, to qualify for interlocutory appeal, the inter-est being asserted must be animportant one. See, e. g.,ante, at 308; Digital Equipment Corp. v. Desktop Direct,Inc., 511 U. S. 863, 878-879 (1994) (Cohen inquiry "simplycannot be answered without a judgment about the value ofthe interests that would be lost through rigorous applicationof a final judgment requirement"); Coopers & Lybrand,supra, at 468 (disputed question must "resolve an importantissue");Richardson-Merrell Inc. v. Koller, 472 U. S. 424, 436(1985); see also Lauro Lines s.r.l. v. Chasser, 490 U. S. 495,502 (1989) (Scalia, J., concurring) ("The importance of theright asserted has always been a significant part of our collateral order doctrine"). Because one pretrial appeal wouldnormally prove sufficient to protect a government defendant's qualified immunity interest in not standing trial, theright to take multiple interlocutory appeals will normallyprotect only the defendant's additional interest in avoidingsuchpretrial burdens as discovery. Thus, the question, asJustice Scalia has pointed out, is whether this antidiscovery interest is "sufficiently important to overcome the poli-cies militating against interlocutory appeals."Id., at 503(emphasis added). The relevant precedent indicates that, inthe context of qualified immunity, it is not.For one thing, the Court, when considering the kinds oforders that warrant interlocutory appeal, has identified as"sufficiently important" interests that are considerably moreimportant than the ordinary interest in avoiding discovery.516us2$22q 10-22-98 12:37:53 PAGES OPINPGT318 BEHRENS v. PELLETIERBreyer, J., dissentingSee, e. g., Stack v. Boyle, 342 U. S. 1 (1951) (interest in avoiding imprisonment; Excessive Bail Clause, U. S. Const., Amdt.8); Abney v. United States, 431 U. S. 651 (1977) (interest inavoiding trial; Double Jeopardy Clause, U. S. Const., Amdt.5); Helstoski v. Meanor, 442 U. S. 500 (1979) (interest inavoiding trial; Speech or Debate Clause, U. S.

Const., Amdt.11).For another thing, the Court has often said that the trouble, expense, and possible embarrassment associated withunnecessary litigation (interests rather like the qualified immunity antidiscovery interest) do not justify interlocutoryappeal. See, e. g., Digital Equipment Corp., supra, at 881-882 (no interlocutory review of orders refusing to enforce asettlement agreement); Lauro Lines, supra, at 499 (no interlocutory review of orders refusing to enforce a forum selection clause); Van Cauwenberghe v. Biard, 486 U. S. 517, 524(1988) (no interlocutory review of orders refusing to dismissa civil suit on grounds of immunity from civil process orforum non conveniens).Further, until now litigants have not been able routinelyto vindicate, through immediate appeal, a legal right to avoiddiscovery, 15B Wright & Miller $ 3914.23, at 123-130, evenwhere the Constitution provides that antidiscovery right,see, e. g., Maness v. Meyers, 419 U. S. 449, 458-461 (1975) (nointerlocutory appeal of order refusing to quash subpoena formaterials that arguably violated subpoenaed party's FifthAmendment privilege against self-incrimination). Althougha litigant can sometimes appeal an adverse discovery ruling,to do so, the litigant typically must disobey the discoveryorder and then appeal a resulting citation for contempt ofcourt. Church of Scientology of Cal. v. United States, 506U. S. 9, 18, n. 11 (1992); Maness, supra, at 460-461; United516us2$22q 10-22-98 12:37:53 PAGES OPINPGT319Cite as: 516 U.

Nixon, 418U. S. 683, 691 (1974) (allowing President Nixon to appealfrom a discovery order without first incurring a contemptcitation, because "traditional contempt avenue to immediateappeal" would be "peculiarly inappropriate"). This "disobedience and contempt" requirement (somewhat analogous to aone-appeal limitation here) works, in part, because it "encourages reconsideration both by the party resisting discovery and by the party seeking discovery, and in part becauseit tends to limit appeals to issues that are both importantand reasonably likely to lead to reversal." 15B Wright &Miller $ 3914.23, at 154; see also Pennsylvania v. Ritchie, 480U. S. 39, 50, n. 8 (1987) (disobedience and contempt procedure"rests on an implicit assumption that unless a party resistingdiscovery is willing to risk being held in contempt, the significance of his claim is insufficient to justify interrupting theongoing proceedings").It seems highly anomalous for the law to deny a routineinterlocutory appeal where the Constitution of the UnitedStates protects an antidiscovery interest, but to permit aroutine appeal where the legal doctrine of qualified immunityprotects a similar interest. Yet, today's holding will eithercreate just such an anomaly, or, as is more likely, it willgenerate many new interlocutory appeals as lower courtsapply its principle wherever the Constitution, or otherimportant legal doctrine, offers a litigant special antidiscovery protection.The majority suggests that the importance of the antidiscovery interest protected by qualified immunity has already been "settled" by such precedents as Mitchell v.Forsyth, 472 U. S. 511 (1985), and Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457U. S. 800 (1982). See ante, at 308. These cases do say thatthe qualified immunity defense, in its modern formulation,516us2$22q 10-22-98 12:37:54 PAGES OPINPGT320 BEHRENS v. PELLETIERBreyer, J., dissentingwas meant, in part, "to protect public officials from the`broad-ranging discovery' that can be `peculiarly disruptiveof effective government.' " Anderson v. Creighton, 483U. S. 635, 646, n. 6 (1987) (quotingHarlow, supra, at 817).But the Court's decision in Mitchell (that district court orders denying qualified immunity are immediately appealable)was concerned primarily with preserving defendants' immunity from trial, not discovery. See 472 U. S., at 525 ("At theheart of the issue before us is the question whether qualifiedimmunity . . . is in fact an entitlement not to stand trial");see alsoVan Cauwenberghe, supra, at 524 ("The criticalquestion, following Mitchell, is whether `the essence' of theclaimed right is a right not to stand trial"). The Court hasnever before suggested, much less "settled," that the government defendant's antidiscovery interest--independent of hisinterest in avoiding trial--is so important that it must besafeguarded by interlocutory appellate review.Finally, this Court and its individual Members have, inrecent years, cautioned against expanding the class of orderseligible for interlocutory appeal. See, e. g., Digital Equipment Corp. v. Desktop Direct, Inc., 511 U. S., at 868 (opinionof Souter, J.) ("[T]he `narrow' exception should stay thatway and never be allowed to swallow the general rule");Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. v. Mayacamas Corp., 485 U. S.,at 292 (Scalia, J., concurring) ("[The Court's] finality jurisprudence is sorely in need of further limiting principles, sothat Cohen appeals will be, as we originally announced theywould be, a `small class [of decisions] . . . too important to bedenied review' "); Richardson-Merrell Inc. v. Koller, 472U. S., at 440 (opinion of O'Connor, J.) ("[W]e decline to`transform the limited exception carved out in Cohen into alicense for broad disregard of the finality rule imposed byCongress in $ 1291' ") (quoting Firestone Tire & Rubber Co.v. Risjord, 449 U. S. 368, 378 (1981)). Caution would seemespecially appropriate where the Court is considering notone interlocutory appeal in a single case, but two.516us2$22q 10-22-98 12:37:54 PAGES OPINPGT321Cite as: 516 U. S. 299 (1996)Breyer, J., dissentingIIISeveral important practical considerations also favor limit-ing the number of interlocutory qualified immunity appealsto one. The majority finds the necessary special harm inthe fact that the qualified immunity doctrine protects publicofficials against discovery as well as trial; and it finds "sepa-rability" in the fact that a postdiscovery summary judgmentmotion likely asks a legal question that is conceptually dis-tinct from the legal question posed by a prediscovery motionto dismiss a complaint. But, given this rationale, can onelimit the number of appeals to just one or two? Would itnot, in principle, justify several appeals where discovery,proceeding in stages, continuously turns up new facts, orwhere, after the close of the plaintiff 's case, an immediateappeal would avoid the litigation burden of presenting anentire defense case.Still, even two pretrial appeals risk what Justice Storycalled "very great delays, and oppressive expenses," Canterv.American Ins. Co., 3 Pet. 307, 318 (1830), which can "ossifycivil rights litigation," Abel v. Miller, 904 F. 2d 394, 396 (CA71990) (Easterbrook, J.). The defendant in the present case,for example, so far has spent more than four years (of sevensince the complaint's filing) fighting, through interlocutoryappeal, a case that he might well have won more quickly andeasily either in the trial court or on appeal from an initiallyadverse judgment on the merits. Cf.Pelletier v. FederalHome Loan Bank of San Francisco, 968 F. 2d 865, 872-873(CA9 1992) (expressing doubt that plaintiff 's complaint couldsurvive a summary judgment motion). I concede that everyadded interlocutory appeal will serve the interests that un-derlie qualified immunity to some extent, for each will helpa government defendant terminate meritless litigation. Buteach added appeal likely would serve those interests to anever-diminishing degree while posing an ever-increasingthreat to the appearance of evenhanded justice in civil rightscases. See Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U. S., at 476516us2$22q 10-22-98 12:37:54 PAGES OPINPGT322 BEHRENS v. PELLETIERBreyer, J., dissenting(no immediate appeal of prejudgment order denying classcertification, in part because such appeals would "operat[e]only in favor of plaintiffs").Further, as mentioned above, the majority's rationalethreatens added appeals, not simply in qualified immunitycases, but wherever an immunity-type doctrine (or any otherimportant legal rule) seeks to protect litigants from trial.See, e. g., Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority v.Metcalf & Eddy, Inc., 506 U. S. 139 (1993) (Eleventh Amendment immunity); Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 731 (1982)(absolute immunity);Abney v. United States, 431 U. S. 651(1977) (double jeopardy guarantee against successive prosecutions). It thereby threatens busy appellate courts withadded numbers of essentially similar, if not repetitive,appeals, at a time when overloaded dockets threaten thefederal appellate system. See Remarks of Chief JusticeWilliam H. Rehnquist, Tenth Annual Judicial Conference ofthe United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit,146 F. R. D. 256, 257 (Apr. 30, 1992) ("One of the chief needsof our generation is to deal with the current appellate capacity crisis in the Federal Courts of Appeals. Few couldargue about the existence of such a crisis, born of spiralingfederal filings and an increased tendency to appeal DistrictCourt decisions"); Judicial Conference of the United States,Long Range Plan for the Federal Courts 132 (Dec. 1995)("[I]f conditions seriously deteriorate in the courts of appeals, it may be necessary to consider some limitations onthe right to appeal"). See generally T. Baker, RationingJustice on Appeal: The Problems of the U. S. Courts ofAppeals 31-51 (1994).Finally, as a practical matter, where the benefits of immediate appellate review predominate in an individual case, aparty still can seek court leave to appeal immediately under28 U. S. C. $ 1292(b) (permitting immediate review of nonfinalorders that involve a controlling and controversial questionof law, the appellate resolution of which "may materially516us2$22q 10-22-98 12:37:54 PAGES OPINPGT323Cite as: 516 U. S. 299 (1996)Breyer, J., dissentingadvance the ultimate termination of the litigation"). ThisCourt has frequently observed that the availability of$ 1292(b) review counsels against expanding other judicialexceptions to the rule against piecemeal appeals. See, e. g.,Swint v. Chambers County Comm'n, 514 U. S. 35, 45-47(1995);Digital Equipment Corp., 511 U. S., at 883; Van Cau-wenberghe v. Biard, 486 U. S., at 529-530; RichardsonMerrell Inc., 472 U. S., at 435; Firestone Tire & Rubber Co.,449 U. S., at 378, n. 13; Coopers & Lybrand, supra, at 474-475, and n. 27; see also Parkinson v. April Industries, Inc.,520 F. 2d 650, 658-660 (CA2 1975) (Friendly, J., concurring).We should be especially reluctant to identify new categoriesof "collateral orders" now that Congress has, by adding 28U. S. C. $ 2072(c) to the Rules Enabling Act, "designat[ed] . . .the rulemaking process as the way to define or refine whena district court ruling is `final' and when an interlocutoryorder is appealable."Swint, supra, at 48.IVIn sum, purpose, precedent, and practicality all argue forone interlocutory qualified immunity appeal per case and nomore. I believe that the Court, following Mitchell, shouldsimply hold that qualified immunity interests, while important enough to justify one interlocutory appeal, are not im-portant enough to justify two. It is not necessary to argueabout whether the defendant "waived" a second appeal, seeKaiter v. Boxford, 836 F. 2d 704, 708 (CA1 1988); nor, sincethe matter turns on "importance," not conclusiveness, needthe Court decide just how the timing of an interlocutoryappeal affects the "finality" of the trial court's denial of amotion to dismiss the complaint. Seeante, at 307-308.Rather, a defendant asserting qualified immunity would remain free, as at present, to appeal from a denial of a motionto dismiss the complaint, or the defendant could wait, movefor summary judgment, and appeal the motion's denial, buthe could not do both--either because the interest asserted516us2$22q 10-22-98 12:37:54 PAGES OPINPGT324 BEHRENS v. PELLETIERBreyer, J., dissentingin a first pretrial appeal is insufficiently important if the pos-sibility remains of a second pretrial appeal, or because theinterest asserted in a second pretrial appeal is insufficientlyimportant if there has already been a first pretrial appeal.As I said, precedent permits this result because, underthat precedent, theimportance of the interest (an interlocu-tory appeal is needed to protect) is one necessary requirement for application of the technical legal labels "final" or"collateral order." More importantly, meaning in law depends upon an understanding of purpose. Law's words,however technical they may sound, are not magic formulas;they must be read in light of their purposes, if we are toavoid essentially arbitrary applications and harmful results.For the reasons I have set forth, precedent, read in this way,does more than permit--it requires--a single interlocutoryappeal. I therefore dissent.516us2$23Z 10-22-98 12:42:45 PAGES OPINPGT325OCTOBER TERM, 1995SyllabusFULTON CORP. v. FAULKNER, SECRETARY OFREVENUE OF NORTH CAROLINAcertiorari to the supreme court of north carolinaNo. 94-1239. Argued October 31, 1995--Decided February 21, 1996During the period in question here, North Carolina levied an "intangiblestax" on a fraction of the value of corporate stock owned by state residents inversely proportional to the corporation's exposure to the State'sincome tax. Petitioner Fulton Corporation, a North Carolina company,filed a state-court action against respondent State Secretary of Revenue, seeking a declaratory judgment that this tax violated the Commerce Clause and a refund of the 1990 tax it had paid on stock it ownedin out-of-state corporations that did only part or none of their businessin the State. The trial court ruled for the Secretary, but the Court ofAppeals reversed. In reversing the Court of Appeals, the North Carolina Supreme Court found that the State's scheme imposed a valid compensatory tax under Darnell v. Indiana, 226 U. S. 390. It thus rejectedFulton's contention that Darnell had been overruled by this Court'smore recent decisions and found that the intangibles tax imposed lessof a burden on interstate commerce than the corporate income taxplaced on intrastate commerce.Held: North Carolina's intangibles tax discriminates against interstatecommerce in violation of the dormant Commerce Clause. Pp. 330-347.(a) State laws discriminating against interstate commerce on theirface are "virtually per se invalid." Oregon Waste Systems, Inc. v. Department of Environmental Quality of Ore., 511 U. S. 93, 99. However, a facially discriminatory tax may survive Commerce Clause scrutiny if it is a truly " `compensatory tax' designed simply to makeinterstate commerce bear a burden already borne by intrastate commerce." Associated Industries of Mo. v. Lohman, 511 U. S. 641, 647.The tax at issue is clearly facially discriminatory, and therefore it mustmeet three conditions to be considered a valid compensatory tax, seeOregon Waste, supra, at 103. The Secretary has failed to show that thetax satisfies any of the requirements. Pp. 330-334.(b) To meet the first condition, a State must identify the intrastatetax burden for which it is attempting to compensate, Oregon Waste,supra, at 103, and the intrastate tax must serve some purpose for whichthe State may otherwise impose a burden on interstate commerce. SeeMaryland v. Louisiana, 451 U. S. 725, 759. The Secretary claims thatthe intangibles tax compensates for the burden of the general corporate516us2$23Z 10-22-98 12:42:45 PAGES OPINPGT326 FULTON CORP. v. FAULKNERSyllabusincome tax paid by corporations doing business in North Carolina andthat the state service supported by the corporate income tax is themaintenance of an intrastate capital market. This Court, however, hasrecognized the danger of treating general revenue measures as relevantintrastate burdens for purposes of the compensatory tax doctrine. Oregon Waste, supra, at 105, n. 8. Moreover, it can reasonably be assumedthat the State's blue sky laws, not its general corporate income tax,provide for the capital market's upkeep. Thus, the Secretary haspointed to no in-state activity or benefit that justifies the compensatorylevy. Pp. 334-336.(c) The second condition requires that the tax on interstate commerceapproximate, but not exceed, the tax on intrastate commerce. OregonWaste, supra, at 103. The relevant comparison--between the size ofthe intangibles tax and that of the corporate income tax component thatpurportedly funds the capital market--is for practical purposes impossible. The corporate income tax is a general form of taxation, not assessed according to the taxpayer's use of particular services, and beforeits revenues are earmarked for particular purposes they have been commingled with funds from other sources. Hence, the Secretary cannotshow what proportion of that tax goes to support the capital market, orwhether that proportion represents a burden greater than the one theintangibles tax imposes on interstate commerce. Pp. 336-338.(d) The third condition requires the compensating taxes to fall on substantially equivalent events. The purpose of this requirement is to ensure that the actual payers of each tax are members of the same class,so that the effect of the compensating tax is to enable in-state and outof-state businesses to compete on a footing of equality. Henneford v.Silas Mason Co., 300 U. S. 577. Evaluating whether this requirementhas been met will ordinarily require an analysis of the economic incidence of the respective taxes, an issue usually unsuited for judicial resolution. Here there are reasons to doubt that the relevant taxes havethe same incidences, and while it is unlikely that a State can ever showthat two taxes are equivalent outside the limited confines of sales anduse taxes, it is enough to say here that no such showing has beenmade. Pp. 338-344.(e) Darnell, supra, does not dictate a different result. That case appears to have evaluated a compensatory tax scheme under the rationalbasis standard generally employed under the Equal Protection Clause.In that respect, Darnell, along with Kidd v. Alabama, 188 U. S. 730,has been bypassed by later Commerce Clause decisions, which requirediscriminatory restrictions on commerce to pass the strictest scrutiny.Pp. 344-346.516us2$23Z 10-22-98 12:42:45 PAGES OPINPGT327Cite as: 516 U.

See 1995 N. C.Sess. Laws, ch. 41. Because the repeal has no retroactive effect, however,it does not affect the tax years at issue in this litigation. This case accordingly remains a justiciable controversy. See, e. g., Powell v. McCormack,395 U. S. 486, 498-500 (1969) (holding that the obviation of the petitioner'sclaim for injunctive relief did not render the whole case moot, when adamages claim for backpay remained).516us2$23m 10-22-98 12:42:45 PAGES OPINPGT328 FULTON CORP. v. FAULKNEROpinion of the Courta stated rate of one quarter of one percent, residents wereentitled to calculate their tax liability by taking a taxablepercentage deduction equal to the fraction of the issuing corporation's income subject to tax in North Carolina. Ibid.This figure was set by applying a corporate income taxapportionment formula averaging the portion of the issuing corporation's sales, payroll, and property located in theState. See $ 105-130.4(i).Thus, a corporation doing all of its business within theState would pay corporate income tax on 100% of its income,and the taxable percentage deduction allowed to residentowners of that corporation's stock under the intangibles taxwould likewise be 100%. Stock in a corporation doing nobusiness in North Carolina, on the other hand, would be taxable on 100% of its value. For the intermediate cases, holders of stock were able to look up the taxable percentage fora large number of corporations as determined and publishedannually by the North Carolina Secretary of Revenue (Secretary). In 1990, for example, the Secretary determined theappropriate taxable percentage of IBM stock to be 95%,meaning that IBM did 5% of its business in North Carolina,with its stock held by North Carolina residents being taxableon 95% of its value.

In the 1990 tax year, at issue in this case, Fultonowned shares in six corporations, five of which did no business or earned no income in North Carolina and thereforewere not subject to the State's corporate income tax. Fulton's stock in these corporations was accordingly subject tothe intangibles tax on 100% of its value. Fulton also ownedstock in Food Lion, Inc., which did 46% of its business inNorth Carolina, with the result that its stock was subject tothe intangibles tax on 54% of its value.

E. 2d, at 498.The court rejected the Secretary's contention that the intangibles tax amounted to a valid "compensating tax" designedto place a burden on interstate commerce equal to what intrastate commerce already carried under the corporate income tax. Id., at 499-501, 430 S. E. 2d, at 498-499. Finally,the Court of Appeals distinguished this Court's decision inDarnell v. Indiana, 226 U. S. 390 (1912), which held that Indiana could tax the stock of foreign corporations to the extent that those corporations were not subject to the State'stax on in-state property. Because the tax regime in Darnellwas constructed to avoid the double taxation of corporateproperty values, a result not accomplished by North Carolina's intangibles tax, the Court of Appeals did not view Darnell as being on point. 110 N. C. App., at 501-504, 430 S. E.2d, at 499-501.

The court reasoned, moreover,that corporate income is generally related to the value ofcorporate stock, and that in practice, the burden on inter-state commerce imposed by the intangibles tax was less thanthat placed on intrastate commerce by the corporate incometax.Id., at 479-480, 450 S.

I,$ 8, cl. 3, has long been seen as a limitation on state regula-tory powers, as well as an affirmative grant of congressionalauthority. See, e. g., Oklahoma Tax Comm'n v. JeffersonLines, Inc., 514 U. S. 175, 179-180 (1995); Gibbons v. Ogden,9 Wheat. 1 (1824) (Marshall, C. J.) (dictum).

JeffersonLines, supra, at 180.In evaluating state regulatory measures under the dor-mant Commerce Clause, we have held that "the first step . . .is to determine whether it `regulates evenhandedly with only"incidental" effects on interstate commerce, or discriminatesagainst interstate commerce.' " Oregon Waste Systems, Inc.v.Department of Environmental Quality of Ore., 511 U. S.93, 99 (1994) (quoting Hughes v. Oklahoma, 441 U. S. 322,336 (1979)). With respect to state taxation, one element ofthe protocol summarized inComplete Auto Transit, Inc. v.Brady, 430 U. S. 274 (1977), treats a law as discriminatory ifit " `tax[es] a transaction or incident more heavily when itcrosses state lines than when it occurs entirely within theState.' " Chemical Waste Management, Inc. v. Hunt, 504U. S. 334, 342 (1992) (quoting Armco Inc. v. Hardesty, 467U. S. 638, 642 (1984)); see also Boston Stock Exchange v.State Tax Comm'n, 429 U. S. 318, 332, n. 12 (1977) (notingthat a State "may not discriminate between transactions onthe basis of some interstate element"). State laws discrimi-nating against interstate commerce on their face are "virtually per se invalid." Oregon Waste, supra, at 99; see alsoPhiladelphia v. New Jersey, 437 U. S. 617, 624 (1978).We have also recognized, however, that a facially discrimi-natory tax may still survive Commerce Clause scrutiny ifit is a truly " `compensatory tax' designed simply to makeinterstate commerce bear a burden already borne by intra-state commerce."Associated Industries, supra, at 647.22 We use the terms "compensatory" tax and "complementary" tax as twoways of describing the same phenomenon: a tax on interstate commerce"complements" a tax on intrastate commerce to the extent that it "compensates" for the burdens imposed on intrastate commerce by imposing asimilar burden on interstate commerce. We have also described taxes516us2$23m 10-22-98 12:42:45 PAGES OPINPGT332 FULTON CORP. v. FAULKNEROpinion of the CourtThus, in Henneford v. Silas Mason Co., 300 U. S. 577 (1937),we upheld the State of Washington's tax on the privilege ofusing any article of tangible personal property within theState. The statute exempted the use of any article that hadalready been subjected to a sales tax equal to the use tax orgreater, so that the use tax effectively applied only to goodspurchased out of state. Although the use tax was itself fa-cially discriminatory, we held that the combined effect of thesales and use taxes was to subject intrastate and interstatecommerce to equivalent burdens. " `There is no demand in. . . [the] Constitution that the State shall put its requirements in any one statute,' " we said; rather, " `[i]t may distribute them as it sees fit, if the result, taken in its totality,is within the State's constitutional power.' "Id., at 584(quoting Gregg Dyeing Co. v. Query, 286 U. S. 472, 480(1932)). As Justice Cardozo explained for the Court, thecomplementary arrangement assures that "[w]hen the ac-count is made up, the stranger from afar is subject to nogreater burdens as a consequence of ownership than thedweller within the gates. The one pays upon one activityor incident, and the other upon another, but the sum is thesame when the reckoning is closed." 300 U. S., at 584.SinceSilas Mason, our cases have distilled three conditions necessary for a valid compensatory tax. First, "aState must, as a threshold matter, `identif[y] . . . the [intrastate tax] burden for which the State is attempting to com-pensate.' "Oregon Waste, supra, at 103 (quoting Marylandv. Louisiana, 451 U. S. 725, 758 (1981)). Second, "the tax oninterstate commerce must be shown roughly to approximate--but not exceed--the amount of the tax on intrastateon interstate commerce as being imposed "in lieu" of taxes on intrastatecommerce. See, e. g., Railway Express Agency, Inc. v. Virginia, 358 U. S.434, 436 (1959); Postal Telegraph Cable Co. v. Adams, 155 U. S. 688, 700(1895). This last class of cases, however, has involved taxes which wereat least arguably not facially discriminatory, and we have evaluated thesecases under a somewhat different standard.516us2$23m 10-22-98 12:42:45 PAGES OPINPGT333Cite as: 516 U. S. 325 (1996)Opinion of the Courtcommerce." Oregon Waste, 511 U. S., at 103. "Finally, theevents on which the interstate and intrastate taxes are imposed must be `substantially equivalent'; that is, they mustbe sufficiently similar in substance to serve as mutually exclusive `prox[ies]' for each other." Ibid. (quoting Armco Inc.v.Hardesty, supra, at 643).IIIThere is no doubt that the intangibles tax facially discrimi-nates against interstate commerce. A regime that taxesstock only to the degree that its issuing corporation partici-pates in interstate commerce favors domestic corporationsover their foreign competitors in raising capital among NorthCarolina residents and tends, at least, to discourage domesticcorporations from plying their trades in interstate com-merce. The Secretary practically concedes as much, andrelies instead on the compensatory tax defense.3 The only3 Although the Secretary does suggest that the tax is so small in amountas to have no practical impact at all, we have never recognized a "deminimis" defense to a charge of discriminatory taxation under the Commerce Clause. See, e. g., Associated Industries of Mo. v. Lohman, 511U. S. 641, 650 (1994) ("[A]ctual discrimination, wherever it is found, isimpermissible, and the magnitude and scope of the discrimination haveno bearing on the determinative question whether discrimination has occurred"); Maryland v. Louisiana, 451 U. S. 725, 760 (1981) ("We need notknow how unequal the Tax is before concluding that it unconstitutionallydiscriminates"). We likewise reject the Secretary's speculation that themost likely effect, if any, of the taxable percentage deduction is to encourage out-of-state firms to compete in the North Carolina market so thattheir North Carolina shareholders may take advantage of the deduction.As we explain further, supra, at 330-331, such promotion of in-state markets at the expense of out-of-state ones furthers the "economic Balkanization" that our dormant Commerce Clause jurisprudence has long soughtto prevent. Hughes v. Oklahoma, 441 U. S. 322, 325-326 (1979); see alsoHalliburton Oil Well Cementing Co. v. Reily, 373 U. S. 64, 72 (1963) (aState may not impose "a tax which is discriminatory in favor of the localmerchant" so as to "encourag[e] an out-of-state operator to become a resident in order to compete on equal terms") (internal quotation marks andcitation omitted).516us2$23m 10-22-98 12:42:45 PAGES OPINPGT334 FULTON CORP. v. FAULKNEROpinion of the Courtissue, then, is whether the taxable percentage deduction canbe sustained as compensatory.AAs we have said, a State that invokes the compensatorytax defense must identify the intrastate tax for which itseeks to compensate, see supra, at 332, and it should go with-out saying that this intrastate tax must serve some purposefor which the State may otherwise impose a burden on inter-state commerce. InMaryland v. Louisiana, 451 U. S. 725(1981), for example, we rejected Louisiana's argument that,because it imposed a severance tax on natural resources ex-tracted from its own soil, it could impose a compensating"first use" tax on resources produced out of state but usedwithin Louisiana. Because "Louisiana has no sovereign interest in being compensated for the severance of resourcesfrom the federally owned [Outer Continental Shelf] land,"we held that "[t]he two events are not comparable in thesame fashion as a use tax complements a sales tax."Id.,at 759.In this case, the Secretary suggests that the intangiblestax, with its taxable percentage deduction, compensates forthe burden of the general corporate income tax paid by cor-porations doing business in North Carolina. But becauseNorth Carolina has no general sovereign interest in taxingincome earned out of state,Maryland v. Louisiana teachesthat the Secretary must identify some in-state activity orbenefit in order to justify the compensatory levy. Indeed,we have repeatedly held that "no state tax may be sustainedunless the tax . . . has a substantial nexus with the State . . .[and] is fairly related to the services provided by the State."Id., at 754; see also Jefferson Lines, 514 U. S., at 183-184;Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 U. S., at 279. TheSecretary does not disagree, but rather insists that NorthCarolina may impose a compensatory tax upon foreign corpo516us2$23m 10-22-98 12:42:45 PAGES OPINPGT335Cite as: 516 U. S. 325 (1996)Opinion of the Courtrations because they may avail themselves of access to NorthCarolina's capital markets.The Secretary's theory is that one of the services providedby the State, and supported through its general corporateincome tax, is the maintenance of a capital market for corporations wishing to sell stock to North Carolina residents.Since those corporations escape North Carolina's income taxto the extent those corporations do business in other States,the Secretary says, the State may require those companiesto pay for the privilege of access to the State's capital markets by a tax on the value of the shares sold. So, the Secretary concludes, the intangibles tax "rests squarely on `thesettled principle that interstate commerce may be made topay its way.' " Brief for Respondent 18 (quoting OregonWaste, 511 U. S., at 102).The argument is unconvincing, and we rejected a counterpart of it in Oregon Waste, where we held that Oregon couldnot charge an increased fee for disposal of waste generatedout of state on the theory that in-state waste generators supported the cost of waste disposal facilities through generalincome taxes. Although we relied primarily upon the conclusion that earning income and disposing of waste are not"substantially equivalent taxable events," id., at 105, we alsospoke of the danger of treating general revenue measures asrelevant intrastate burdens for purposes of the compensatory tax doctrine. "[P]ermitting discriminatory taxes on interstate commerce to compensate for charges purportedlyincluded in general forms of intrastate taxation would allowa state to tax interstate commerce more heavily than in-statecommerce anytime the entities involved in interstate commerce happened to use facilities supported by general statetax funds." Id., at 105, n. 8 (internal quotation marks andcitation omitted). We declined then, as we do now, "to opensuch an expansive loophole in our carefully confined compensatory tax jurisprudence." Ibid.516us2$23m 10-22-98 12:42:45 PAGES OPINPGT336 FULTON CORP. v. FAULKNEROpinion of the CourtEven shutting our eyes to that loophole, we are unper-suaded that North Carolina's corporate income tax is designed to support the maintenance of an intrastate capitalmarket. North Carolina, like most States, regulates accessto its capital markets by means of blue sky laws, see gener-ally N. C. Gen. Stat. ch. 78A (1994), and their accompanyingregulations, which prescribe who may sell securities inNorth Carolina, the procedures that must be followed todo so, and the fees imposed for the privilege. See,e. g.,N. C. Gen. Stat. $ 78A-28 (1994) (registration procedures andfees); 18 N. C. Admin. Code $ 6.1304 (1990) (same). Absentprobative evidence to the contrary, which the Secretary hasnot supplied, we can reasonably assume that North Carolinahas provided for the upkeep of its capital market throughthese provisions, not through the general corporate incometax.4If the corporate income tax does not support the maintenance of North Carolina's capital market, then the State hasnot justified imposition of a compensating levy on the owner-ship of shares in corporations not subject to the income tax.While we need not hold that a State may never justify acompensatory tax by an intrastate burden included in a general form of taxation, the linkage in this case between theintrastate burden and the benefit shared by out-of-staters isfar too tenuous to overcome the risk posed by recognizing ageneral levy as a complementary twin.BThe second prong of our analysis requires that "the tax oninterstate commerce . . . be shown roughly to approximate--but not exceed--the amount of the tax on intrastate com-merce."Oregon Waste, supra, at 103. The Secretary ar4 Our skepticism regarding the Secretary's capital markets argument isreinforced by the fact that the Secretary did not advance it to the statecourts.516us2$23m 10-22-98 12:42:45 PAGES OPINPGT337Cite as: 516 U. S. 325 (1996)Opinion of the Courtgues that the relative magnitudes of the corporate incometax and the intangibles tax can be evaluated best by reference to the price/earnings (P/E) ratios of taxpayer firms.This ratio represents the relationship of the value of a corporation's stock, the target of the intangibles tax, to the corporation's earnings, which are subjected to the income tax.See 3 New Palgrave Dictionary of Money & Finance 176(1992). North Carolina taxes corporate income and owner-ship of stock at rates of 7.75% and .25%, respectively. Giventhese rates, the State Supreme Court found that "a NorthCarolina corporation need only have a P/E ratio less than 31(7.75/.25) in order to have the tax against its income exceedthe intangibles tax against the stockholders of a comparablecorporation doing business only in [other States] and havingall its shareholders in North Carolina. Since P/E ratios areonly rarely greater than 31, most out-of-state corporationswill in fact be paying less taxes to North Carolina . . . thana similar North Carolina corporation." 338 N. C., at 480, 450S. E. 2d, at 733 (footnotes omitted).The math is fine, but even leaving aside the issue of whois really paying the taxes, the example compares apples tooranges. When a corporation doing business in a State paysits general corporate income tax, it pays for a wide rangeof things: construction and maintenance of a transportationnetwork, institutions that educate the work force, local policeand fire protection, and so on. The Secretary's justificationfor the intangibles tax, however, rests on only one of themany services funded by the corporate income tax, the maintenance of a capital market for the shares of both foreign anddomestic corporations. To the extent that corporations dotheir business outside North Carolina, after all, they get little else from the State. Even, then, if we suppressed oursuspicion that North Carolina actually funds its capital market through its blue sky fees, not its general corporate taxation, the relevant comparison for our analysis has to bebetween the size of the intangibles tax and that of the cor516us2$23m 10-22-98 12:42:45 PAGES OPINPGT338 FULTON CORP. v. FAULKNEROpinion of the Courtporate income taxes component that purportedly funds thecapital market.That comparison, of course, is for the present practicalpurpose impossible. The corporate income tax is a generalform of taxation, not assessed according to the taxpayer'suse of particular services, and before its revenues are earmarked for particular purposes they have been commingledwith funds from other sources. As a result, the Secretarycannot tell us what proportion of the corporate income taxgoes to support the capital market, or whether that proportion represents a burden greater than the one imposed oninterstate commerce by the intangibles tax. True, it is notinconceivable, however unlikely, that a capital markets com-ponent of the corporate income tax exceeds the intangiblestax in magnitude, but the Secretary cannot carry her burdenof demonstrating this on the record in front of us.This difficulty simply confirms our general unwillingnessto "permi[t] discriminatory taxes on interstate commerce tocompensate for charges purportedly included in generalforms of intrastate taxation."Oregon Waste, 511 U. S., at105, n. 8. Where general forms of taxation are involved, weordinarily cannot even begin to make the sorts of quanti-tative assessments that the compensatory tax doctrine requires. See infra, at 341-343.CThe tax, finally, fails even the third prong of compensatorytax analysis, which requires the compensating taxes to fallon substantially equivalent events. Although we found suchequivalence in the sales/use tax combination at issue inSilasMason, our more recent cases have shown extreme reluc-tance to recognize new compensatory categories. In OregonWaste, we even pointed out that "use taxes on products pur-chased out of state are the only taxes we have upheld inrecent memory under the compensatory tax doctrine." 511U. S., at 105. On the other hand, we have rejected equivalence arguments for pairing taxes upon the earning of in516us2$23m 10-22-98 12:42:45 PAGES OPINPGT339Cite as: 516 U. S. 325 (1996)Opinion of the Courtcome and the disposing of waste, ibid., the severance of natu-ral resources from the soil and the use of resources importedfrom other States, Maryland v. Louisiana, 451 U. S., at 759,and the manufacturing and wholesaling of tangible goods,Tyler Pipe Industries, Inc. v. Washington State Dept. ofRevenue, 483 U. S. 232, 244 (1987); Armco Inc. v. Hardesty,467 U. S., at 642. In each case, we held that the pairedactivities were not "sufficiently similar in substance to serveas mutually exclusive prox[ies] for each other." OregonWaste, supra, at 103 (internal quotation marks and citationomitted).In the face of this trend, the Secretary argues that NorthCarolina has assured substantial equivalence by employingthe same apportionment formula to tie the percentage ofshare value subject to the intangibles tax directly to the percentage of income earned within the State. See N. C. Gen.Stat. $ 105-130.4(i) (1992). The Secretary further contendsthat the intangibles tax and the corporate income tax fall onsubstantially equivalent "events" because they fall on economically equivalent "values": the value of a corporation'sstock and the value of a corporation's income, respectively.Even assuming the truth of both these assertions, however,we find that the intangibles tax is not functionally equivalentto the corporate income tax.By equivalence of value, the Secretary means that thevalue reached by the intangibles tax reflects that targetedby the income tax to a substantial degree because of theinfluence of corporate earnings on the price of stock. Whilethat may be true enough,5 it does not explain away the fact5 It is generally well accepted that corporate income will ordinarily bea good indicator of the stock's value. See, e. g., J. Weston & E. Brigham,Essentials of Managerial Finance 254-257 (10th ed. 1993). While theremay be cases in which other factors will play a more significant role, andwhile the past corporate earnings that the income tax reaches may be animperfect proxy for the anticipated future earnings upon which stock priceis actually based, we are willing to accept the Secretary's judgment thatthe taxed values correspond for purposes of this case.516us2$23m 10-22-98 12:42:45 PAGES OPINPGT340 FULTON CORP. v. FAULKNEROpinion of the Courtthat the taxes are apparently different (quite apart fromstated rates) in a number of obvious respects, including theparties ostensibly taxed. Something more than mere influ-ence of the one stated tax base on the value of the otherwould therefore be necessary before we could conclude thatequivalent events (or "values") are taxed. The nature ofthat something more flows from the objective of theequivalent-event requirement, which is to enable in-state andout-of-state businesses to compete on a footing of equality.In Silas Mason, for example, we observed that "[t]he practi-cal effect" of Washington's sales/use tax regime "must bethat retail sellers in Washington will be helped to competeupon terms of equality with retail dealers in other stateswho are exempt from a sales tax or any correspondingburden." 300 U. S., at 581; see also Halliburton Oil WellCementing Co. v. Reily, 373 U. S. 64, 70 (1963) ("[E]qualtreatment for in-state and out-of-state taxpayers similarlysituated is the condition precedent for a valid use tax ongoods imported from out-of-state"). This equality of treatment does not appear when the allegedly compensating taxesfall respectively on taxpayers who are differently described,as, for example, resident shareholders and corporationsdoing business out of state. A State defending such ascheme as one of complementary taxation, therefore, has theburden of showing that the actual incidences of the two taxburdens are different enough from their nominal incidencesso that the real taxpayers are within the same class, andthat therefore a finding of combined neutrality on interstatecompetition would at least be possible.66 Silas Mason makes clear that actual incidence upon the same class oftaxpayers is a necessary condition for a finding that two taxes are complementary. Our analysis has sometimes focused upon other factors, however, see, e. g., Armco Inc. v. Hardesty, 467 U. S. 638, 643 (1984), and weneed not decide today whether identity of tax incidence is sufficient tocompel the conclusion that two taxes fall upon substantially equivalentevents.516us2$23m 10-22-98 12:42:45 PAGES OPINPGT341Cite as: 516 U. S. 325 (1996)Opinion of the CourtIn principle, the door may be open for such an argument.It is well established that "the ultimate distribution of theburden of taxes [may] be quite different from the distributionof statutory liability," McLure, Incidence Analysis and theSupreme Court: An Examination of Four Cases from the1980 Term, 1 Sup. Ct. Econ. Rev. 69, 72 (1982), with suchdivergence occurring when the nominal taxpayer can pass itthrough to other parties, like consumers. The Secretary'sequivalence argument might work in the present case, then,if we could find that the economic impact of North Carolina'scorporate income tax is passed through to shareholders ofcorporations doing business in state in a way that offsets thedisincentive imposed by the intangibles tax to buying stockin corporations doing business out of state.But there is a problem with this line of argument, and itlies in the frequently extreme complexity of economic incidence analysis. The actual incidence of a tax may dependon elasticities of supply and demand, the ability of producersand consumers to substitute one product for another, thestructure of the relevant market, the timeframe over whichthe tax is imposed and evaluated, and so on. See, e. g., Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Montana, 453 U. S. 609, 619, n. 8(1981) (determining "whether the tax burden is shifted outof State, rather than borne by in-state producers and con-sumers, would require complex factual inquiries about suchissues as elasticity of demand for the product and alterna-tive sources of supply").7 We declined to shoulder any suchanalysis in Minneapolis Star & Tribune Co. v. Minnesota7 Other factors may also be important, depending on the particular case.These include "whether (1) the taxed product is a final or intermediategood, (2) the tax is large or small, (3) prices are rising or falling, (4) thecosts of the taxed enterprise are increasing or decreasing, (5) the factorsof production are mobile, (6) the taxed industry is subject to governmentregulation, and (7) in the federal system, the state imposing the tax dominates the market for the taxed good or service." Hellerstein, Complementary Taxes as a Defense to Unconstitutional State Tax Discrimination,39 Tax Lawyer 405, 439 (1986).516us2$23m 10-22-98 12:42:45 PAGES OPINPGT342 FULTON CORP. v. FAULKNEROpinion of the CourtComm'r of Revenue, 460 U. S. 575, 589-590, and nn. 12-14(1983), noting that "courts as institutions are poorlyequipped to evaluate with precision the relative burdens ofvarious methods of taxation. The complexities of factualeconomic proof always present a certain potential for error,and courts have little familiarity with the process of evaluating the relative economic burden of taxes" (footnote omitted).We were likewise unwilling to "plunge . . . into the morassof weighing comparative tax burdens by comparing taxes ondissimilar events" in Oregon Waste. 511 U. S., at 105 (internal quotation marks omitted). Indeed, the general difficultyof comparing the economic incidence of state taxes paid bydifferent taxpayers upon different transactions goes a longway toward explaining why we have so seldom recognized avalid compensatory tax outside the context of sales and usetaxes.8 See Hellerstein, Complementary Taxes as a Defenseto Unconstitutional State Tax Discrimination, 39 Tax Law8 The only exception of which we are aware is Hinson v. Lott, 8 Wall.148 (1869). In that case, we upheld an Alabama tax on each gallon ofliquor imported into the State on the ground that it complemented a taxof equal magnitude on each gallon of liquor distilled in the State. Wenoted that this tax scheme was "necessary to make the tax equal on allliquors sold in the State," id., at 153, a rationale consistent with our conclusion that the compensatory tax doctrine is fundamentally concerned withequalizing competition between in-staters and out-of-staters. Indeed, wecited Hinson in support of a similar proposition in Silas Mason. SeeHenneford v. Silas Mason, 300 U. S. 577, 585 (1937). In determining thata tax on importers and distillers would actually equalize competition inthe liquor market, the Hinson Court made a good commonsense estimateof the likely incidence of the two taxes. Simply because modern economictools may indicate that the incidence question is more complex, moreover,does not undermine the basic principle of equal competition established inHinson. By the same token, however, Hinson does not alter our conclusion today that courts will ordinarily be unable to evaluate the economicequivalence of allegedly complementary tax schemes that go beyond traditional sales/use taxes. See supra, at 337-338, this page and 343. Somuch for Hinson in theory; for Hinson in practice, compare it withArmco, supra.516us2$23m 10-22-98 12:42:45 PAGES OPINPGT343Cite as: 516 U.

Because corporations operating in North Carolina do not exhaust the marketfor investment opportunities, investors are free to look elsewhere if North Carolina's corporate income tax has the effectof depressing the value of shares in corporations doing business in the State. Hence, the impact of the income tax willbe reflected in the purchase price of these shares, investorswill presumably earn a market return on a lower outlay, andthe actual burden of the tax will be borne by other parties,such as the consumers of the corporations' products. SeeMcClure, supra, at 82; see also McClure, The Elusive Incidence of the Corporate Income Tax: The State Case, 9 Pub.Finance Q. 395, 401 (1981). But because North Carolina investors make up a relatively small proportion of the participants in national capital markets, it is unlikely that the stockprice of corporations doing business outside the State willreflect the impact of the intangibles tax. The economic incidence of this tax is thus likely to fall squarely on the shareholder. All other things being equal, then, a North Carolinainvestor will probably favor investment in corporationsdoing business within the State, and the intangibles tax willhave worked an impermissible result. See Halliburton, 373U. S., at 72 (States may not impose discriminatory taxes oninterstate commerce in the hopes of encouraging firms to dobusiness within the State); Dean Milk Co. v. Madison, 340U. S. 349, 356 (1951) (observing that the creation of "preferential trade areas" is "destructive of the very purpose of theCommerce Clause").516us2$23m 10-22-98 12:42:45 PAGES OPINPGT344 FULTON CORP. v. FAULKNEROpinion of the CourtAll other things, of course, are rarely equal, and investorsmay wish to invest in corporations doing business in NorthCarolina for any number of reasons, perhaps affecting thedegree to which the corporate income tax is or is not passedthrough to shareholders. Our point, however, is simply thatthere are reasons to doubt the Secretary's contention thatthe corporate income tax amounts to a clear equivalent forthe burden on shareholding imposed by the intangibles tax,and these doubts are dispositive. After all, "the concept ofthe compensatory tax . . . is merely a specific way of justifying a facially discriminatory tax as achieving a legitimatelocal purpose that cannot be achieved through nondiscriminatory means." Oregon Waste, supra, at 102. As with anyother defense of a facially discriminatory tax, the State hasthe burden to show that the requirements of the compen-satory tax doctrine are clearly met. Cf. Chemical WasteManagement, Inc. v. Hunt, 504 U. S., at 342-343 (noting that" `facial discrimination invokes the strictest scrutiny of anypurported legitimate local purpose' ") (quoting Hughes v.Oklahoma, 441 U. S. 322, 337 (1979)). While we doubt thatsuch a showing can ever be made outside the limited confinesof sales and use taxes, it is enough to say here that no suchshowing has been made.IVOur finding that North Carolina has failed to show that itsintangibles tax satisfies any of the three requirements fora valid compensatory tax leaves the tax unconstitutional asfacially discriminatory under our modern tests. The Secretary argues, however, that our decision in Darnell v. Indiana, 226 U. S. 390 (1912), compels us to sustain the NorthCarolina statute. The statutory scheme at issue inDarnelltaxed all shares in foreign corporations owned by Indianaresidents as well as all shares in domestic corporations tothe extent that the issuing corporations' property was notsubject to Indiana's general property tax. Writing for theCourt, Justice Holmes found that "[t]he only difference of516us2$23m 10-22-98 12:42:45 PAGES OPINPGT345Cite as: 516 U. S. 325 (1996)Opinion of the Courttreatment . . . that concerns the defendants is that the Statetaxes the property of domestic corporations and the stock offoreign ones in similar cases." Id., at 398. This arrange-ment, he concluded, "is consistent with substantial equalitynotwithstanding the technical differences." Ibid.9Justice Holmes has been praised for the lucidity of his reasoning, as having been "wrong clearly" even where he erred,see Hart, Positivism and the Separation of Law and Morals,71 Harv. L. Rev. 593 (1958), but the opinion in Darnell doesnot exemplify his customary merit. He gives no explanationfor the conclusion quoted, commenting only that the discrimi-nation issue "was decided inKidd v. Alabama, 188 U. S. 730,732 [(1903)]." 226 U. S., at 398. Kidd, however, was decided under the Equal Protection Clause of the FourteenthAmendment and emphasized "the large latitude allowed tothe States for classification upon any reasonable basis." 188U. S., at 733 (citations omitted). The exclusive reliance uponKidd in Darnell thus indicates that the latter case should beviewed primarily as one of equal protection, despite the factthat Indiana's shareholder tax was challenged under both theEqual Protection and Commerce Clauses.To the extent that Darnell evaluated a discriminatorystate tax under the Equal Protection Clause, time simplyhas passed it by. While we continue to measure the equalprotection of economic legislation by a "rational basis" test,see, e. g., FCC v. Beach Communications, Inc., 508 U. S. 307,313 (1993), we now understand the dormant CommerceClause to require "justifications for discriminatory restric-tions on commerce [to] pass the `strictest scrutiny.' "Ore-gon Waste, 511 U. S., at 101 (quoting Hughes v. Oklahoma,supra, at 337); see also Chemical Waste Management, Inc.9 The Court did recognize as problematic the Indiana statute's failure toexempt shares of foreign corporations to the extent that those corporations owned, and were taxed upon, property within the State. JusticeHolmes noted, however, that the petitioners lacked standing to raise thatclaim. 226 U. S., at 398.516us2$23m 10-22-98 12:42:45 PAGES OPINPGT346 FULTON CORP. v. FAULKNEROpinion of the Courtv. Hunt, supra, at 342-343; Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 437U. S. 617, 624 (1978).10 Hence, while cases like Kidd andDarnell may still be authorities under the Equal ProtectionClause, they are no longer good law under the CommerceClause. Cf. Associated Industries of Mo. v. Lohman, 511U. S., at 652 (holding that, although a prior case applied amore lenient equal protection analysis to a Commerce Clausechallenge, it had been "bypassed by later decisions"). NorthCarolina's intangibles tax cannot pass muster under moderncompensatory tax cases, andDarnell cannot save it.VNorth Carolina's intangibles tax facially discriminatesagainst interstate commerce, it fails justification as a validcompensatory tax, and, accordingly, it cannot stand. At thesame time, of course, it is true that "a State found to haveimposed an impermissibly discriminatory tax retains flexi-bility in responding to this determination." McKessonCorp. v. Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco, Fla.Dept. of Business Regulation, 496 U. S. 18, 39-40 (1990). InMcKesson, for example, we said that a State might refundthe additional taxes imposed upon the victims of its discrimi-nation or, to the extent consistent with other constitutionalprovisions (notably due process), retroactively impose equalburdens on the tax's former beneficiaries. A State may alsocombine these two approaches. Ibid. These options areavailable because the Constitution requires only that "theresultant tax actually assessed during the contested tax10 Cf., e. g., Allied Stores of Ohio, Inc. v. Bowers, 358 U. S. 522, 528 (1959)("[I]t has long been settled that a [tax] classification, though discriminatory, is not . . . violative of the Equal Protection Clause . . . if any state offacts reasonably can be conceived that would sustain it"). One commentator has observed that, "[b]ecause the states enjoy extremely broad leewayunder the equal protection clause in drawing lines for tax purposes, theynormally have no need to defend a discriminatory tax classification onthe ground that a `complementary' levy is imposed on other taxpayers."Hellerstein, 39 Tax Lawyer, at 428 (footnote omitted).516us2$23m 10-22-98 12:42:45 PAGES OPINPGT347Cite as: 516 U.

Id., at 41.11In this case, that choice may well be dictated by the sever-ability clause enacted as part of the intangibles tax statute.N. C. Gen. Stat. $ 105-215 (1992). That issue, however, aswell as the question whether Fulton has properly compliedwith the procedural requirements of North Carolina's tax re-fund statute, $ 105-267, ought to come before the state courtsin the first instance. Cf. Swanson v. State, 335 N. C. 674,680-681, 441 S. E. 2d 537, 541 (noting that "[f]ailure to comply with the requirements in section 105-267 bars a taxpay-er's action against the State for a refund of taxes"), cert.denied, 513 U. S. 1056 (1994).12 Where "the federal constitu-tional issues involved [in the remedial determination] maywell be intertwined with, or their consideration obviated by,issues of state law," our practice is to leave the remedy forthe state supreme court to fashion on remand. Bacchus Imports, Ltd. v. Dias, 468 U. S. 263, 277 (1984); see also TylerPipe Industries v. Dept. of Revenue, 483 U. S., at 252;Williams v. Vermont, 472 U. S. 14, 28 (1985). We do thathere.The judgment of the North Carolina Supreme Court isreversed, and the case is remanded for proceedings notinconsistent with this opinion.
