We granted certiorari in this case to consider whether aprisoner whose conviction became final before our decisionin Espinosa v. Florida, 505 U. S. 1079 (1992) (per curiam),is foreclosed from relying on that decision in a federal habeascorpus proceeding because it announced a "new rule" asdefined in Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989).IOn February 5, 1983, Cary Michael Lambrix and his girl-friend, Frances Smith, met Clarence Moore and AleishaBryant at a local tavern. The two couples returned to Lam-brix's trailer for dinner, where Lambrix killed Moore andBryant in brutal fashion. Lambrix was convicted on twocounts of first-degree murder. In the sentencing phase oftrial, the jury rendered an advisory verdict recommending*Kent S.

S. 518 (1997)Opinion of the Courtthat the trial court sentence Lambrix to death on bothcounts. The trial court, after finding five aggravating circumstances in connection with the murder of Moore, fouraggravating circumstances in connection with the murder ofBryant, and no mitigating circumstances as to either murder,sentenced Lambrix to death on both counts. Lambrix's con-viction and sentence were upheld on direct appeal by theFlorida Supreme Court. Lambrix v. State, 494 So. 2d 1143(1986).After the Florida courts denied his repeated efforts to ob-tain collateral relief,Lambrix v. Dugger, 529 So. 2d 1110(Fla. 1988); Lambrix v. State, 534 So. 2d 1151 (Fla. 1988);Lambrix v. State, 559 So. 2d 1137 (Fla. 1990), Lambrix fileda petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U. S. C.$ 2254 in the United States District Court for the SouthernDistrict of Florida; that court rejected all of his claims.While Lambrix's appeal was pending before the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, this Court decided Espinosav. Florida, supra, which held that if the sentencing judgein a "weighing" State (i. e., a State that requires specifiedaggravating circumstances to be weighed against any mitigating circumstances at the sentencing phase of a capitaltrial) is required to give deference to a jury's advisory sentencing recommendation, then neither the jury nor the judgeis constitutionally permitted to weigh invalid aggravatingcircumstances. Since Florida is such a State, and sinceone of Lambrix's claims was that his sentencing jury wasimproperly instructed on the "especially heinous, atrocious,or cruel" (HAC) aggravator, Espinosa had obvious relevanceto his habeas petition. Rather than address this issue inthe first instance, however, the Eleventh Circuit held itsproceedings in abeyance to permit Lambrix to present hisEspinosa claim to the Florida state courts.The Florida Supreme Court rejected Lambrix's Espinosaclaim without considering its merits on the ground that theclaim was procedurally barred. Lambrix v. Singletary, 641520US2 Unit: $U52 [09-10-99 19:18:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN522 LAMBRIX v. SINGLETARYOpinion of the CourtSo. 2d 847 (1994). That court explained that although Lam-brix had properly preserved his Espinosa objection at trialby requesting a limiting instruction on the HAC aggravator,he had failed to raise the issue on direct appeal. 641 So. 2d,at 848. The Florida Supreme Court also rejected Lambrix'sclaim that the procedural bar should be excused because hisappellate counsel was ineffective in failing to raise the for-feited issue, explaining that this claim was itself procedurallybarred and was, in any event, meritless. Id., at 848-849.After the Florida Supreme Court entered judgmentagainst Lambrix, the Eleventh Circuit adjudicated his ha-beas petition. Without even acknowledging the proceduralbar--which was expressly raised and argued by the State--the Court of Appeals proceeded to address the Espinosaclaim, and determined that Espinosa announced a new rulewhich cannot be applied retroactively on federal habeasunder Teague v. Lane, supra. 72 F. 3d 1500, 1503 (1996).We granted certiorari. 519 U. S. 958 (1996).IIBefore turning to the question presented in this case, wepause to consider the State's contention that Lambrix's Espinosa claim is procedurally barred because he failed to con-tend that the jury was instructed with a vague HAC aggravator on his direct appeal to the Florida Supreme Court.According to the State, the Florida Supreme Court "has consistently required that an Espinosa issue must have beenobjected to at trial and pursued on direct appeal in order tobe reviewed in postconviction proceedings."

S. 518 (1997)Opinion of the Courtrests on a state law ground that is independent of the federalquestion and adequate to support the judgment." See alsoHarris v. Reed, 489 U. S. 255, 262 (1989). We in fact lackjurisdiction to review such independently supported judgments on direct appeal: Since the state-law determinationis sufficient to sustain the decree, any opinion of this Courton the federal question would be purely advisory. Herb v.Pitcairn, 324 U. S. 117, 125-126 (1945); see also Sochor v.Florida, 504 U. S. 527, 533-534, and n. (1992). The "independent and adequate state ground" doctrine is not technically jurisdictional when a federal court considers a stateprisoner's petition for habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U. S. C.$ 2254, since the federal court is not formally reviewing ajudgment, but is determining whether the prisoner is "incustody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treatiesof the United States." We have nonetheless held that thedoctrine applies to bar consideration on federal habeas offederal claims that have been defaulted under state law.Coleman, supra, at 729-730, 750; see also Wainwright v.Sykes, 433 U. S. 72, 81, 82 (1977), discussing Brown v. Allen,344 U. S. 443, 486-487 (1953), and Ex parte Spencer, 228 U. S.652 (1913); Harris, supra, at 262.Application of the "independent and adequate stateground" doctrine to federal habeas review is based uponequitable considerations of federalism and comity. It "ensures that the States' interest in correcting their own mistakes is respected in all federal habeas cases." Coleman,501 U. S., at 732. "[A] habeas petitioner who has failed tomeet the State's procedural requirements for presenting hisfederal claims has deprived the state courts of an opportunity to address those claims in the first instance." Ibid. Ifthe "independent and adequate state ground" doctrine werenot applied, a federal district court or court of appeals wouldbe able to review claims that this Court would have beenunable to consider on direct review.

SINGLETARYOpinion of the CourtWe have never had occasion to consider whether a federalcourt should resolve a State's contention that a petitioner'sclaim is procedurally barred before considering whether hisclaim is Teague barred. Our opinions, however--most particularly, Coleman--certainly suggest that the proceduralbar issue should ordinarily be considered first. It was speculated at oral argument that the Court of Appeals may haveresolved the Teague issue without first considering procedural bar because our opinions have stated that the Teagueretroactivity decision is to be made as a "threshold matter."E. g., Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302, 329 (1989); Caspari v.Bohlen, 510 U. S. 383, 389 (1994). That simply means, however, that the Teague issue should be addressed "before considering the merits of [a] claim." 510 U. S., at 389. It doesnot mean that the Teague inquiry is antecedent to consideration of the general prerequisites for federal habeas corpuswhich are unrelated to the merits of the particular claim--such as the requirement that the petitioner be "in custody,"see 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(a), or that the state-court judgmentnot be based on an independent and adequate state ground.Constitutional issues are generally to be avoided, and aseven a cursory review of this Court's new-rule cases reveals(including our discussion in Part IV, infra), the Teague inquiry requires a detailed analysis of federal constitutionallaw. See, e. g., Sawyer v. Smith, 497 U. S. 227, 233-241(1990); Penry, supra, at 316-319; Gilmore v. Taylor, 508 U. S.333, 339-344 (1993); Saffle v. Parks, 494 U. S. 484, 488-494(1990).We are somewhat puzzled that the Eleventh Circuit, afterhaving held proceedings in abeyance while petitionerbrought his claim in state court, did not so much as mentionthe Florida Supreme Court's determination that Lambrix'sEspinosa claim was procedurally barred. The State of Florida raised that point before both the District Court and theCourt of Appeals, going so far as to reiterate it in a postjudg520US2 Unit: $U52 [09-10-99 19:18:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN525Cite as: 520 U. S. 518 (1997)Opinion of the Courtment Motion for Clarification and/or Modification of Opinionbefore the Court of Appeals, reprinted at App. 176. AState's procedural rules are of vital importance to the or-derly administration of its criminal courts; when a federalcourt permits them to be readily evaded, it undermines thecriminal justice system. We do not mean to suggest thatthe procedural-bar issue must invariably be resolved first;only that it ordinarily should be. Judicial economy mightcounsel giving the Teague question priority, for example, ifit were easily resolvable against the habeas petitioner,whereas the procedural-bar issue involved complicated issuesof state law. Cf. 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(b)(2) (permitting a federalcourt to deny a habeas petition on the merits notwithstand-ing the applicant's failure to exhaust state remedies).Despite our puzzlement at the Court of Appeals' failure toresolve this case on the basis of procedural bar, we hesitateto resolve it on that basis ourselves. Lambrix asserts sev-eral reasons why his claim is not procedurally barred, whichseem to us insubstantial but may not be so; as we have re-peatedly recognized, the courts of appeals and district courtsare more familiar than we with the procedural practices ofthe States in which they regularly sit, see,e. g., Rummel v.Estelle, 445 U. S. 263, 267, n. 7 (1980); County Court of UlsterCty. v. Allen, 442 U. S. 140, 153-154 (1979). Rather thanprolong this litigation by a remand, we proceed to decide thecase on the Teague grounds that the Court of Appeals used.IIIFlorida employs a three-stage sentencing procedure.First, the jury weighs statutorily specified aggravatingcircumstances against any mitigating circumstances, andrenders an "advisory sentence" of either life imprisonmentor death. Fla. Stat. $ 921.141(2) (Supp. 1992). Second, thetrial court weighs the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, and enters a sentence of life imprisonment or death;520US2 Unit: $U52 [09-10-99 19:18:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN526 LAMBRIX v. SINGLETARYOpinion of the Courtif the latter, its findings must be set forth in writing.$ 921.141(3). The jury's advisory sentence is entitled to"great weight" in the trial court's determination, Tedder v.State, 322 So. 2d 908, 910 (Fla. 1975), but the court has anindependent obligation to determine the appropriate punishment, Ross v. State, 386 So. 2d 1191, 1197 (Fla. 1980). Third,the Florida Supreme Court automatically reviews all casesin which the defendant is sentenced to death. $ 921.141(4).Lambrix's jury, which was instructed on five aggravatingcircumstances, recommended that he be sentenced to deathfor each murder. The trial court found five aggravating circumstances as to Moore's murder and four as to Bryant's,including that each murder was "especially heinous and atrocious"; it found no mitigating circumstances as to either murder; it concluded that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating, and sentenced Lambrix to death oneach count. App. 20-21. Although Lambrix failed to raiseany claims concerning the sentencing procedure on direct appeal, the Florida Supreme Court agreed with the trial court'sfindings as to the aggravating circumstances. Lambrix v.State, 494 So. 2d, at 1148.Lambrix contends that the jury's consideration of the HACaggravator violated the Eighth Amendment because the juryinstructions concerning this circumstance failed to providesufficient guidance to limit the jury's discretion. Like theEleventh Circuit, see 72 F. 3d, at 1503, we assume, arguendo,that this was so. Lambrix further contends (and this is atthe heart of the present case) that the trial court's independent weighing did not cure this error. Prior to our opinionin Espinosa v. Florida, 505 U. S. 1079 (1992), the State hadcontended that Lambrix was not entitled to relief becausethe sentencing judge properly found and weighed a narrowedHAC aggravator. In Espinosa, however, we established theprinciple that if a "weighing" State requires the sentencingtrial judge to give deference to a jury's advisory recommendation, neither the judge nor the jury is constitutionally per520US2 Unit: $U52 [09-10-99 19:18:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN527Cite as: 520 U. S. 518 (1997)Opinion of the Courtmitted to weigh invalid aggravating circumstances. Lam-brix seeks the benefit of that principle; the State contendsthat it constitutes a new rule under Teague and thus cannotbe relied on in a federal habeas corpus proceeding.1In Teague we held that, in general, "new constitutionalrules of criminal procedure will not be applicable to thosecases which have become final before the new rules are an-nounced." 489 U. S., at 310-311. To applyTeague, a fed-eral court engages in a three-step process. First, it determines the date upon which the defendant's conviction becamefinal. See Caspari v. Bohlen, 510 U. S., at 390. Second, itmust " `[s]urve[y] the legal landscape as it then existed,' Gra-ham v. Collins, [506 U. S. 461, 468 (1993)], and `determinewhether a state court considering [the defendant's] claimat the time his conviction became final would have feltcompelled by existing precedent to conclude that the rule[he] seeks was required by the Constitution,'Saffle v. Parks,494 U. S. 484, 488 (1990)." Ibid. Finally, if the court determines that the habeas petitioner seeks the benefit of a newrule, the court must consider whether the relief sought fallswithin one of the two narrow exceptions to nonretroactivity.SeeGilmore v. Taylor, 508 U. S., at 345.IVLambrix's conviction became final on November 24, 1986,when his time for filing a petition for certiorari expired.Thus, our first and principal task is to survey the legallandscape as of that date, to determine whether the rulelater announced in Espinosa was dictated by then-existingprecedent--whether, that is, the unlawfulness of Lambrix's1 Lambrix also contends that the trial court itself failed to apply a properly narrowed HAC aggravator. We decline to consider this contentionbecause it is not fairly within the question presented, which asked onlywhether Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989), bars relief based upon Espinosa v. Florida, 505 U. S. 1079 (1992) (per curiam), Pet. for Cert. i.See this Court's Rule 14.1(a).520US2 Unit: $U52 [09-10-99 19:18:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN528 LAMBRIX v. SINGLETARYOpinion of the Courtconviction was apparent to all reasonable jurists. See, e. g.,Graham v. Collins, 506 U. S. 461, 477 (1993); Butler v. McKellar, 494 U. S. 407, 415 (1990); id., at 417-418 (Brennan,J., dissenting).In Espinosa, we determined that the Florida capital juryis, in an important respect, a cosentencer with the judge.As we explained: "Florida has essentially split the weighingprocess in two. Initially, the jury weighs aggravating andmitigating circumstances, and the result of that weighingprocess is then in turn weighed within the trial court's process of weighing aggravating and mitigating circumstances."505 U. S., at 1082. We then concluded that the jury's consideration of a vague aggravator tainted the trial court's sen-tence because the trial court gave deference to the jury verdict (and thus indirectly weighed the vague aggravator) inthe course of weighing the aggravating and mitigating circumstances. Ibid. We reasoned that this indirect weigh-ing created the same risk of arbitrariness as the directweighing of an invalid aggravating factor. Ibid.2In our view, Espinosa was not dictated by precedent, butannounced a new rule which cannot be used as the basis forfederal habeas corpus relief. It is significant that Espinosaitself did not purport to rely upon any controlling precedent.32 Our description of the holding of Espinosa in the preceding paragraphof text is so clear that we are at a loss to explain Justice Stevens'simpression that we accord Espinosa the "novel interpretation" that "theconstitutional error in the jury instruction will `automatically render adefendant's sentence unconstitutional.' " Post, at 541 (dissenting opinion)(quoting infra, at 530). The sentence from which the phrase quoted byJustice Stevens is wrenched (so violently that the word "not" whichprecedes it is omitted) is not discussing the holding of Espinosa; indeed,it does not even mention Espinosa; nor does the entire paragraph or theprevious or subsequent paragraphs.3 Justice Stevens maintains that this statement is proved wrong byEspinosa's citation of Godfrey v. Georgia, 446 U. S. 420 (1980), and Tedderv. State, 322 So. 2d 908 (Fla. 1975). Post, at 541, n. 2. This is wordplay.While those two cases can be called "controlling authority" in the sensethat the two propositions they established (that an instruction to the520US2 Unit: $U52 [09-10-99 19:18:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN529Cite as: 520 U. S. 518 (1997)Opinion of the CourtThe opinion cited only a single case, Baldwin v. Alabama,472 U. S. 372, 382 (1985), in support of its central conclusionthat indirect weighing of an invalid aggravator "creates thesame potential for arbitrariness" as direct weighing of aninvalid aggravator. Espinosa, 505 U. S., at 1082. And it in-troduced that lone citation with a "cf."--an introductory signal which shows authority that supports the point in dictumor by analogy, not one that "controls" or "dictates" the result.Baldwin itself contains further evidence that Espinosa setforth a new rule.Baldwin considered the constitutionalityof Alabama's death sentencing scheme, in which the jury wasrequired to "fix the punishment at death" if it found the de-fendant guilty of an aggravated offense, whereupon the trialcourt would conduct a sentencing hearing at which it woulddetermine a sentence of death or of life imprisonment. 472U. S., at 376. The defendant contended that because thejury's mandatory sentence would have been unconstitutionalstanding alone, see Woodson v. North Carolina, 428 U. S.280, 288-305 (1976) (plurality opinion), it was impermissiblefor the trial court to consider that verdict in determining itsown sentence. We did not reach that contention because weconcluded that under Alabama law the jury's verdict formedno part of the trial judge's sentencing calculus. Id., at 382.We noted, however, on the page of the opinion that Espinosacited, that the defendant's "argument conceivably mighthave merit if the judge actually were required to considerthe jury's `sentence' as a recommendation as to the sentencethe jury believed would be appropriate, cf. Proffitt v. Florsentencing jury which fails to define the HAC aggravator violates theEighth Amendment, and that the Florida sentencing judge must givegreat weight to the jury's recommendation) were among the "givens" fromwhich any decision in Espinosa had to be derived, they assuredly werenot "controlling authority" in the sense we obviously intend: that theycompel the outcome in Espinosa. They do not answer the definitive question: whether the jury's advisory verdict taints the trial court's sentence,that is, whether indirect weighing of an invalid factor creates the samepotential for arbitrariness as direct weighing.520US2 Unit: $U52 [09-10-99 19:18:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN530 LAMBRIX v. SINGLETARYOpinion of the Courtida, 428 U. S. 242 (1976), and if the judge were obligatedto accord some deference to it."Baldwin, 472 U. S., at 382(emphasis added); see also id., at 386, n. 8 ("express[ing] noview" on the same point). This highly tentative expression,far from showing that Baldwin "dictate[s]" the result inEspinosa, see Sawyer v. Smith, 497 U. S., at 235, suggestsjust the opposite. Indeed, inBaldwin the Chief Justice,who believed that Alabama's scheme did contemplate thatthe trial judge would consider the jury's "sentence," nonetheless held the scheme constitutional. 472 U. S., at 392(opinion concurring in judgment).The Supreme Court decisions relied upon most heavily bypetitioner are Godfrey v. Georgia, 446 U. S. 420 (1980); Maynard v. Cartwright, 486 U. S. 356 (1988); and Clemons v. Mississippi, 494 U. S. 738 (1990). In Godfrey, we held thatGeorgia's "outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible and inhuman" aggravator was impermissibly vague, reasoning thatthere was nothing in the words "outrageously or wantonlyvile, horrible and inhuman" "that implies any inherent restraint on the arbitrary and capricious infliction of the deathsentence," and concluded that these terms alone "gave thejury no guidance." 446 U. S., at 428-429 (plurality opinion).Similarly, in Maynard v. Cartwright, applied retroactively toFebruary 1985 in Stringer v. Black, 503 U. S. 222 (1992), weheld that Oklahoma's HAC aggravator, which is identicallyworded to Florida's HAC aggravator, was impermissiblyvague because the statute gave no more guidance than thevague aggravator at issue in Godfrey and the sentencing jurywas not given a limiting instruction. 486 U. S., at 363-364.Although Godfrey and Maynard support the propositionthat vague aggravators must be sufficiently narrowed toavoid arbitrary imposition of the death penalty, these cases,and others, demonstrate that the failure to instruct the sentencing jury properly with respect to the aggravator doesnot automatically render a defendant's sentence unconstitutional. We have repeatedly indicated that a sentencing520US2 Unit: $U52 [09-10-99 19:18:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN531Cite as: 520 U. S. 518 (1997)Opinion of the Courtjury's consideration of a vague aggravator can be cured byappellate review. Thus, inGodfrey itself, we were less concerned about the failure to instruct the jury properly thanwe were about the Georgia Supreme Court's failure to narrow the facially vague aggravator on appeal. Had the Georgia Supreme Court applied a narrowing construction of theaggravator, we would have rejected the Eighth Amendmentchallenge to Godfrey's death sentence, notwithstanding thefailure to instruct the jury on that narrowing construction.Godfrey, supra, at 431-432. Likewise in Maynard, westressed that the vague HAC aggravator had not been sufficiently limited on appeal by the Oklahoma Court of CriminalAppeals "to cure the unfettered discretion of the jury." 486U. S., at 364.We reached a similar conclusion in Clemons v. Mississippi,applied retroactively to February 1985 in Stringer. Clemons considered the question whether the sentencer's weighing of a vague HAC aggravator rendered that sentence unconstitutional in a "weighing" State. The sentencing juryin Clemons, as in Maynard, was given a HAC instructionthat was unconstitutionally vague. We held that "the Federal Constitution does not prevent a state appellate courtfrom upholding a death sentence that is based in part onan invalid or improperly defined aggravating circumstanceeither by reweighing of the aggravating and mitigatingevidence or by harmless-error review." Clemons, supra,at 741, 745; see also Stringer, supra, at 230.The principles of the above-described cases do not dictatethe result we ultimately reached in Espinosa. Florida, unlike Oklahoma, see Maynard, supra, at 360, had given itsfacially vague HAC aggravator a limiting construction sufficient to satisfy the Constitution. See Proffitt v. Florida,428 U. S., at 255-256 ( joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, andStevens, JJ.); id., at 260 (White, J., concurring in judgment).Thus, unlike the sentencing juries in Clemons, Maynard,and Godfrey, who were not instructed with a properly lim520US2 Unit: $U52 [09-10-99 19:18:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN532 LAMBRIX v. SINGLETARYOpinion of the Courtited aggravator, the sentencing trial judge in Espinosa didfind the HAC aggravator under a properly limited construction. See Espinosa, 505 U. S., at 1082, citing Walton v. Arizona, 497 U. S. 639, 653 (1990).4 A close examination of theFlorida death penalty scheme persuades us that a reasonablejurist considering Lambrix's sentence in 1986 could havereached a conclusion different from the one Espinosa announced in 1992. There were at least three different, butsomewhat related, approaches that would have suggested adifferent outcome:(1)The mere cabining of the trial court's discretionwould avoid arbitrary imposition of the death penalty, andthus avoid unconstitutionality. In Proffitt v. Florida,supra, we upheld the Florida death penalty scheme againstthe contention that it resulted in arbitrary imposition of thedeath penalty, see Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153, 188 (1976),because "trial judges are given specific and detailed guidanceto assist them in deciding whether to impose a death penaltyor imprisonment for life" and because the Florida Supreme4 Justice Stevens's dissent says that "[g]iven that the judge's instruction to the jury failed to narrow the HAC aggravator, there is no reasonto believe that [the trial judge] appropriately narrowed the [HAC] factorin his . . . deliberations." Post, at 545. Our cases establish that thereis always a "reason to believe" that, which we consider fully adequate:"Trial judges are presumed to know the law and to apply it in makingtheir decisions. If the [State] Supreme Court has narrowed the definitionof the [HAC] aggravating circumstance, we presume that [state] trialjudges are applying the narrower definition." Walton v. Arizona, 497U. S., at 653. Without abandoning our precedent, the most Justice Stevens can argue is that the ordinary presumption is overcome by failureto instruct. The factual support for such an argument is questionable:Judges fail to instruct juries about rules of law they are aware of all thetime. Moreover, if the argument were correct, the holding in Espinosaitself would have been unnecessary: We could have simply said there(as Justice Stevens would have us say here) that the failure to instructon the narrowing construction displayed the judge's ignorance of thenarrowing construction. Instead, of course, Espinosa cited the passagefrom Walton quoted above. Espinosa, 505 U. S., at 1082.520US2 Unit: $U52 [09-10-99 19:18:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN533Cite as: 520 U. S. 518 (1997)Opinion of the CourtCourt reviewed sentences for consistency. Proffitt, 428 U. S.,at 253 ( joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, andStevens, JJ.);id., at 260-261 (opinion of White, J., joined by the Chief Jus-tice andRehnquist, J.). (In Proffitt itself, incidentally, thejury had not been instructed on an appropriately narrowedHAC aggravator, see Proffitt v. Wainwright, 685 F. 2d 1227,1264, n. 57 (CA11 1982), cert. denied, 464 U. S. 1002 (1983).)From what was said in Proffitt it would, as the en banc Elev-enth Circuit noted, "sensibly follow that the judge's properreview of the sentence cures any risk of arbitrariness occa-sioned by the jury's consideration of an unconstitutionallyvague aggravating circumstance." Glock v. Singletary, 65F. 3d 878, 886 (1995), cert. denied, 519 U. S. 888 (1996). Itcould have been argued, of course, as Justice Stevens contends, see post, at 543 (dissenting opinion), that prior constitutional error by a sentencing-determining jury would makea difference, but both the conclusion and the premise of thatargument were debatable: not only whether it would makea difference, but even (as the succeeding point demonstrates)whether there was any constitutional error by a sentencingdetermining jury.(2) There was no error for the trial judge to cure, sinceunder Florida law the trial court, not the jury, was the sentencer. In Espinosa we concluded, in effect, that the jurywas at least in part a cosentencer along with the trial court.That determination can fairly be traced to our opinion inSochor v. Florida, 504 U.

Id., at535-536. That characterization is in considerable tensionwith our pre-1986 view. In Proffitt, for example, after considering Tedder v. State, 322 So. 2d 908 (Fla. 1975), on whichEspinosa primarily relied, the Court determined that thetrial court was the sentencer. E. g., 428 U. S., at 249 ( jointopinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.) ("[T]he actual520US2 Unit: $U52 [09-10-99 19:18:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN534 LAMBRIX v.

We even distinguished the Floridascheme from the Georgia scheme on the ground that "inFlorida the sentence is determined by thetrial judge ratherthan by the jury." Id., at 252 ( joint opinion) (emphasisadded). Some eight years later, just two years before petitioner's conviction became final, we continued to describe thejudge asthe sentencer. See Spaziano v. Florida, 468 U. S.447 (1984); see also Barclay v. Florida, 463 U. S. 939, 952-954(1983) (plurality opinion); id., at 962 (Stevens, J., concurringin judgment). (Although he now believes the jury is a cosentencer, at the time Lambrix's conviction became finalJustice Stevens had explained that "the sentencing authority [is] the jury in Georgia, the judge in Florida." Ibid.)It would not have been unreasonable to rely on what we hadsaid in Proffitt, Spaziano, and Barclay--that the trial courtwas the sentencer--and to conclude that where the sentencerconsidered properly narrowed aggravators there was simplyno error under Godfrey or Maynard. The Florida SupremeCourt and the Eleventh Circuit held precisely that in 1989,see Smalley v. State, 546 So. 2d 720, 722; Bertolotti v. Dugger, 883 F. 2d 1503, 1526-1527, cert. denied, 497 U. S. 1032(1990); and in 1985 the Eleventh Circuit foresaw the possibility of such a holding: "[Spaziano's] reasoning calls intoquestion whether any given error in such a merely `advisory'proceeding should be considered to be of constitutional magnitude." Proffitt v. Wainwright, 756 F. 2d 1500, 1502.(3) The trial court's weighing of properly narrowed aggravators and mitigators was sufficiently independent ofthe jury to cure any error in the jury's consideration of avague aggravator. Although the Florida Supreme Court hadinterpreted its statute--which provided that the judge wasthe sentencer, Fla. Stat. $ 921.141(3) (Supp. 1992), and that the520US2 Unit: $U52 [09-10-99 19:18:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN535Cite as: 520 U.

State, supra, that courtnonetheless emphasized that the trial court must "independently weigh the evidence in aggravation and mitigation," andthat "[u]nder no combination of circumstances can th[e][ jury's] recommendation usurp the judge's role by limitinghis discretion."Eutzy v. State, 458 So. 2d 755, 759 (Fla.1984), cert. denied, 471 U. S. 1045 (1985). In one case, theFlorida Supreme Court vacated a sentence because the trialcourt had given "undue weight to the jury's recommendation of death and did not make an independent judgment ofwhether or not the death penalty should be imposed."Rossv. State, 386 So. 2d 1191, 1197 (1980) (emphasis added). InSpaziano v. Florida, supra, we acknowledged that the Flor-ida trial court conducts "its own weighing of the aggravatingand mitigating circumstances," id., at 451, and that "[r]egard-less of the jury's recommendation, the trial judge is requiredto conduct an independent review of the evidence and tomake his own findings regarding aggravating and mitigatingcircumstances," id., at 466 (emphasis added); see also Proffitt, 428 U.

See supra, at 526, 533-534 and this page. Justice Stevens, however, fails to discuss, or indeed even mention, the cases interpretingTedder that contradict the dissent's view--cases in both this Court andthe Florida Supreme Court repeatedly emphasizing the trial judge's obligation to make an independent assessment and weighing of the aggravating and mitigating circumstances. He relies, for example, upon theFlorida Supreme Court's decision in Riley v. Wainwright, 517 So. 2d 656(1987), see post, at 541, n. 3 (a decision rendered after Lambrix's convictionbecame final and hence not technically relevant). But subsequent to thatcase the Florida Supreme Court summarized its jurisprudence as follows:"Our case law contains many instances where a trial judge's overrideof a jury recommendation of life has been upheld. Notwithstanding thejury recommendation, whether it be for life imprisonment or death, thejudge is required to make an independent determination, based on the520US2 Unit: $U52 [09-10-99 19:18:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN536 LAMBRIX v.

S. 738 (1990), see also Stringer, 503U. S., at 237. In fact, given the view of some Members ofthis Court that appellate reweighing was inconsistent withthe Eighth Amendment, see, e. g., Cabana v. Bullock, 474U. S. 376, 400-401, 404 (1986) (Blackmun, J., dissenting,joined by Brennan and Marshall, JJ.); Clemons, supra, at769-772 (Blackmun, J., joined by Brennan, Marshall, andStevens, JJ., concurring in part and dissenting in part), itwould have been reasonable to think that trial-court reweighing was preferable. As one Court of Appeals wasprompted to note, "Clemons's holding, which arguably pointsin the opposite direction from Espinosa, indicates that evenin 1990 Espinosa's result would not have been dictated byprecedent." Glock v. Singletary, 65 F. 3d, at 887 (en banc).That Espinosa announced a new rule is strongly confirmedby our decision in Walton v. Arizona, 497 U. S. 639 (1990).Although decided after petitioner's conviction became final,Walton is a particularly good proxy for what a reasonablejurist would have thought in 1986, given that the only relevant cases decided by this Court in the interim were Maynard and Clemons, the holdings of both of which, we lateraggravating and mitigating factors. Moreover, this procedure has beenpreviously upheld against constitutional challenge." Grossman v. State,525 So. 2d 833, 840 (Fla. 1988) (emphasis added; citations omitted). "It isclear . . . that the prosecutor correctly stated the law in Florida: thejudge is the sentencing authority and the jury's role is merely advisory."Id., at 839. It is not our burden, of course, to establish that these statements in Grossman, or in the other cases we rely upon, were accurate; aswe later determined, they were wrong and the dissent's (current) readingof Tedder is correct. But the question before us is whether a reasonablejurist could have disagreed with the dissent's interpretation of Tedder atthe time of Lambrix's conviction. In treating as relevant to that questiononly that portion of precedent vindicated by later decisions, Justice Stevens "endues the jurist with prescience, not reasonableness." Stringerv. Black, 503 U.

S. 518 (1997)Opinion of the Courtheld, were compelled by the law in 1985, see Stringer, supra.In Walton, we rejected a claim that Arizona's HAC aggravator failed sufficiently to channel the sentencer's discretion.Summarizing Godfrey and Maynard, we explained that "inneither case did the state appellate court, in reviewing thepropriety of the death sentence, purport to affirm the deathsentence by applying a limiting definition," and this, we said,"w[as] crucial to the conclusion we reached inMaynard."Walton, supra, at 653. This reasoning suggests that evenfollowing Maynard, a weighing-state death sentence wouldsatisfy the Eighth Amendment so long as the vague aggravator was narrowed at some point in the process. Addition-ally, in the course of our opinion, we characterizedClemonsas follows:"[E]ven if a trial judge fails to apply the narrowing con-struction or applies an improper construction, the Constitution does not necessarily require that a state appel-late court vacate a death sentence based on that factor.Rather, as we held in Clemons v. Mississippi, 494 U. S.738 (1990), a state appellate court may itself determinewhether the evidence supports the existence of the ag-gravating circumstance as properly definedor the courtmay eliminate consideration of the factor altogether anddetermine whether any remaining aggravating circum-stances are sufficient to warrant the death penalty."Walton, supra, at 653-654 (emphasis added).Our use of the disjunctive suggests that as late as 1990, if aFlorida trial court determined that the defendant's conductfell within the narrowed HAC aggravator, the sentencewould satisfy the Eighth Amendment irrespective ofwhether the trial court reweighed the aggravating and miti-gating factors.6 The holdings in Stringer, Maynard, Clem6 Justice Stevens is thus simply wrong in stating that we have confused appellate application of a limiting construction with a trial court'sdeference to a tainted jury recommendation, see post, at 545 (dissenting520US2 Unit: $U52 [09-10-99 19:18:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN538 LAMBRIX v. SINGLETARYOpinion of the Courtons, and Godfrey cannot be thought to suggest otherwise,because there was no indication in those cases that the statecourts had found the facts of the crimes to fall within appro-priately narrowed definitions of the aggravators. BeforeEspinosa, we had never invalidated a death sentence wherea court found the challenged aggravator to be within theappellate court's narrowed definition of a facially vagueaggravator.Most of Justice Stevens's dissent is devoted to makinga forceful case thatEspinosa was a reasonable interpreta-tion of prior law--perhaps even the most reasonable one.But the Teague inquiry--which is applied to Supreme Courtdecisions that are, one must hope,usually the most reason-able interpretation of prior law--requires more than that.It asks whether Espinosa was dictated by precedent--i. e.,whether no other interpretation was reasonable. We thinkit plain from the above that a jurist considering all the rele-vant material (and not, likeJustice Stevens's dissent, con-sidering only the material that favors theEspinosa result)could reasonably have reached a conclusion contrary to ourholding in that case. Indeed, both before and after Lambrix's conviction became final, every court decision we areaware of did so. See,e. g., Smalley v. State, 546 So. 2d, at722; Proffitt v. Wainwright, 756 F. 2d, at 1502; Bertolotti v.Dugger, 883 F. 2d, at 1527; Sanchez-Velasco v. State, 570 So.2d 908, 916 (Fla. 1990), cert. denied, 500 U. S. 929 (1991).It has been suggested thatEspinosa was not a new rulebecause our decision was handed down as a per curiam without oral argument. See, e. g., Glock v. Singletary, 65 F. 3d,at 896, n. 11 (en banc) (Tjoflat, C. J., dissenting). Whateveropinion). Walton indicated that our precedents provided two distinctand permissible routes to satisfy the Eighth Amendment where the sentencer considered a vague aggravator: a court's finding of the aggravatorunder a proper limiting construction, or independent reweighing of thecircumstances.520US2 Unit: $U52 [09-10-99 19:18:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN539Cite as: 520 U. S. 518 (1997)Opinion of the Courtinference of established law a summary, per curiam disposi-tion might normally carry is precluded by the peculiar circumstances surrounding the summary per curiam in Es-pinosa. Just three weeks prior to our issuance of Espinosa,we had decided a case that raised the identical issue, and inwhich that issue had been fully briefed and argued; we foundourselves without jurisdiction to decide the point, however,because the defendant had failed to preserve his objection inthe state courts. See Sochor v. Florida, 504 U. S., at 533-534. It is obvious on the face of the matter thatEspinosawas only in the most technical sense an "unargued" case: Weused that case, which was pending on petition for certiorariwhenSochor was decided, as the vehicle for resolving a fullyargued point without consuming additional resources.VSince we have determined that Espinosa announced a newrule under Teague, there remains only the task of determining whether that new rule nonetheless falls within one of thetwo exceptions to our nonretroactivity doctrine. "The firstexception permits the retroactive application of a new ruleif the rule places a class of private conduct beyond the powerof the State to proscribe, see Teague, 489 U. S., at 311, oraddresses a `substantive categorical guarante[e] accorded bythe Constitution,' such as a rule `prohibiting a certain cate-gory of punishment for a class of defendants because of theirstatus or offense.' " Saffle v. Parks, 494 U. S., at 494 (quot-ingPenry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S., at 329, 330). Plainly, thisexception has no application to this case. Espinosa "neitherdecriminalize[s] a class of conduct nor prohibit[s] the imposi-tion of capital punishment on a particular class of persons."494 U. S., at 495.The second exception is for " `watershed rules of criminalprocedure' implicating the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding." Ibid. (quoting Teague,520US2 Unit: $U52 [09-10-99 19:18:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN540 LAMBRIX v. SINGLETARYStevens, J., dissentingsupra, at 311). Lambrix does not contend that this exception applies to Espinosa errors, and our opinion in Sawyerv. Smith, 497 U. S., at 241-244, makes it quite clear thatthat is so.* * *For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court ofAppeals for the Eleventh Circuit is Affirmed.Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Ginsburg andJustice Breyer join, dissenting.Two propositions of law supported our holding in Espinosav. Florida, 505 U. S. 1079 (1992) (per curiam): First, in acapital sentencing proceeding in a State where the sentencer weighs aggravating and mitigating circumstances,the Eighth Amendment is violated by a jury instructionthat fails to define the "especially heinous, atrocious, orcruel" (HAC) aggravating circumstance. Second, in a Florida sentencing proceeding the trial court must give " `greatweight' " to the jury's recommendation, whether it be for lifeor death. Id., at 1082. For these reasons, we concludedin Espinosa that constitutional error that taints the jury'srecommendation presumptively taints the judge's sentenceas well. Ibid. The two propositions supporting the Espinosa holding were well established when that case wasdecided. The first proposition dates back to 1980 when wedecided Godfrey v. Georgia, 446 U. S. 420, 428-429,1 andthe second was announced by the Florida Supreme Court in1 Godfrey, of course, held that Georgia's "outrageously or wantonly vile,horrible and inhuman" aggravating factor failed to adequately channel thejury's discretion. See 446 U. S., at 428-429. We found the "heinous, atrocious or cruel" aggravator unconstitutional in Maynard v. Cartwright, 486U. S. 356, 359 (1988), and subsequently noted that application of Godfreyto the HAC instruction did not create a new rule. See Stringer v. Black,503 U. S. 222, 228-229 (1992).520US2 Unit: $U52 [09-10-99 19:18:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN541Cite as: 520 U. S. 518 (1997)Stevens, J., dissenting1975 in Tedder v. State, 322 So. 2d 908, 910.2 Thus I agreewith Chief Judge Tjoflat that our per curiam opinion in Espinosa amounted to "nothing more than an application ofwell-settled principles. . . . In declaring the Florida HACinstruction unconstitutional, the Court simply applied thelaw as announced initially inGodfrey and later reaffirmed inMaynard [v. Cartwright, 486 U. S. 356 (1988]). The Court'sconclusion--that the invalid instruction may have tainted thejury's death penalty recommendation and the trial judge'ssentence--merely acknowledged what the Supreme Courtof Florida has been holding for years." Glock v. Singletary,65 F. 3d 878, 896 (CA11 1995) (dissenting opinion) (footnotesomitted).3Today the Court reaches the conclusion that Espinosa an-nounced a new rule by placing a novel interpretation on itsholding. The majority apparently construes Espinosa asholding that the constitutional error in the jury instructionwill "automatically render a defendant's sentence unconstitu-tional."Ante, at 530.4 The Court suggests that our hold-ings in Godfrey, Maynard v. Cartwright, 486 U. S. 356 (1988),and Clemons v. Mississippi, 494 U. S. 738, 745 (1990)--that2 These two "controlling precedents," both of which were cited in theEspinosa opinion, provided sufficient support for its holding. Thus theCourt is simply mistaken when it asserts that "Espinosa itself did notpurport to rely upon any controlling precedent." Ante, at 528.3 Tedder, of course, was not an isolated decision. In Riley v. Wainwright, 517 So. 2d 656 (Fla. 1987), the State Supreme Court put the pointsuccinctly: "If the jury's recommendation, upon which the judge must rely,results from an unconstitutional procedure, then the entire sentencingprocess necessarily is tainted by that procedure." Id., at 659. The Rileycourt relied on a pre-Tedder decision stating that the advisory opinion ofthe jury "is an integral part of the death sentencing process." 517 So. 2d,at 657 (citing Lamadline v. State, 303 So. 2d 17, 20 (Fla. 1974)).4 Responding to this dissent in n. 2, ante, at 528, the Court states thatthe clause I have quoted was not intended to describe the Court's understanding of the holding in Espinosa. If that be so, the relevance of thisportion of the Court's opinion, including its reliance on Godfrey and Maynard, is opaque, at best.520US2 Unit: $U52 [09-10-99 19:18:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN542 LAMBRIX v. SINGLETARYStevens, J., dissentingan appellate court could cure a sentencing jury's weighing ofan invalid aggravator--might have led a reasonable juristdown a road different from the one the Court followed inEspinosa.5 But in holding that a trial judge's sentence maybe infected by the jury's consideration of an invalid aggra-vating factor,Espinosa did not address the entirely separatequestion of whether the jury's error could be cured or considered harmless either at the trial or the appellate level.Indeed, in subsequent proceedings the Supreme Court ofFlorida did conclude that the error in Espinosa's case washarmless and upheld his sentence of death. See Espinosav. State, 626 So. 2d 165, 167 (1993) (ruling that Espinosa'sHAC instruction claim was procedurally barred because hehad challenged the HAC factor rather than the instructionitself and, alternatively, that any error in the instructionwas harmless beyond a reasonable doubt), cert. denied, 511U. S. 1152 (1994), and affirmed Espinosa's sentence. Our decision in Espinosa did not create a new rule prohibiting trialcourts from curing a jury's error, rather it held that "if aweighing State decides to place capital sentencing authorityin two actors rather than one, neither actor must be permitted to weigh invalid aggravating circumstances." 505 U. S.,at 1082. This holding is a logical consequence of applyingGodfrey to Florida's sentencing scheme.In a sinuous, difficult to follow argument, the Court suggests that three hypothetical propositions of law somehowdemonstrate that the narrow holding inEspinosa was notdictated by Godfrey and Tedder. First, the Court positsthat a reasonable jurist might have believed that "[t]he merecabining of the trial court's discretion" was alone enough toavoid constitutional error. Ante, at 532 (emphasis deleted).5 The Court also relies heavily on a passage in our opinion in Walton v.Arizona, 497 U. S. 639 (1990), noting that a trial judge's failure to apply anarrowing construction to an invalid aggravator " `does not necessarilyrequire that a state appellate court vacate a death sentence based on thatfactor.' " Ante, at 537.520US2 Unit: $U52 [09-10-99 19:18:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN543Cite as: 520 U. S. 518 (1997)Stevens, J., dissentingA critical part of that "cabining," however, is Florida's re-quirement that a properly instructed jury must have an opportunity to recommend a life sentence, and that the judgemust give great weight to that recommendation. The roleof the jury is to provide one of the cabin's four walls. Thefact that three walls remain standing hardly excuses an errorthat removed the wall represented by the jury's recommendation. At the time of petitioner's sentencing, the FloridaSupreme Court recognized the jury's critical role, and, whenerror occurred before the jury, did not hesitate to remandfor resentencing, even when the trial judge claimed to beunaffected by the error. For example in Messer v. State,330 So. 2d 137, 142 (1976), the State Supreme Court remanded for resentencing when the trial court failed to allowthe jury to consider certain mitigating evidence. The courtrejected the argument that the trial court's subsequentweighing of the mitigating evidence cured the error: TheFlorida scheme, the court concluded, was one of "checks andbalances in which the input of the jury serves as an integralpart." Ibid. Our holding in Proffitt v. Florida, 428 U. S.242, 255 (1976) ( joint opinion), that Florida's sentencingscheme is not facially unconstitutional does not suggest otherwise. There, we determined that the State's sentencingprocedure provided adequate safeguards against arbitraryimposition of the death sentence in part because of the procedures followed by the trial judge in fixing the sentence. Ourfocus was on the adequacy of the guidance provided by thesentencing scheme; accordingly, we had no need to extensively examine or discuss the judge's relationship to the juryor Florida Supreme Court decisions like Tedder.Second, simply ignoring the reasoning in Tedder, the Courtsuggests that there was "no error for the trial judge tocure, since under Florida law the trial court, not the jury,was the sentencer." Ante, at 533 (emphasis deleted). It is,of course, true that the judge imposes the sentence afterreceiving the jury's recommendation. But this has never520US2 Unit: $U52 [09-10-99 19:18:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN544 LAMBRIX v. SINGLETARYStevens, J., dissentingmeant that constitutional error in the proceedings before thejury is simply irrelevant. Cf. Messer v. State, supra. Asthen-Justice Rehnquist noted in 1983, it is well-settledFlorida law that if the jury makes a recommendation of lifeimprisonment, "the trial judge may not impose a death sen-tence unless `the facts suggesting a sentence of death [are]so clear and convincing that virtually no reasonable personcould differ.'Tedder v. State, 322 So. 2d 908, 910 (1975)."Barclay v. Florida, 463 U. S. 939, 955-956 (plurality opinion).6 Similarly, a trial judge should not disturb a jury rec-ommendation of death "unless there appear strong reasonsto believe that reasonable persons could not agree with therecommendation." SeeLeDuc v. State, 365 So. 2d 149, 151(Fla. 1978), cert. denied, 444 U. S. 885 (1979). Given this,it is vacuous to argue that our prior references to the judgeas the sentencer somehow imply that an error before thejury would not affect the ultimate sentence. It is equallyvacuous to suggest that our conclusion inEspinosa "that thejury was at least in part a cosentencer" had its source in acase decided "just three weeks earlier,"ante, at 533 (citingSochor v. Florida, 504 U. S. 527 (1992)). In that earlier case,we citedTedder after explaining that the jury was a constituent element of the sentencer "because the trial judge doesnot render wholly independent judgment, but must accorddeference to the jury's recommendation." Sochor, 504 U. S.,at 533.Third, the Court suggests that the trial court's "weighingof properly narrowed aggravators and mitigators was suffi-ciently independent of the jury to cure any error in the jury'sconsideration of a vague aggravator." Ante, at 534 (em6 The Florida Supreme Court has applied Tedder in numerous cases toreverse a trial judge's override of a jury's life sentence. See, e. g., Waskov. State, 505 So. 2d 1314, 1318 (1987); Goodwin v. State, 405 So. 2d 170, 172(1981); Odom v. State, 403 So. 2d 936, 942-943 (1981), cert. denied, 456U. S. 925 (1982); Neary v.

S. 518 (1997)Stevens, J., dissentingphasis deleted). This suggestion is doubly flawed. Giventhat the judge's instruction to the jury failed to narrow theHAC aggravator, there is no reason to believe that he ap-propriately narrowed the factor in his own deliberations.7More importantly, even if he did apply a limiting definition,his sentencing decision was made without the benefit of anuntainted recommendation from the jury, and, under Floridalaw, he could not have simply resentenced the petitionerwithout regard to the jury's tainted recommendation. Norcan one simply conclude that this error made no practicaldifference in petitioner's sentence. There is nothing in therecord to suggest that had the jury recommended a life sentence, the judge would have found that "the facts suggestinga sentence of death were so clear and convincing that virtually no reasonable person could differ," as Tedder requires.Here, again, the Court finds that our statements in caseslike Walton v. Arizona, 497 U. S. 639 (1990), that a stateappellate court may affirm a death sentence resulting froman unconstitutionally broad aggravator by applying a limit-ing definition, suggest that Espinosa is a new rule. The majority's analysis confuses an appellate court's application of alimiting definition on appellate review with a trial judge'sdeference to a tainted jury recommendation. The judge inthis case did not indicate that he was applying a limitingdefinition of the HAC factor, or that he was in some otherway curing or discounting the error in the jury instruction.At the time of petitioner's sentencing, given Godfrey andTedder, this rendered petitioner's death sentence constitu-tionally defective.As a matter of logic and law there was nothing new aboutEspinosa's holding that the jury plays a central role in Flori-da's capital sentencing scheme. Moreover, as statistics that7 Nothing in the record indicates that the judge recognized that the juryinstruction was erroneous, or that he sought to cure that error in his ownweighing process. In finding that the HAC aggravator was present, thejudge merely stated: "The facts speak for themselves." App. 20.520US2 Unit: $U52 [09-10-99 19:18:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN546 LAMBRIX v.

Sochor v. Florida, 504 U.

I would instead vacate the judgment of theCourt of Appeals and remand the case so that the Courtof Appeals might consider the procedural bar issue in thefirst instance.The Court holds that, as a general practice, a federal ha-beas court should consider whether the relief a habeas petitioner requests is a "new rule" under Teague v. Lane, 489U. S. 288 (1989), only after resolving the State's argumentthat his claim is procedurally barred. Ante, at 525. Usu8 "As a matter of fact, the jury sentence is the sentence that is usuallyimposed by the Florida Supreme Court. The State has attached an appendix to its brief, see App. to Brief for Respondent A1-A70, setting forthdata concerning 469 capital cases that were reviewed by the Florida Supreme Court between 1980 and 1991. In 341 of those cases (73%), thejury recommended the death penalty; in none of those cases did the trialjudge impose a lesser sentence. In 91 cases (19%), the jury recommendeda life sentence; in all but one of those cases, the trial judge overrode thejury's recommended life sentence and imposed a death sentence. In 69 ofthose overrides (77%), however, the Florida Supreme Court vacated thetrial judge's sentence and either imposed a life sentence itself or remandedfor a new sentencing hearing."Two conclusions are evident. First, when the jury recommends adeath sentence, the trial judge will almost certainly impose that sentence.Second, when the jury recommends a life sentence, although overrideshave been sustained occasionally, the Florida Supreme Court will normally uphold the jury rather than the judge. It is therefore clear that inpractice, erroneous instructions to the jury at the sentencing phase of thetrial may make the difference between life or death." Sochor v. Florida,504 U.

As the Court recognizes,addressing the procedural bar issue first avoids unnecessaryconsideration of constitutional questions and accords fittingrespect to the State's procedural rules, which are indispensable to the administration of its criminal justice system.Ante, at 524-525.With this much of the Court's opinion I agree. Of course,there may be exceptions to the rule that the procedural barissue should be resolved first. One case might be where theprocedural bar question is excessively complicated, but theTeague issue can be easily resolved. The Court of Appealshere gave no reason for its failure to consider the FloridaSupreme Court's determination that petitioner's claim basedon Espinosa v. Florida, 505 U. S. 1079 (1992) (per curiam),was procedurally barred. Indeed, the Court of Appeals didnot even discuss the state court's holding, let alone decidethat resolution of the procedural bar issue would be inappropriate in this case. I see no reason to think resolution ofthe procedural bar question would be especially troublesome,nor do I see any other reason for the Court of Appeals' failure to give priority to the State's argument that an independent and adequate state ground barred petitioner'sEspinosa claim.Accordingly, I would remand the case to the Court of Appeals for it to resolve the procedural bar issue. As theCourt points out, the Court of Appeals is better suited toevaluating matters of state procedure than are we. Ante,at 525. In my view, then, it is premature to address theState's contention that petitioner's Espinosa claim is barredon Teague grounds. Nevertheless, since the Court reachesthe question, I wish to express my agreement with JusticeStevens' resolution of the Teague issue.520US2 Unit: $U53 [09-10-99 19:24:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN548 OCTOBER TERM, 1996SyllabusHARBOR TUG & BARGE CO. v. PAPAI et ux.certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuitNo. 95-1621. Argued January 13, 1997--Decided May 12, 1997Respondent Papai was injured while painting the housing structure of thetug Pt. Barrow. Petitioner Harbor Tug & Barge Co., the tug's operator, had hired him to do the work, which was expected to last one dayand would not involve sailing with the vessel. Papai had been employed by Harbor Tug on 12 previous occasions in the 21/2 months beforehis injury, receiving those jobs through the Inland Boatman's Union(IBU) hiring hall. He had been getting short-term jobs with variousvessels through the hiring hall for about 21/4 years. Most of those weredeckhand work, which Papai said involved manning the lines on- andoff-board vessels while they dock or undock. Papai sued Harbor Tug,claiming, inter alia, negligence under the Jones Act, and his wife joinedas a plaintiff, claiming loss of consortium. The District Court grantedHarbor Tug summary judgment upon finding that Papai did not enjoyseaman status under the Jones Act, and it later confirmed that adjudication. The Ninth Circuit reversed and remanded for a trial of, amongother things, Papai's seaman status and his corresponding Jones Actclaim. Based on Chandris, Inc. v. Latsis, 515 U. S. 347, the court described the relevant inquiry as not whether Papai had a permanent connection with the vessel but whether his relationship with a vessel or anidentifiable group of vessels was substantial in duration and nature, andfound that this required consideration of his employment's total circumstances. The court determined that a reasonable jury could concludethat Papai satisfied that test, for if the type of work a maritime workercustomarily performs would entitle him to seaman status if performedfor a single employer, he should not be deprived of that status simplybecause the industry operates under a daily assignment, rather than apermanent employment, system.Held:1. Because the issue whether the record permits a reasonable jury toconclude that Papai is a Jones Act seaman is here resolved in the employer's favor, this Court does not reach the question whether an administrative ruling for an employee on his claim of Longshore and HarborWorkers' Compensation Act coverage bars his claim of seaman status ina Jones Act suit. P. 550.520US2 Unit: $U53 [09-10-99 19:24:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN549Cite as: 520 U. S. 548 (1997)Syllabus2. This record would not permit a reasonable jury to conclude thatPapai is a Jones Act seaman. Jones Act coverage is confined to seamen,those workers who face regular exposure to the perils of the sea. Animportant part of the test for determining who is a seaman is whetherthe injured worker has a substantial connection to a vessel or to a fleetof vessels, and the latter concept requires a requisite degree of commonownership or control. Chandris, 515 U. S., at 366. The requisite linkis not established by the mere use of the same hiring hall which drawsfrom the same pool of employees. The various vessels on which Papaiworked through the IBU hiring hall in the 21/4 years before his injurywere not linked by any common ownership or control. Consideringprior employments with independent employers in making the seamanstatus inquiry would undermine "the interests of employers and maritime workers alike in being able to predict who will be covered by theJones Act . . . before a particular work day begins," id., at 363, and therewould be no principled basis for limiting which prior employments areconsidered for determining seaman status. That the IBU DeckhandsAgreement classified Papai as a deckhand does not give him claim toseaman status. Seaman status is based on his actual duties, South Chicago Coal & Dock Co. v. Bassett, 309 U. S. 251, 260, and Papai's dutiesduring the employment in question included no seagoing activity. Noris it reasonable to infer from his testimony that his 12 prior employments with Harbor Tug involved work of a seagoing nature that couldqualify him for seaman status.

The distinction between the two mutu-ally exclusive categories can be difficult to implement, andmany cases turn on their specific facts.The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held in thiscase that there was a jury question as to whether an injuredworker was a Jones Act seaman. Granting the employer'spetition for a writ of certiorari, we brought two questionsbefore us. The first is whether an administrative ruling infavor of the employee on his claim of coverage under theLHWCA bars his claim of seaman status in the Jones Actsuit he wishes to pursue in district court. The second iswhether this record would permit a reasonable jury to conclude the employee is a Jones Act seaman. We resolve thesecond question in the employer's favor and, as it is dispositive of the case, we do not reach the first.On the question of seaman status, there is an issue of significance beyond the facts of this case.

S. 347, 368 (1995), has been subject to differinginterpretations, and we seek to provide clarification.IRespondent John Papai was painting the housing structureof the tug Pt. Barrow when a ladder he was on moved, healleges, causing him to fall and injure his knee. App. 50.Petitioner Harbor Tug & Barge Co., the tug's operator, hadhired Papai to do the painting work. Id., at 44. A primecoat of paint had been applied and it was Papai's task toapply the finish coat. Id., at 45. There was no vessel cap-tain on board and Papai reported to the port captain, whohad a dockside office. Id., at 36-37. The employment wasexpected to begin and end the same day,id., at 35, 48, andPapai was not going to sail with the vessel after he finishedpainting, id., at 51. Papai had been employed by HarborTug on 12 previous occasions in the 21/2 months before hisinjury.Papai received his jobs with Harbor Tug through the Inland Boatman's Union (IBU) hiring hall. He had been get-ting jobs with various vessels through the hiring hall forabout 21/4 years. All the jobs were short term. The longestlasted about 40 days and most were for 3 days or under.Id.,at 29, 34. In a deposition, Papai described the work as coming under three headings: maintenance, longshoring, anddeckhand. Id., at 30-32. Papai said maintenance work involved chipping rust and painting aboard docked vessels.Id., at 30, 34-35. Longshoring work required helping to discharge vessels. Id., at 31. Deckhand work involved man-ning the lines on- and off-board vessels while they docked orundocked. Id., at 30. As for the assignments he obtainedthrough the hiring hall over 21/4 years, most of them, saysPapai, involved deckhand work. Id., at 34.After his alleged injury aboard thePt. Barrow, Papai suedHarbor Tug in the United States District Court for theNorthern District of California, claiming negligence under520US2 Unit: $U53 [09-10-99 19:24:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN552 HARBOR TUG & BARGE CO. v. PAPAIOpinion of the Courtthe Jones Act and unseaworthiness under general maritimelaw, in addition to other causes of action. His wife joined asa plaintiff, claiming loss of consortium. Harbor Tug soughtsummary judgment on Papai's Jones Act and unseaworthiness claims, contending he was not a seaman and so could notprevail on either claim. The District Court granted HarborTug's motion and later denied Papai's motion for reconsideration. After our decisions in McDermott Int'l, Inc. v.Wilander, 498 U. S. 337 (1991), and Southwest Marine, Inc.v. Gizoni, 502 U. S. 81 (1991), the District Court granted amotion by Harbor Tug "to confirm" the earlier summaryadjudication of Papai's nonseaman status. The DistrictCourt reasoned, under a test since superseded, see Chandris, supra, that Papai was not a seaman within the meaning of the Jones Act or the general maritime law, because"he did not have a `more or less permanent connection' withthe vessel on which he was injured nor did he perform substantial work on the vessel sufficient for seaman status."App. to Pet. for Cert. 27a.The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed andremanded for a trial of Papai's seaman status and his corresponding Jones Act and unseaworthiness claims. Based onour decision in Chandris, the court described the relevantinquiry as "not whether plaintiff had a permanent connectionwith the vessel [but] whether plaintiff 's relationship with avessel (or a group of vessels) was substantial in terms ofduration and nature, which requires consideration of thetotal circumstances of his employment." 67 F. 3d 203, 206(1995). A majority of the panel believed it would be reasonable for a jury to conclude the employee satisfied that test.In the majority's view, "[i]f the type of work a maritimeworker customarily performs would entitle him to seamanstatus if performed for a single employer, the worker shouldnot be deprived of that status simply because the industryoperates under a daily assignment rather than a permanentemployment system." Ibid. The majority also said the520US2 Unit: $U53 [09-10-99 19:24:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN553Cite as: 520 U. S. 548 (1997)Opinion of the Court"circumstance" that Papai had worked for Harbor Tug on 12occasions during the 21/2 months before his injury "may initself provide a sufficient connection" to Harbor Tug's vesselsto establish seaman status. Ibid.Judge Poole dissented from the majority's holding thatthere was a triable issue as to Papai's seaman status. Herecognized that Chandris held out the possibility of being aseaman without a substantial connection to a particular vessel in navigation, provided one nevertheless had the requiredconnection to " `an identifiable group of such vessels.' " 67F. 3d, at 209 (quoting 515 U. S., at 368). Judge Poole said,however, it would be a mistake to view Chandris as holdingthat, for seaman-status purposes, a "group may be identifiedsimply as those vessels on which a sailor sails, not just thoseof a particular employer or controlling entity. . . . Th[e majority's holding] renders the `identifiable group' or `fleet' requirement a nullity." 67 F. 3d, at 209 (citation omitted).Judge Poole also noted that the majority's position conflictedwith that of the Fifth Circuit (en banc) and of a Third Circuitpanel.

Id., at 355-356.520US2 Unit: $U53 [09-10-99 19:24:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN554 HARBOR TUG & BARGE CO. v. PAPAIOpinion of the CourtOur recent cases explain the proper inquiry to determineseaman status. We need not restate that doctrinal development, see id., at 355-368; Wilander, supra, at 341-354, toresolve Papai's claim. It suffices to citeChandris, whichheld, in pertinent part:"[T]he essential requirements for seaman status aretwofold. First, . . . an employee's duties must contrib-ut[e] to the function of the vessel or to the accomplishment of its mission. . . ."Second, and most important for our purposes here, aseaman must have a connection to a vessel in navigation(or to an identifiable group of such vessels) that is sub-stantial in terms of both its duration and its nature."515 U. S., at 368 (citations and internal quotationmarks omitted).The seaman inquiry is a mixed question of law and fact, andit often will be inappropriate to take the question from thejury. Nevertheless, "summary judgment or a directed ver-dict is mandated where the facts and the law will reasonablysupport only one conclusion." Wilander, supra, at 356; seealso Chandris, 515 U. S., at 368-369.Harbor Tug does not dispute that it would be reasonablefor a jury to conclude Papai's duties aboard the Pt. Barrow(or any other vessel he worked on through the IBU hiringhall) contributed to the function of the vessel or the accomplishment of its mission, satisfying Chandris' first standard.Nor does Harbor Tug dispute that a reasonable jury couldconclude that the Pt. Barrow or other vessels Papai workedon were in navigation. The result, as will often be the case,is that seaman status turns on the part of Chandris' secondstandard which requires the employee to show "a connectionto a vessel in navigation (or to an identifiable group of suchvessels) that is substantial in terms of both its duration andits nature." Id., at 368. We explained the rule as follows:520US2 Unit: $U53 [09-10-99 19:24:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN555Cite as: 520 U. S. 548 (1997)Opinion of the Court"The fundamental purpose of th[e] substantial connec-tion requirement is to give full effect to the remedialscheme created by Congress and to separate the sea-based maritime employees who are entitled to Jones Actprotection from those land-based workers who have onlya transitory or sporadic connection with a vessel in navigation, and therefore whose employment does not regu-larly expose them to the perils of the sea."Ibid.For the substantial connection requirement to serve its pur-pose, the inquiry into the nature of the employee's connectionto the vessel must concentrate on whether the employee'sduties take him to sea. This will give substance to the inquiry both as to the duration and nature of the employee'sconnection to the vessel and be helpful in distinguishingland-based from sea-based employees.Papai argues, and the Court of Appeals majority held, thatPapai meets Chandris' second test based on his employmentswith the various vessels he worked on through the IBU hiring hall in the 21/4 years before his injury, vessels owned, itappears, by three different employers not linked by any common ownership or control, App. 38. He also did longshoringwork through the hiring hall,id., at 31, and it appears thiswas for still other employers,id., at 38. As noted above,Papai testified at his deposition that the majority of his workduring this period was deckhand work. According to Papai,this satisfies Chandris because the group of vessels Papaiworked on through the IBU hiring hall constitutes "an iden-tifiable group of . . . vessels" to which he has a "substantialconnection." 515 U. S., at 368.The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit was the first tohold that a worker could qualify as a seaman based on hisconnection to a group of vessels rather than a particular one.In Braniff v. Jackson Ave.-Gretna Ferry, Inc., 280 F. 2d523 (1960), the court held the employer was not entitled tosummary judgment on the seaman-status question where an520US2 Unit: $U53 [09-10-99 19:24:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN556 HARBOR TUG & BARGE CO. v. PAPAIOpinion of the Courtemployee's job was to perform maintenance work on the em-ployer's fleet of ferry boats, often while the boats were running: "The usual thing, of course, is for a person to have aJones Act seaman status in relation to a particular vessel.But there is nothing about this . . . concept to limit it mechanically to a single ship." Id., at 528. There is "no insur-mountable difficulty," the court explained, in finding seamanstatus based on the employee's relationship to "several spe-cific vessels"--"an identifiable fleet"--as opposed to a singleone. Ibid.We, in turn, adverted to the group of vessels concept inChandris. We described it as a rule "allow[ing] seaman status for those workers who had the requisite connection withan `identifiable fleet' of vessels, a finite group of vessels undercommon ownership or control." 515 U. S., at 366. The majority in the Court of Appeals did not discuss our descriptionof the group of vessels concept as requiring common ownership or control, nor did it discuss other Courts of Appealscases applying the concept, see, e. g., Reeves v. MobileDredging & Pumping Co., 26 F. 3d, at 1258. The courtpointed to this statement from Chandris: "[W]e see no reason to limit the seaman status inquiry . . . exclusively to anexamination of the overall course of a worker's service with aparticular employer." 515 U. S., at 371-372. It interpretedthis to mean "it may be necessary to examine the work performed by the employee while employed by different employers during the relevant time period." 67 F. 3d, at 206.The court did not define what it meant by "the relevant timeperiod." In any event, the context of our statement inChandris makes clear our meaning, which is that the employee's prior work history with a particular employer may notaffect the seaman inquiry if the employee was injured on anew assignment with the same employer, an assignmentwith different "essential duties" from his previous ones. 515U. S., at 371. In Chandris, the words "particular employer"give emphasis to the point that the inquiry into the nature520US2 Unit: $U53 [09-10-99 19:24:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN557Cite as: 520 U. S. 548 (1997)Opinion of the Courtof the employee's duties for seaman-status purposes mayconcentrate on a narrower, not broader, period than the employee's entire course of employment with his current em-ployer. There was no suggestion of a need to examine thenature of an employee's duties with prior employers. Seealso id., at 367 ("Since Barrett [v. Chevron, U. S. A., Inc., 781F. 2d 1067 (CA5 1986) (en banc)], the Fifth Circuit consistently has analyzed the problem [of determining seaman sta-tus] in terms of the percentage of work performed on vesselsfor the employer in question"). The Court of Appeals ma-jority interpreted the words "particular employer" outsidethe limited discussion in which we used them and, as a result,gave the phrase a meaning opposite from what the contextrequires.The Court of Appeals stressed that various of Papai's employers had "join[ed] together to obtain a common labor poolon which they draw by means of a union hiring hall." 67F. 3d, at 206; see also id., at 206, n. 3 (suggesting that thiscase involves a "group of vessels [that] have collectivelyagreed to obtain employees" from a hiring hall). There isno evidence in the record that the contract Harbor Tug hadwith the IBU about employing deckhands (IBU DeckhandsAgreement) was negotiated by a multiemployer bargaininggroup, and, even if it had been, that would not affect theresult here. There was no showing that the group of vesselsthe court sought to identify were subject to unitary ownership or control in any aspect of their business or operation.So far as the record shows, each employer was free to hire,assign, and direct workers for whatever tasks and timeperiod they each determined, limited, at most, by the IBUDeckhands Agreement. In deciding whether there is anidentifiable group of vessels of relevance for a Jones Actseaman-status determination, the question is whether thevessels are subject to common ownership or control. Therequisite link is not established by the mere use of the samehiring hall which draws from the same pool of employees.520US2 Unit: $U53 [09-10-99 19:24:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN558 HARBOR TUG & BARGE CO. v. PAPAIOpinion of the CourtConsidering prior employments with independent employ-ers in making the seaman-status inquiry would undermine"the interests of employers and maritime workers alike inbeing able to predict who will be covered by the Jones Act(and, perhaps more importantly for purposes of the employers' workers' compensation obligations, who will be coveredby the LHWCA) before a particular work day begins."Chandris, supra, at 363. There would be no principled basisfor limiting which prior employments are considered fordetermining seaman status. The Court of Appeals spoke ofa "relevant time period" but, as noted above, it did not definethis term. Since the substantial connection standard isoften, as here, the determinative element of the seamaninquiry, it must be given workable and practical confines.When the inquiry further turns on whether the employee hasa substantial connection to an identifiable group of vessels,common ownership or control is essential for this purpose.Papai contends his various employers through the hiringhall would have been able to predict his status as a seamanunder the Jones Act based on the seagoing nature of some ofthe duties he could have been hired to perform consistentwith his classification as a "qualified deckhand" under theIBU Deckhands Agreement. By the terms of the agreement, Papai was qualified as a "satisfactory helmsman andlookout," for example, and he could have been hired to servea vessel while it was underway, in which case his dutieswould have included "conduct[ing] a check of the engineroom status a minimum of two (2) times each watch . . . forvessel safety reasons." App. 77. In South Chicago Coal &Dock Co. v. Bassett, 309 U. S. 251 (1940), we rejected a claimto seaman status grounded on the employee's job title, whichalso happened to be "deckhand." "The question," we said,"concerns his actual duties." Id., at 260. See also Northeast Marine Terminal Co. v. Caputo, 432 U. S. 249, 268, n. 30(1977) (reasoning that employee's membership in longshoremen's union was, in itself, irrelevant to whether employee520US2 Unit: $U53 [09-10-99 19:24:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN559Cite as: 520 U. S. 548 (1997)Opinion of the Courtwas covered by the LHWCA, as fact of union membershipwas unrelated to the purposes of the LHWCA's coverageprovisions). The question is what connection the employeehad in actual fact to vessel operations, not what a unionagreement says. Papai was qualified under the IBU Deckhands Agreement to perform nonseagoing work in additionto the seagoing duties described above. His actual duty onthe Pt. Barrow throughout the employment in question didnot include any seagoing activity; he was hired for one dayto paint the vessel at dockside and he was not going to sailwith the vessel after he finished painting it. App. 44, 48, 51.This is not a case where the employee was hired to performseagoing work during the employment in question, howeverbrief, and we need not consider here the consequencesof such an employment. The IBU Deckhands Agreementgives no reason to assume that any particular percentage ofPapai's work would be of a seagoing nature, subjecting himto the perils of the sea. In these circumstances, the unionagreement does not advance the accuracy of the seamanstatus inquiry.Papai argues he qualifies as a seaman if we consider his 12prior employments with Harbor Tug over the 21/2 monthsbefore his injury. Papai testified at his deposition that heworked aboard the Pt. Barrow on three or four occasionsbefore the day he was injured, the most recent of which wasmore than a week earlier. Id., at 35, 44. Each of these engagements involved only maintenance work while the tugwas docked. Id., at 34-35. The nature of Papai's connection to the Pt. Barrow was no more substantial for seamanstatus purposes by virtue of these engagements than the oneduring which he was injured. Papai does not identify withspecificity what he did for Harbor Tug the other eight ornine times he worked for the company in the 21/2 monthsbefore his injury. The closest he comes is his deposition testimony that 70 percent of his work over the 21/4 years beforehis injury was deckhand work. Id., at 34. Coupled with520US2 Unit: $U53 [09-10-99 19:24:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN560 HARBOR TUG & BARGE CO. v. PAPAIStevens, J., dissentingthe fact that none of Papai's work aboard the Pt. Barrowwas of a seagoing nature, it would not be reasonable to inferfrom Papai's testimony that his recent engagements withHarbor Tug involved work of a seagoing nature. In anyevent, these discrete engagements were separate from theone in question, which was the sort of "transitory or spo-radic" connection to a vessel or group of vessels that, aswe explained in Chandris, does not qualify one for seamanstatus. 515 U. S., at 368.Jones Act coverage is confined to seamen, those workerswho face regular exposure to the perils of the sea. An important part of the test for determining who is a seaman iswhether the injured worker seeking coverage has a substantial connection to a vessel or a fleet of vessels, and the latterconcept requires a requisite degree of common ownership orcontrol. The substantial connection test is important in distinguishing between sea- and land-based employment, forland-based employment is inconsistent with Jones Act coverage. This was the holding in Chandris, and we adhere to ithere. The only connection a reasonable jury could identifyamong the vessels Papai worked aboard is that each hiredsome of its employees from the same union hiring hall fromwhich Papai was hired. That is not sufficient to establishseaman status under the group of vessels concept. Papaihad the burden at summary judgment to "set forth specificfacts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Fed.Rule Civ. Proc. 56(e). He failed to meet it. The Court ofAppeals erred in holding otherwise. Its judgment isreversed. It is so ordered.Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Ginsburg andJustice Breyer join, dissenting.During the 2-year period immediately before his injury,respondent Papai worked as a maintenance man and a deckhand for various employers who hired out of the Inland Boat520US2 Unit: $U53 [09-10-99 19:24:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN561Cite as: 520 U.

If all of that deckhand work had been performedfor petitioner, there would be no doubt about Papai's statusas a seaman.Petitioner, however, did not maintain a permanent crewon any of its vessels. 67 F. 3d 203, 204 (CA9 1995). Instead,like other tugboat operators in the San Francisco Bay area,it obtained its deckhands on a job-by-job basis through theunion hiring hall. Under these circumstances, I believe theCourt of Appeals correctly concluded that Papai's status asa seaman should be tested by the character of his work forthe group of vessel owners that used the same union agentto make selections from the same pool of employees.In Chandris, Inc. v. Latsis, 515 U. S. 347 (1995), the Courtrejected a "voyage test" of seaman status, concluding thatan employee who was injured while performing his duties ona vessel on the high seas was not necessarily a Jones Actseaman. Id., at 358-364. The Court instead adopted astatus-based inquiry that looked at the nature and durationof the employee's relationship to a vessel--or an identifiablegroup of vessels--in navigation to determine whether thatemployee received Jones Act coverage. Id., at 370-371.Today, the majority apparently concludes that an employeeis not necessarily protected by the Jones Act even if he wasinjured aboard a vessel in navigation and his work over thepreceding two years was primarily seaman's work. I believe this conclusion is unsupported by either the reasoningor the language in the Chandris opinion.Chandris' status-based test requires a maritime worker tohave a relationship that is substantial in duration and naturewith a vessel, or an identifiable group of vessels, in navigation. See id., at 376. Nothing in the Court's holding thereintimated that the "identifiable group of vessels" need all be520US2 Unit: $U53 [09-10-99 19:24:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN562 HARBOR TUG & BARGE CO. v. PAPAIStevens, J., dissentingowned by the same person.1 Particularly in a labor marketdesigned to allow employers to rely on temporary workersfor a range of jobs, there is "no reason to limit the seamanstatus inquiry . . . exclusively to an examination of the overall course of a worker's service with a particular employer."Id., at 371-372. As the Court of Appeals observed in thiscase: "If the type of work a maritime worker customarilyperforms would entitle him to seaman status if performedfor a single employer, the worker should not be deprived ofthat status simply because the industry operates under adaily assignment rather than a permanent employmentsystem." 67 F. 3d, at 206.The unfairness created by the Court's rule is evident.Let us assume that none of the tugboat operators in the bayarea have permanent crews and that all of them obtain theirdeckhands on a more or less random basis through the samehiring hall. Further, assume that about 70 percent of thework performed by the employees thus obtained is seaman'swork, while the remainder is shore-based maintenance work.A typical employee working for a typical employer in thatpool would have the status of a seaman, and both the employees and the employers would be aware of this reality abouttheir work environment. But under the Court's reasoning,even if over 70 percent of his randomly selected assignmentsduring a 2-year period were seaman assignments, an injuredworker would not be a seaman for Jones Act purposes if hehappened to receive only a few assignments with the ownerof the particular boat on which he was injured and thoseassignments were not seaman's work.1 The majority puts great weight on Chandris' description of the FifthCircuit's case law developing the fleet doctrine as "modif[ying] the test toallow seaman status for those workers who had the requisite connectionwith an `identifiable fleet' of vessels, a finite group of vessels under common ownership or control." Chandris, 515 U. S., at 366. See ante, at556. But that description of the lower court's case law did not form partof the Chandris holding, and it should not control the outcome here.520US2 Unit: $U53 [09-10-99 19:24:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN563Cite as: 520 U. S. 548 (1997)Stevens, J., dissentingThe majority tries to justify this conclusion with the argu-ment that a rule acknowledging an employee's status as aseaman based on the work he does for a number of employerswho hire out of the same hiring hall would create uncertainties for employers. Ante, at 558. The Court's concern isthat an employer might not realize that an employee hehad selected to chip paint on a docked boat had spent mostof the past year as a deckhand on a neighboring vessel. Thisfear is exaggerated, since an employer who hires its workersout of a union hiring hall should be presumed to be familiarwith the general character of their work. Moreover, surelythe unfairness created by the majority's rule outweighs thisconcern.Of course, in order to hold a particular employer liable,an employment relationship must have existed between theworker and the particular vessel owner at the time of theinjury. Chandris teaches us, however, that the specific ac-tivity being performed at the time of the injury is not sufficient to establish the employee's status under the Jones Act.Rather, we must determine whether an employee has seaman status by looking at his work history. The character ofthat history in the market from which a vessel owner obtainsall of its crews seems to me just as relevant as the assign-ments to the particular operator for whom work was beingperformed when the injury occurred.Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the Court ofAppeals.22 On the question the Court does not reach, I think the Court of Appealscorrectly interpreted our opinion in Southwest Marine, Inc. v. Gizoni, 502U. S. 81 (1991). See also G. Gilmore & C. Black, Law of Admiralty 435(2d ed. 1975).520US2 Unit: $U54 [09-10-99 19:36:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN564 OCTOBER TERM, 1996SyllabusCAMPS NEWFOUND/OWATONNA, INC. v. TOWNOF HARRISONet al.certiorari to the supreme judicial court of maineNo. 94-1988. Argued October 9, 1996--Decided May 19, 1997Petitioner, a Maine nonprofit corporation, operates a church camp for children, most of whom are not Maine residents. Petitioner is financedthrough camper tuition and other revenues. From 1989 to 1991, it paidover $20,000 per year in real estate and personal property taxes. Astate statute provides a general exemption from those taxes for charitable institutions incorporated in Maine. With respect to institutionsoperated principally for the benefit of Maine nonresidents, however,a charity may only qualify for a more limited tax benefit, and thenonly if its weekly charge for services does not exceed $30 per person.Petitioner was ineligible for any exemption, because its campers werelargely nonresidents and its weekly tuition was roughly $400 percamper. After respondent town of Harrison (Town) rejected its request for a refund of taxes already paid and a continuing exemptionfrom future taxes, which was based principally on a claim that the taxexemption statute violated the Commerce Clause, petitioner filed suitand was awarded summary judgment by the Superior Court. TheMaine Supreme Judicial Court reversed, holding that petitioner had notmet its burden of persuasion that the statute is unconstitutional.Held: An otherwise generally applicable state property tax violates theCommerce Clause if its exemption for property owned by charitableinstitutions excludes organizations operated principally for the benefitof nonresidents. Pp. 571-595.(a) Because the Government lacked power to regulate interstate commerce during the Nation's first years, the States freely adopted measures fostering local interests without regard to possible prejudice tononresidents, resulting in a "conflict of commercial regulations, destructive to the harmony of the States." Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 224(Johnson, J., concurring in judgment). Arguably, this was the cause ofthe Constitutional Convention. Ibid. The Commerce Clause not onlygranted Congress express authority to override restrictive and conflicting state commercial regulations, but also effected a curtailment of statepower even absent congressional legislation. Pp. 571-572.(b) The Court is unpersuaded by the Town's arguments that the dormant Commerce Clause is inapplicable here, either because campers are520US2 Unit: $U54 [09-10-99 19:36:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN565Cite as: 520 U. S. 564 (1997)Syllabusnot "articles of commerce," or more generally because interstate commerce is not implicated. The camp is unquestionably engaged in commerce, not only as a purchaser, see, e. g., Katzenbach v. McClung, 379U. S. 294, 300-301, but also as a provider of goods and services akin toa hotel, see, e. g., Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, 379 U. S.241, 244, 258. Although the latter case involved Congress' affirmativepowers, its reasoning is applicable in the dormant Commerce Clausecontext. See, e. g., Hughes v. Oklahoma, 441 U. S. 322, 326, n. 2. TheTown's further argument that the dormant Clause is inapplicable because a real estate tax is at issue is also rejected. Even assuming, asthe Town argues, that Congress could not impose a national real estatetax, States are not free to levy such taxes in a manner that discriminatesagainst interstate commerce. Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, 262 U. S.553, 596. Pp. 572-575.(c) There is no question that if this statute targeted profit-makingentities, it would violate the dormant Commerce Clause. The statutediscriminates on its face against interstate commerce: It expressly distinguishes between entities that serve a principally interstate clienteleand those that primarily serve an intrastate market, singling out campsthat serve mostly in-staters for beneficial tax treatment, and penalizingthose camps that do a principally interstate business. Such laws arevirtually per se invalid. E. g., Fulton Corp. v. Faulkner, 516 U. S. 325,331. Because the Town did not attempt to defend the statute by demonstrating that it advances a legitimate local purpose that cannot beadequately served by reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives, e. g.,Oregon Waste Systems, Inc. v. Department of Environmental Qualityof Ore., 511 U. S. 93, 101, the Court does not address this question. SeeFulton Corp., 516 U. S., at 333-334. Pp. 575-583.(d) The rule applicable to profit-making enterprises also applies toa discriminatory tax exemption for charitable and benevolent institutions. The dormant Commerce Clause's applicability to the nonprofitsector follows from this Court's decisions holding not-for-profit institutions subject to laws regulating commerce, e. g., Associated Press v.NLRB, 301 U. S. 103, 129, and to the federal antitrust laws, e. g., National Collegiate Athletic Assn. v. Board of Regents of Univ. of Okla.,468 U. S. 85, 100, n. 22. The Court has already held that the dormantClause applies to activities not intended to earn a profit, Edwards v.California, 314 U. S. 160, 172, n. 1, and there is no reason why an enterprise's nonprofit character should exclude it from the coverage of eitherthe affirmative or the negative aspect of the Clause, see, e. g., Hughes v.Oklahoma, 441 U. S., at 326, n. 2. Whether operated on a for-profit or520US2 Unit: $U54 [09-10-99 19:36:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN566 CAMPS NEWFOUND/OWATONNA, INC. v. TOWNOF HARRISONSyllabusnonprofit basis, camps such as petitioner's purchase goods and servicesin competitive markets, offer their facilities to a variety of patrons, andderive revenues from a variety of local and out-of-state sources. Anycategorical distinction on the basis of profit is therefore wholly illusory.Pp. 583-588.(e) The Town's arguments that the exemption statute should beviewed as either a legitimate discriminatory subsidy of those charitiesthat focus on local concerns, see, e. g., West Lynn Creamery, Inc. v.Healy, 512 U. S. 186, 199, or alternatively as a governmental "purchase"of charitable services falling within the narrow exception to the dormant Commerce Clause for States in their role as "market participants,"see, e. g., Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap Corp., 426 U. S. 794; Reeves, Inc.v. Stake, 447 U. S. 429, are unpersuasive. Although tax exemptions andsubsidies serve similar ends, they differ in important and relevant respects that preclude approval of the statute at issue. See, e. g., WestLynn, 512 U. S., at 269, 278 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment). Asfor the "market participant" argument, the Court has already rejectedthe Town's position in New Energy Co. of Ind. v. Limbach, 486 U. S. 269,277, and in any event respondents' open-ended exemption is not analogous to the industry-specific state actions approved in AlexandriaScrap and Reeves. Pp. 588-594.(f) This case's facts, viewed in isolation, do not appear to pose anythreat to the national economy's health. Nevertheless, history, including the history of commercial conflict that preceded the ConstitutionalConvention as well as the uniform course of Commerce Clause jurisprudence animated and enlightened by that early history, has shown thateven the smallest discrimination invites significant inroads on nationalsolidarity.

TOWNOF HARRISONOpinion of the CourtThe Maine statute at issue, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 36,$ 652(1)(A) (Supp. 1996), provides a general exemption fromreal estate and personal property taxes for "benevolent andcharitable institutions incorporated" in the State. Withrespect to institutions that are "in fact conducted or oper-ated principally for the benefit of persons who are not residents of Maine," however, a charity may only qualify for amore limited tax benefit, and then only if the weekly chargefor services provided does not exceed $30 per person.$ 652(1)(A)(1).2 Because most of the campers come from out2 The statute provides:"The following property of institutions and organizations is exemptfrom taxation:"1. Property of institutions and organizations."A. The real estate and personal property owned and occupied or usedsolely for their own purposes by benevolent and charitable institutionsincorporated by this State, and none of these may be deprived of the rightof exemption by reason of the source from which its funds are derived orby reason of limitation in the classes of persons for whose benefit suchfunds are applied."(1) Any such institution that is in fact conducted or operated principally for the benefit of persons who are not residents of Maine is entitledto an exemption not to exceed $50,000 of current just value only when thetotal amount of any stipends or charges that it makes or takes during anytax year, as defined by section 502, for its services, benefits or advantagesdivided by the total number of persons receiving such services, benefitsor advantages during the same tax year does not result in an average ratein excess of $30 per week when said weekly rate is computed by dividingthe average yearly charge per person by the total number of weeks in atax year during which such institution is in fact conducted or operatedprincipally for the benefit of persons who are not residents of Maine. Nosuch institution that is in fact conducted or operated principally for thebenefit of persons who are not residents of Maine and makes charges thatresult in an average weekly rate per person, as computed under this subparagraph, in excess of $30 may be entitled to tax exemption.

S. 564 (1997)Opinion of the Courtof State, petitioner could not qualify for a complete exemp-tion.3 And, since the weekly tuition was roughly $400, petitioner was ineligible for any charitable tax exemption at all.In 1992 petitioner made a formal request to the Town fora refund of taxes paid from 1989 through 1991, and a continu-ing exemption from future property taxes, based principallyon a claim that the tax exemption statute violated the Com-merce Clause of the Federal Constitution.4 The request wasdenied, and petitioner filed suit in the Superior Court againstthe Town and its tax assessors and collectors.5 After theboarding homes and boarding care facilities licensed by the Departmentof Human Services pursuant to Title 22, chapter 1665 or its successor,nonprofit community mental health service facilities licensed by the Commissioner of Mental Health, Mental Retardation, and Substance AbuseServices, pursuant to Title 34-B, chapter 3 and nonprofit child care centersincorporated by this State as benevolent and charitable institutions.

Ann.,Tit. 36, $ 652(1)(A) (Supp. 1996).3 The statute's language reserving the property tax exemption for thoseentities operated "principally for the benefit" of Maine residents is notwithout ambiguity. The parties are in agreement, however, that becausepetitioner's camp is attended almost entirely by out-of-staters, it wouldnot qualify for the exemption under any reading of the language. SeeBrief for Petitioner 2; Brief for Respondents 2, n. 3; Tr. of Oral Arg. 36.The courts below appear to have presumed the same, and we of courseaccept their interpretation of state law.4 Petitioner also argued below that the Maine statute violated the EqualProtection Clauses of the United States and Maine Constitutions, and thePrivileges and Immunities Clause, Art. IV, $ 2, of the Federal Constitution.The Maine Supreme Judicial Court had already found the statute constitutional under an equal protection analysis in a prior decision, and adheredto its earlier view. See Green Acre Baha'i Institute v. Eliot, 159 Me. 395,193 A. 2d 564 (1963); 655 A. 2d 876, 879-880 (1995). As for the privilegesand immunities claim, the Supreme Judicial Court found petitioner's argument unavailing. Id., at 880.

TOWNOF HARRISONOpinion of the Courtparties agreed on the relevant facts, they filed cross-motionsfor summary judgment. The Superior Court ruled for petitioner, explaining that under Maine's statute:"Denial of a tax exemption is explicitly and primarilytriggered by engaging in a certain level of interstatecommerce. This denial makes operation of the institu-tions serving non-residents more expensive. This increased cost results from an impermissible distinc-tion between in-state and out-of-state consumers. SeeCommonwealth Edison Co., 453 U. S., at 617-19. . . .Maine's charitable tax exemption is denied, not becausethere is a difference between the activities of charitableinstitutions serving residents and non-residents, but because of the residency of the people whom the institu-tions serve." App. to Pet. for Cert. 14a-15a (footnoteomitted).The Town, but not the State, appealed and the Maine Su-preme Judicial Court reversed. 655 A. 2d 876 (1995). Noting that a Maine statute 6 characterized tax exemptions as"tax expenditures," it viewed the exemption for charitableinstitutions as the equivalent of a purchase of their services.Id., at 878. Because the exemption statute "treats all Mainecharities alike"--given the fact that "all have the opportunity to qualify for an exemption by choosing to dispense themajority of their charity locally"--it "regulates evenhandedly with only incidental effects on interstate commerce."Id., at 879. In the absence of evidence that petitioner'scamp "competes with other summer camps outside of orwithin Maine," or that the statute "impedes interstatetravel" or that it "provides services that are necessary forinterstate travel," the Court concluded that petitioner hadState did not appeal the adverse decision of the Superior Court and, therefore, is not a respondent in this Court.

For the reasonsthat follow, we now reverse.IIDuring the first years of our history as an independentconfederation, the National Government lacked the power toregulate commerce among the States. Because each Statewas free to adopt measures fostering its own local interestswithout regard to possible prejudice to nonresidents, whatJustice Johnson characterized as a "conflict of commercialregulations, destructive to the harmony of the States," en-sued. SeeGibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 224 (1824) (opinionconcurring in judgment). In his view, this "was the immediate cause that led to the forming of a [constitutional] conven-tion."Ibid. "If there was any one object riding overevery other in the adoption of the constitution, it was to keepthe commercial intercourse among the States free from allinvidious and partial restraints." Id., at 231.7We have subsequently endorsed Justice Johnson's ap-praisal of the central importance of federal control over interstate and foreign commerce and, more narrowly, his con-clusion that the Commerce Clause had not only grantedCongress express authority to override restrictive and con-flicting commercial regulations adopted by the States, butthat it also had immediately effected a curtailment of statepower. "In short, the Commerce Clause even without implementing legislation by Congress is a limitation upon thepower of the States.Southern Pacific Co. v.

Our decisions on this point reflect, "upon fullest con-sideration, the course of adjudication unbroken through theNation's history." Ibid. See also H. P. Hood & Sons, Inc.v. Du Mond, 336 U. S. 525, 534-535 (1949). Although Con-gress unquestionably has the power to repudiate or substantially modify that course of adjudication,8 it has not done so.This case involves an issue that we have not previouslyaddressed--the disparate real estate tax treatment of a non-profit service provider based on the residence of the consumers that it serves. The Town argues that our dormantCommerce Clause jurisprudence is wholly inapplicable tothis case, because interstate commerce is not implicated hereand Congress has no power to enact a tax on real estate.We first reject these arguments, and then explain why wethink our prior cases make it clear that if profit-making en-terprises were at issue, Maine could not tax petitioner moreheavily than other camp operators simply because its camp-ers come principally from other States. We next addressthe novel question whether a different rule should apply toa discriminatory tax exemption for charitable and benevolentinstitutions. Finally, we reject the Town's argument thatthe exemption should either be viewed as a permissible subsidy or as a purchase of services by the State acting as a"market participant." IIIWe are unpersuaded by the Town's argument that thedormant Commerce Clause is inapplicable here, either because campers are not "articles of commerce" or, more gen-erally, because the camp's "product is delivered and `consumed' entirely within Maine."

Even though petitioner's camp does not make aprofit, it is unquestionably engaged in commerce, not only asa purchaser, see Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U. S. 294, 300-301 (1964); United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, 558 (1995),but also as a provider of goods and services. It marketsthose services, together with an opportunity to enjoy thenatural beauty of an inland lake in Maine, to campers whoare attracted to its facility from all parts of the Nation. Therecord reflects that petitioner "advertises for campers in[out-of-state] periodicals . . . and sends its Executive Director annually on camper recruiting trips across the country."App. 49-50. Petitioner's efforts are quite successful; 95 percent of its campers come from out of State. The attendanceof these campers necessarily generates the transportation ofpersons across state lines that has long been recognized as aform of "commerce." Edwards v. California, 314 U. S. 160,172 (1941); see also Caminetti v. United States, 242 U. S. 470,491 (1917); Hoke v. United States, 227 U. S. 308, 320 (1913).Summer camps are comparable to hotels that offer theirguests goods and services that are consumed locally. InHeart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, 379 U. S. 241(1964), we recognized that interstate commerce is substantially affected by the activities of a hotel that "solicitspatronage from outside the State of Georgia through variousnational advertising media, including magazines of nationalcirculation." Id., at 243. In that case, we held that commerce was substantially affected by private race discrimination that limited access to the hotel and thereby impededinterstate commerce in the form of travel. Id., at 244, 258;see Lopez, 514 U. S., at 558-559. Official discrimination thatlimits the access of nonresidents to summer camps creates asimilar impediment. Even when business activities arepurely local, if " `it is interstate commerce that feels thepinch, it does not matter how local the operation which applies the squeeze.' " Heart of Atlanta, 379 U.

S. 460, 464 (1949)).Although Heart of Atlanta involved Congress' affirmativeCommerce Clause powers, its reasoning is applicable here.As we stated in Hughes v. Oklahoma, 441 U. S. 322 (1979):"The definition of `commerce' is the same when relied on tostrike down or restrict state legislation as when relied on tosupport some exertion of federal control or regulation." Id.,at 326, n. 2. That case in turn rested upon our reasoning inPhiladelphia v. New Jersey, 437 U. S. 617 (1978), in whichwe rejected a "two-tiered definition of commerce."Id., at622. "Just as Congress ha[d] power to regulate the interstate movement of [the] wastes" at issue in that case, so toowe held were States "not free from constitutional scrutinywhen they restrict that movement." Id., at 622-623. Seealso Sporhase v. Nebraska ex rel. Douglas, 458 U. S. 941,953 (1982).The Town's arguments that the dormant Commerce Clauseis inapplicable to petitioner because the campers are not "articles of commerce," or more generally that interstate commerce is not at issue here, are therefore unpersuasive. Theservices that petitioner provides to its principally out-ofstate campers clearly have a substantial effect on commerce,as do state restrictions on making those services available tononresidents. Cf. C & A Carbone, Inc. v. Clarkstown, 511U. S. 383, 391 (1994).The Town also argues that the dormant Commerce Clauseis inapplicable because a real estate tax is at issue. We disagree. A tax on real estate, like any other tax, may impermissibly burden interstate commerce. We may assume asthe Town argues (though the question is not before us) thatCongress could not impose a national real estate tax. Itdoes not follow that the States may impose real estate taxesin a manner that discriminates against interstate commerce.A State's "power to lay and collect taxes, comprehensive andnecessary as that power is, cannot be exerted in a way which520US2 Unit: $U54 [09-10-99 19:36:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN575Cite as: 520 U. S. 564 (1997)Opinion of the Courtinvolves a discrimination against [interstate] commerce."Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, 262 U. S. 553, 596 (1923).To allow a State to avoid the strictures of the dormantCommerce Clause by the simple device of labeling its discriminatory tax a levy on real estate would destroy the bar-rier against protectionism that the Constitution provides.We noted in West Lynn Creamery, Inc. v. Healy, 512 U. S.186 (1994), that "[t]he paradigmatic . . . law discriminatingagainst interstate commerce is the protective [import] tariffor customs duty, which taxes goods imported from otherStates, but does not tax similar products produced in State."Id., at 193. Such tariffs are "so patently unconstitutionalthat our cases reveal not a single attempt by a State to enactone." Ibid. Yet, were the Town's theory adopted, a Statecould create just such a tariff with ease. The State wouldneed only to pass a statute imposing a special real estate taxon property used to store, process, or sell imported goods.By gearing the increased tax to the value of the importedgoods at issue, the State could create the functional equivalent of an import tariff. As this example demonstrates, toaccept the Town's theory would have radical and unacceptable results.We therefore turn to the question whether our prior casespreclude a State from imposing a higher tax on a camp thatserves principally nonresidents than on one that limits itsservices primarily to residents.IVThere is no question that were this statute targeted atprofit-making entities, it would violate the dormant Commerce Clause. "State laws discriminating against interstatecommerce on their face are `virtually per se invalid.' " Fulton Corp. v. Faulkner, 516 U. S. 325, 331 (1996) (quoting Ore-gon Waste Systems, Inc. v. Department of EnvironmentalQuality of Ore., 511 U. S. 93, 99 (1994)). It is not necessaryto look beyond the text of this statute to determine that it520US2 Unit: $U54 [09-10-99 19:36:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN576 CAMPS NEWFOUND/OWATONNA, INC. v. TOWNOF HARRISONOpinion of the Courtdiscriminates against interstate commerce. The Maine lawexpressly distinguishes between entities that serve a principally interstate clientele and those that primarily serve anintrastate market, singling out camps that serve mostly instaters for beneficial tax treatment, and penalizing thosecamps that do a principally interstate business. As a practical matter, the statute encourages affected entities to limittheir out-of-state clientele, and penalizes the principally nonresident customers of businesses catering to a primarily in-terstate market.If such a policy were implemented by a statutory prohibition against providing camp services to nonresidents, thestatute would almost certainly be invalid. We have "con-sistently . . . held that the Commerce Clause . . . precludes astate from mandating that its residents be given a preferredright of access, over out-of-state consumers, to natural resources located within its borders or to the products derivedtherefrom."New England Power Co. v. New Hampshire,455 U. S. 331, 338 (1982). Our authorities on this point dateto the early part of the century.9 Petitioner's "product" is9 In West v. Kansas Natural Gas Co., 221 U. S. 229 (1911), we held invalidunder the Commerce Clause an Oklahoma statute that had the effect ofpreventing out-of-state consumers from purchasing Oklahoma natural gas.We ruled similarly in Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, 262 U. S. 553 (1923),that a West Virginia statute limiting out-of-state users' access to WestVirginia gas to that not "required to meet the local needs for all purposes,"id., at 594, violated the Commerce Clause. We found those cases directlyanalogous in New England Power, ruling invalid a state law that reservedfor state citizens domestically generated hydroelectric power. In Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 437 U. S. 617 (1978), we struck down a New Jerseystatute prohibiting certain categories of out-of-state waste from flowinginto the State's landfills, noting that "a State may not accord its own inhabitants a preferred right of access over consumers in other States to naturalresources located within its borders." Id., at 627. And, in Hughes v.Oklahoma, 441 U. S., at 338, we ruled that a statute prohibiting the exportof minnows for sale out of State violated the Commerce Clause. We heldsimilarly in Sporhase v. Nebraska ex rel. Douglas, 458 U. S. 941, 958 (1982),that a provision preventing the export of ground water to States notallowing reciprocal export rights was an impermissible barrier to com520US2 Unit: $U54 [09-10-99 19:36:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN577Cite as: 520 U. S. 564 (1997)Opinion of the Courtin part the natural beauty of Maine itself and, in addition,the special services that the camp provides. In this way, theMaine statute is like a law that burdens out-of-state access todomestically generated hydroelectric power, New EnglandPower, or to local landfills, Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 437U. S. 617 (1978). In those cases, as in this case, the burdenfell on out-of-state access both to a natural resource and torelated services provided by state residents.10Avoiding this sort of "economic Balkanization," Hughes v.Oklahoma, 441 U. S., at 325, and the retaliatory acts of otherStates that may follow, is one of the central purposes of ournegative Commerce Clause jurisprudence. See ibid.; Westv. Kansas Natural Gas Co., 221 U. S. 229, 255 (1911) (expressing concern that "embargo may be retaliated by em-bargo, and commerce will be halted at state lines"). And,as we noted in Brown-Forman Distillers Corp. v. New YorkState Liquor Authority, 476 U. S. 573, 580 (1986): "Economicprotectionism is not limited to attempts to convey advanmerce. Insofar as Sporhase suggests certain narrow circumstances inwhich the reservation of natural resources for state citizens may be permissible, see id., at 956-957, these concerns are not implicated here.10 We have long noted the applicability of our dormant Commerce Clausejurisprudence to service industries. See, e. g., C & A Carbone, Inc. v.Clarkstown, 511 U. S. 383, 391 (1994) ("[T]he article of commerce is notso much the solid waste itself, but rather the service of processing anddisposing of it"); Fort Gratiot Sanitary Landfill, Inc. v. Michigan Dept.of Natural Resources, 504 U. S. 353, 359 (1992) (noting that "arrangementsbetween out-of-state generators of waste and the . . . operator of a wastedisposal site" may be "viewed as `sales' of garbage or `purchases' of transportation and disposal services"); Boston Stock Exchange v. State TaxComm'n, 429 U. S. 318, 337 (1977) ("[N]o State may discriminatorily tax. . . the business operations performed in any other State"); Lewis v. BTInvestment Managers, Inc., 447 U. S. 27, 42 (1980) (striking down statestatute under dormant Commerce Clause that favored in-state over outof-state entities in the investor services market). Given the substantialportion of the national economy now devoted to service industries, seeBureau of Census, Statistical Abstract of the United States 1995, p. 779(Table 1288) (noting service industries constituted approximately 20 percent of gross domestic product in 1992), this is a natural development inour dormant Commerce Clause jurisprudence.520US2 Unit: $U54 [09-10-99 19:36:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN578 CAMPS NEWFOUND/OWATONNA, INC. v. TOWNOF HARRISONOpinion of the Courttages on local merchants; it may include attempts to givelocal consumers an advantage over consumers in otherStates." 11 By encouraging economic isolationism, prohibi-tions on out-of-state access to in-state resources serve thevery evil that the dormant Commerce Clause was designedto prevent.Of course, this case does not involve a total prohibition.Rather, the statute provides a strong incentive for affectedentities not to do business with nonresidents if they are ableto so avoid the discriminatory tax. In this way, the statuteis similar to the North Carolina "intangibles tax" that westruck down inFulton Corp. v. Faulkner, 516 U. S., at 327.That case involved the constitutionality under the CommerceClause of a state "regime that taxe[d] stock [held by in-stateshareholders] only to the degree that its issuing corporationparticipates in interstate commerce." Id., at 333. We heldthe statute facially discriminatory, in part because it tended"to discourage domestic corporations from plying theirtrades in interstate commerce."Ibid. Maine's statute hasa like effect.To the extent that affected Maine organizations are notdeterred by the statute from doing a principally interstatebusiness, it is clear that discriminatory burdens on interstatecommerce imposed by regulation or taxation may also violate the Commerce Clause. We have held that special feesassessed on nonresidents directly by the State when theyattempt to use local services impose an impermissible burdenon interstate commerce. See, e. g., Chemical Waste Management, Inc. v. Hunt, 504 U. S. 334, 342 (1992) (discrimina-tory tax imposed on disposal of out-of-state hazardouswaste). That the tax discrimination comes in the form of adeprivation of a generally available tax benefit, rather than11 The Town argues that "the Commerce Clause protects out-of-statecompetitors but does not protect out-of state consumers." Brief for Respondents 16. As the discussion above indicates, our cases have rejectedthis view.520US2 Unit: $U54 [09-10-99 19:36:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN579Cite as: 520 U. S. 564 (1997)Opinion of the Courta specific penalty on the activity itself, is of no moment.Thus, in New Energy Co. of Ind. v. Limbach, 486 U. S. 269,274 (1988), the Court invalidated an Ohio statute that pro-vided a tax credit for sales of ethanol produced in State, butnot ethanol produced in certain other States; the law "de-prive[d] certain products of generally available beneficial taxtreatment because they are made in certain other States,and thus on its face appear[ed] to violate the cardinal requirement of nondiscrimination." 12 Given the fact that theburden of Maine's facially discriminatory tax scheme fallsby design in a predictably disproportionate way on out-of-staters,13 the pernicious effect on interstate commerce is12 See Bacchus Imports, Ltd. v. Dias, 468 U. S. 263, 268 (1984) (discriminatory excise tax exemption); Maryland v. Louisiana, 451 U. S. 725, 756(1981) (tax scheme "unquestionably discriminates against interstate commerce . . . as the necessary result of various tax credits and exclusions");Westinghouse Elec. Corp. v. Tully, 466 U. S. 388, 399-400, and n. 9 (1984)(per curiam); see also West Lynn Creamery, Inc. v. Healy, 512 U. S., at210 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment).13 Because the Maine tax is facially discriminatory, this case is unlikeCommonwealth Edison Co. v. Montana, 453 U. S. 609 (1981). There, weheld permissible under the Commerce Clause a generally applicable Montana severance tax on coal extracted from in-state mines. Appellantschallenged the tax arguing, inter alia, that it discriminated against interstate commerce because 90 percent of the coal happened to be shipped toout-of-state users, and the tax burden was therefore borne principally bynonresidents. We rejected this claim, noting that "there is no real discrimination in this case; the tax burden is borne according to the amountof coal consumed and not according to any distinction between in-state andout-of-state consumers." Id., at 619. We recognized that an approach tothe dormant Commerce Clause requiring an assessment of the likely demand for a particular good by nonresidents and a State's ability to shiftits tax burden out of State "would require complex factual inquiries aboutsuch issues as elasticity of demand for the product and alternative sourcesof supply," id., at 619, n. 8, and declined to adopt such a difficult to policetest. Here, in contrast, the tax scheme functions by design and on itsface to burden out-of-state users disproportionately. Our analysis inCommonwealth Edison is therefore inapplicable.CTS Corp. v. Dynamics Corp. of America, 481 U. S. 69 (1987), is alsoinapposite. In that case, we rejected the argument that a facially nondis520US2 Unit: $U54 [09-10-99 19:36:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN580 CAMPS NEWFOUND/OWATONNA, INC. v. TOWNOF HARRISONOpinion of the Courtthe same as in our cases involving taxes targeting out-of-staters alone.Unlike in Chemical Waste, we recognize that here the dis-criminatory burden is imposed on the out-of-state customerindirectly by means of a tax on the entity transacting business with the non-Maine customer. This distinction makesno analytic difference. As we noted inWest Lynn Creamerydiscussing the general phenomenon of import tariffs: "Forover 150 years, our cases have rightly concluded that theimposition of a differential burden on any part of the streamof commerce--from wholesaler to retailer to consumer--isinvalid, because a burden placed at any point will result in adisadvantage to the out-of-state producer." 512 U. S., at 202(citing cases). So too here, it matters little that it is thecamp that is taxed rather than the campers. The recorddemonstrates that the economic incidence of the tax falls atleast in part on the campers, the Town has not contestedthe point, and the courts below based their decision on thispresumption. App. 49; 655 A. 2d, at 879; App. to Pet. forCert. 14a, n. 2.14With respect to those businesses--like petitioner's--thatcontinue to engage in a primarily interstate trade, the Mainestatute therefore functionally serves as an export tariff thattargets out-of-state consumers by taxing the businesses thatcriminatory state law deterring hostile tender offers violated the dormantCommerce Clause because most such offers "are launched by offerors outside Indiana." Id., at 88. We explained that "nothing in the . . . Actimposes a greater burden on out-of-state offerors than it does on similarlysituated Indiana offerors." Ibid. (emphasis added). Here, the discrimination appears on the face of the Maine statute. Exxon Corp. v. Governorof Maryland, 437 U. S. 117 (1978), is similarly distinguishable. See id., at126 ("The fact that the burden of a state regulation falls on some interstate companies does not, by itself, establish a claim of discriminationagainst interstate commerce").14 We therefore have no need to consider these matters further. Cf.Fulton Corp. v. Faulkner, 516 U. S. 325, 341 (1996) (noting "complexity ofeconomic incidence analysis").520US2 Unit: $U54 [09-10-99 19:36:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN581Cite as: 520 U. S. 564 (1997)Opinion of the Courtprincipally serve them. As our cases make clear, this sortof discrimination is at the very core of activities forbiddenby the dormant Commerce Clause. " `[A] State may not taxa transaction or incident more heavily when it crosses statelines than when it occurs entirely within the State.' "Chemical Waste, 504 U. S., at 342 (quoting Armco Inc. v.Hardesty, 467 U. S. 638, 642 (1984)); see West Lynn Creamery, Inc. v. Healy, 512 U. S., at 193 (tariffs forbidden by thedormant Commerce Clause).Ninety-five percent of petitioner's campers come from outof State. Insofar as Maine's discriminatory tax has increased tuition, that burden is felt almost entirely by outof-staters, deterring them from enjoying the benefits ofcamping in Maine.15 In sum, the Maine statute facially discriminates against interstate commerce, and is all but per seinvalid. See, e. g., Oregon Waste, 511 U. S., at 100-101.We recognize that the Town might have attempted to defend the Maine law under the per se rule by demonstratingthat it " `advances a legitimate local purpose that cannot beadequately served by reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives.' " Id., at 101 (quoting New Energy Co., 486 U. S., at278). In assessing respondents' arguments, we would haveapplied our "strictest scrutiny." Hughes v. Oklahoma, 44115 The Town argues that these effects are entirely speculative, becausethe record does not reflect any decision by a potential camper not to attendpetitioner's camp as a result of the burden imposed. Brief for Respondents 16. The Supreme Judicial Court appears to have adopted similarreasoning. 655 A. 2d, at 879. This misconstrues the proper analysis.As we made clear most recently in Fulton Corp. v. Faulkner, 516 U. S., at333, n. 3, there is no " `de minimis' defense to a charge of discriminatorytaxation under the Commerce Clause." A particularized showing of thesort respondent seeks is not required. See Associated Industries of Mo.v. Lohman, 511 U. S. 641, 650 (1994) ("[A]ctual discrimination, wherever itis found, is impermissible, and the magnitude and scope of the discrimination have no bearing on the determinative question whether discrimination has occurred"); Maryland v. Louisiana, 451 U. S., at 756; see alsoBoston Stock Exchange v. State Tax Comm'n, 429 U. S., at 334, n. 13.520US2 Unit: $U54 [09-10-99 19:36:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN582 CAMPS NEWFOUND/OWATONNA, INC. v. TOWNOF HARRISONOpinion of the CourtU. S., at 337. This is an extremely difficult burden, "soheavy that `facial discrimination by itself may be a fatal defect.' " Oregon Waste, 511 U. S., at 101 (quoting Hughes, 441U. S., at 337); see Chemical Waste Management, Inc. v.Hunt, 504 U. S., at 342 ("Once a state tax is found to discrimi-nate against out-of-state commerce, it is typically struckdown without further inquiry"). Perhaps realizing theweight of its burden, the Town has made no effort to defendthe statute under the per se rule, and so we do not addressthis question. SeeFulton Corp. v. Faulkner, 516 U. S., at333-334.16 We have no doubt that if petitioner's camp were16 Justice Scalia submits that we err by following our precedent inFulton and declining to address an argument that the Town itself did notthink worthy of pressing. Post, at 602-603. But even if there were reason to consider the State's compliance with the per se rule, the Town wouldnot prevail. In the single case Justice Scalia points to in which wefound the per se standard to have been met, Maine v. Taylor, 477 U. S.131 (1986), the State had no " `reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives,' "Oregon Waste, 511 U. S., at 101 (quoting New Energy Co., 486 U. S., at278), to the action it had taken. Absent a bar on the import of certainminnows, there was no way for Maine to protect its natural environmentfrom the hazard of parasites and nonnative species that might have beenaccidentally introduced into the State's waters. Taylor, 477 U. S., at 141.In contrast, here Maine has ample alternatives short of a facially discriminatory property tax exemption to achieve its apparent goal of subsidizing the attendance of the State's children at summer camp. Mainecould, for example, achieve this end by offering direct financial support toparents of resident children. Cf. Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U. S. 618(1969). Though we have not had the occasion to address the issue, itmight also be permissible for the State to subsidize Maine camps directlyto the extent that they serve residents. See West Lynn Creamery, Inc.v. Healy, 512 U. S., at 199, n. 15; New Energy Co. of Ind. v. Limbach, 486U. S. 269, 278 (1988) (noting that "[d]irect subsidization of domestic industry does not ordinarily run afoul" of the Commerce Clause); Hughesv. Alexandria Scrap Corp., 426 U. S., at 816 (Stevens, J., concurring).While the Town does argue its case under the less exacting analysis setforth in, e. g., Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U. S. 137, 142 (1970), "thislesser scrutiny is only available `where other [nondiscriminatory] legislative objectives are credibly advanced and there is no patent discrimination520US2 Unit: $U54 [09-10-99 19:36:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN583Cite as: 520 U. S. 564 (1997)Opinion of the Courta profit-making entity, the discriminatory tax exemptionwould be impermissible.VThe unresolved question presented by this case is whethera different rule should apply to tax exemptions for charitableand benevolent institutions. Though we have never hadcause to address the issue directly, the applicability of thedormant Commerce Clause to the nonprofit sector of theeconomy follows from our prior decisions.Our cases have frequently applied laws regulating commerce to not-for-profit institutions. In Associated Press v.NLRB, 301 U. S. 103 (1937), for example, we held the Na-tional Labor Relations Act as applied to the AssociatedPress' (A. P.'s) newsgathering activities to be an enactmententirely within Congress' Commerce Clause power, despitethe fact that the A. P. "does not sell news and does not oper-ate for a profit."Id., at 129. Noting that the A. P.'s activities "involve[d] the constant use of channels of interstate andforeign communication," we concluded that its operations"amount[ed] to commercial intercourse, and such intercourseis commerce within the meaning of the Constitution." Id.,against interstate trade.' " Chemical Waste, 504 U. S., at 343, n. 5 (quoting Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 437 U. S., at 624 (emphasis added)). Because the Maine statute is facially discriminatory, the more deferentialstandard is inapplicable. Contrary to Justice Scalia's suggestion, thiscase is quite unlike General Motors Corp. v. Tracy, 519 U. S. 278 (1997).There, the Court premised its holding that the statute at issue was notfacially discriminatory on the view that sellers of "bundled" and "unbundled" natural gas were principally competing in different markets. Seeid., at 297-298, 300 ("dormant Commerce Clause protects markets and participants in markets, not taxpayers as such"). While it may be true that"[d]isparate treatment constitutes discrimination only if the objects ofthe disparate treatment are . . . similarly situated," post, at 601, there is noquestion that the statute at issue here is facially discriminatory becauseit disparately treats identically situated Maine nonprofit camps dependingupon whether they favor in-state, as opposed to out-of-state, campers.520US2 Unit: $U54 [09-10-99 19:36:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN584 CAMPS NEWFOUND/OWATONNA, INC. v. TOWNOF HARRISONOpinion of the Courtat 128. See also Polish National Alliance of United Statesv.NLRB, 322 U. S. 643 (1944).We have similarly held that federal antitrust laws areapplicable to the anticompetitive activities of nonprofit organizations. See National Collegiate Athletic Assn. v. Boardof Regents of Univ. of Okla., 468 U. S. 85, 100, n. 22 (1984)(Sherman Act $ 1 applies to nonprofits);American Soc. ofMechanical Engineers, Inc. v. Hydrolevel Corp., 456 U. S.556, 576 (1982) ("[I]t is beyond debate that nonprofit organizations can be held liable under the antitrust laws"); Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, 421 U. S. 773 (1975). The nonprofit character of an enterprise does not place it beyondthe purview of federal laws regulating commerce. See alsoNLRB v. Yeshiva Univ., 444 U. S. 672, 681, n. 11 (1980) (noting that in context of amendments to National Labor Re-lations Act "Congress appears to have agreed that nonprofit institutions `affect commerce' under modern economicconditions").We have already held that the dormant Commerce Clauseis applicable to activities undertaken without the intentionof earning a profit. In Edwards v. California, 314 U. S. 160(1941), we addressed the constitutionality of a Californiastatute prohibiting the transport into that State of indigentpersons. We struck the statute down as a violation of thedormant Commerce Clause, reasoning that "the transportation of persons is `commerce,' " and that the Californiastatute was an "unconstitutional barrier to [that] interstatecommerce." Id., at 172-173. In determining whether thetransportation of persons is "commerce," we noted that "[i]tis immaterial whether or not the transportation is commercial in character." Id., at 172, n. 1.We see no reason why the nonprofit character of an enterprise should exclude it from the coverage of either the affirmative or the negative aspect of the Commerce Clause.See Hughes, 441 U. S., at 326, n. 2; Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 437 U. S., at 621-623 (rejecting "two-tiered definition ofcommerce"); Sporhase, 458 U.

There are a number of lines of commerce in whichboth for-profit and nonprofit entities participate. Some educational institutions, some hospitals, some child care facilities,some research organizations, and some museums generatesignificant earnings; and some are operated by not-for-profitcorporations. See Hansmann, The Role of Nonprofit Enterprise, 89 Yale L. J. 835, 835, and n. 1, 865 (1980).A nonprofit entity is ordinarily understood to differ froma for-profit corporation principally because it "is barred fromdistributing its net earnings, if any, to individuals who exercise control over it, such as members, officers, directors, ortrustees."Id., at 838.17 Nothing intrinsic to the nature ofnonprofit entities prevents them from engaging in interstatecommerce. Summer camps may be operated as for-profit ornonprofit entities; nonprofits may depend--as here--in substantial part on fees charged for their services. Clotfelter,The Distributional Consequences of Nonprofit Activities, inWho Benefits from the Nonprofit Sector? 1, 6 (C. Clotfeltered. 1992) (nonprofits in some sectors are "heavily dependenton fees by paying customers, with private payments account-ing for at least half of total revenues"). Whether operatedon a for-profit or nonprofit basis, they purchase goods and17 Maine's law governing nonprofits embraces this conception, see Me.Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 13-B, $ 102(9) (1981), as does the tax exemption statute at issue here. The exemption applies to "benevolent and charitableinstitutions." Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 36, $ 652(1)(A) (Supp. 1996). Toqualify, the entity must devote "[a]ll profits derived from [its] operation. . . and the proceeds from the sale of its property . . . exclusively to thepurposes for which it is organized." $ 652(1)(C)(3). "A director, trustee,officer or employee of an organization claiming exemption is not entitledto receive directly or indirectly any pecuniary profit from the operationof that organization, excepting reasonable compensation for services ineffecting its purposes." $ 652(1)(C)(2). The statute also expressly designates certain categories of entities (nonprofit nursing homes, boardinghomes, community mental health service facilities, and child care centers)that qualify for tax exempt status under federal law, 26 U. S. C. $ 501(c)(3),as falling within its ambit. See Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 36, $ 652(1)(A)(Supp. 1996) (" `[B]enevolent and charitable institutions' include, but arenot limited to, [the specified entities]").520US2 Unit: $U54 [09-10-99 19:36:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN586 CAMPS NEWFOUND/OWATONNA, INC. v.

And, although the summer camp involved inthis case may have a relatively insignificant impact on thecommerce of the entire Nation, the interstate commercialactivities of nonprofit entities as a class are unquestionablysignificant.18 See Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U. S. 111, 127-128 (1942); Lopez, 514 U.

V. Hodgkinson, M. Weitzman, C. Toppe, & S. Noga,Nonprofit Almanac 1992-1993: Dimensions of the Independent Sector 29(1992) (Table 1.5).Justice Scalia wrongly suggests that Maine's law offers only a "narrow tax exemption," post, at 598, which he implies has no substantial effecton interstate commerce and serves only "to relieve the State of its burdenof caring for its residents," post, at 596. This characterization is quitemisleading. The statute expressly exempts from tax property used bysuch important nonprofit service industries as nursing homes and childcare centers. See Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 36, $ 652(1)(A)(1) (Supp. 1996).Nonprofit participation in these sectors is substantial. Nationally, nonprofit nursing homes had estimated revenues of $18 billion in 1994. U. S.Bureau of the Census, Service Annual Survey: 1994 (1996) (Table 7.3).These entities compete with a sizeable for-profit nursing home sector,which had revenues of approximately $40 billion in 1994. Id., at Table7.1. Similarly, the $5 billion nonprofit market in child day care servicescompetes with an $11 billion for-profit industry. Id., at Tables 8.1, 8.3(1994 data).Nonprofit hospitals and health maintenance organizations also receivean exemption from Maine's property tax. See Me. Rev. Stat.

While operating as nonprofit entities,their activities are serious business. In Maine Medical Center v. Lucci,317 A. 2d 1 (1974), the Supreme Judicial Court presumed that a "largehospital" employing 2,000 people qualified as a "benevolent and charitableinstitution" for purposes of the $ 652(1)(A) exemption, and held that anewly constructed $3.3 million parking facility--which patients, visitors,and staff were charged a fee to use--was also exempt from the tax.Though the garage was being operated at an immediate loss, "projectedestimates of income and expense indicated a possible recovery of the capital investment over a period of twenty years." Id., at 2. Nonprofit hospitals had national revenues of roughly $305 billion in 1994, considerablymore than the $34 billion in revenues collected by hospitals operated on afor-profit basis. U. S. Bureau of the Census, Service Annual Survey: 1994(1996) (Tables 7.1, 7.3).Maine law further permits qualifying nonprofits to rent out their property on a commercial basis at market rates in order to support other activities, so long as that use of the property is only incidental to their ownpurposes. See Maine Medical Center, 317 A. 2d, at 2 (citing with approval Curtis v. Androscoggin Lodge, No. 24, Independent Order of OddFellows, 99 Me. 356, 360, 59 A. 518, 520 (1904)); State Young Men's Christian Assn. v. Winthrop, 295 A. 2d 440, 442 (Me. 1972). Although Maine'stax exemption statute was amended in 1953 to specify that the propertyneed not be occupied by the charity to qualify for the exemption, but mayalso be "used solely" for its own purposes, see ibid., this extension did notalter the "well defined rul[e] of exemption" permitting "occasional orpurely incidental" renting. Green Acre Baha'i Institute, 150 Me., at 354,110 A. 2d, at 584; see also Alpha Rho Zeta of Lambda Chi Alpha, Inc. v.Waterville, 477 A. 2d 1131, 1141 (Me. 1984). But cf. Nature Conservancyof the Pine Tree State, Inc. v. Bristol, 385 A. 2d 39, 43 (Me. 1978) (holdingthat requirement that property be used "solely" for institution's own purposes prohibits tax exemption where grantor of property to charity maintains private rights of use). Maine's statute expressly contemplates thatentities receiving the benefit of the tax exemption may well earn profits,though of course these must be plowed back into the enterprise or otherwise appropriately used. See Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 36, $ 652(1)(C)(3)(Supp. 1996).520US2 Unit: $U54 [09-10-99 19:36:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN588 CAMPS NEWFOUND/OWATONNA, INC. v. TOWNOF HARRISONOpinion of the Courtstitutions participate. Indeed, if we view the issue solelyfrom the State's perspective, it is equally reasonable to usediscriminatory tax exemptions as a means of encouraging thegrowth of local trade. But as our cases clearly hold, suchexemptions are impermissible. See, e. g., Bacchus Imports,Ltd. v. Dias, 468 U. S. 263, 273 (1984). Protectionism,whether targeted at for-profit entities or serving, as here, toencourage nonprofits to keep their efforts close to home, isforbidden under the dormant Commerce Clause.19 If thereis need for a special exception for nonprofits, Congress notonly has the power to create it,20 but also is in a far betterposition than we to determine its dimensions.21VIRather than urging us to create a categorical exception fornonprofit entities, the Town argues that Maine's exemptionstatute should be viewed as an expenditure of governmentmoney designed to lessen its social service burden and tofoster the societal benefits provided by charitable organiza-tions. So characterized, the Town submits that its tax exemption scheme is either a legitimate discriminatory subsidy19 Contrary to Justice Scalia's suggestion, nothing in our holdingtoday "prevent[s] a State from giving a tax break to charities that benefitthe State's inhabitants." Post, at 595. The States are, of course, freeto provide generally applicable nondiscriminatory tax exemptions withoutrunning afoul of the dormant Commerce Clause.20 See n. 8, supra.21 We must admit to some puzzlement as to the force of the argumentunderlying Justice Scalia's dissent. On the one hand, he suggests thata categorical exemption of nonprofit activities from dormant CommerceClause scrutiny would be proper. Post, at 607-608. Yet at the sametime, he makes a great effort to characterize this statute as being so narrow that, whatever the appropriate generally applicable rule, the dormantCommerce Clause ought not to apply here. Post, at 598. As we haveexplained, the argument in favor of a categorical exemption for nonprofitsis unpersuasive, and we disagree with Justice Scalia's characterizationof this statute's effects. Accordingly, we reject his position on either ofthese theories.520US2 Unit: $U54 [09-10-99 19:36:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN589Cite as: 520 U. S. 564 (1997)Opinion of the Courtof only those charities that choose to focus their activities onlocal concerns, or alternatively a governmental "purchase"of charitable services falling within the narrow exception tothe dormant Commerce Clause for States in their role as"market participants," see, e. g., Hughes v. Alexandria ScrapCorp., 426 U. S. 794 (1976); Reeves, Inc. v. Stake, 447 U. S.429 (1980). We find these arguments unpersuasive. Although tax exemptions and subsidies serve similar ends, theydiffer in important and relevant respects, and our cases haverecognized these distinctions. As for the "market partici-pant" argument, we have already rejected the Town's position in a prior case, and in any event respondents' openended exemption for charitable and benevolent institutionsis not analogous to the industry-specific state actions that wereviewed in Alexandria Scrap and Reeves.The Town argues that its discriminatory tax exemption is,in economic reality, no different from a discriminatory sub-sidy of those charities that cater principally to local needs.Noting our statement in West Lynn Creamery that "[a] puresubsidy funded out of general revenue ordinarily imposes noburden on interstate commerce, but merely assists local business," 512 U. S., at 199, the Town submits that since a dis-criminatory subsidy may be permissible, a discriminatory exemption must be, too. We have "never squarely confrontedthe constitutionality of subsidies,"id., at 199, n. 15, and weneed not address these questions today. Assuming, arguendo, that the Town is correct that a direct subsidy benefiting only those nonprofits serving principally Maine residentswould be permissible, our cases do not sanction a tax exemption serving similar ends.2222 As the Supreme Judicial Court made clear, 655 A. 2d, at 878, underMaine law an exemption is categorized as a "tax expenditure." Me. Rev.Stat. Ann., Tit. 36, $ 196 (1990). The Town's effort to argue that this statestatutory categorization allows it to elide the federal constitutional distinction between tax exemptions and subsidies is unavailing. We recognizedlong ago that a tax exemption can be viewed as a form of government520US2 Unit: $U54 [09-10-99 19:36:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN590 CAMPS NEWFOUND/OWATONNA, INC. v. TOWNOF HARRISONOpinion of the CourtIn Walz v. Tax Comm'n of City of New York, 397 U. S. 664(1970), notwithstanding our assumption that a direct subsidyof religious activity would be invalid,23 we held that NewYork's tax exemption for church property did not violate theEstablishment Clause of the First Amendment.24 Thatholding rested, in part, on the premise that there is a constitutionally significant difference between subsidies and taxexemptions.25 We have expressly recognized that this distinction is also applicable to claims that certain state actiondesigned to give residents an advantage in the marketplaceis prohibited by the Commerce Clause.In New Energy Co. of Ind. v. Limbach, 486 U. S. 269 (1988),we found unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause anOhio tax scheme that provided a sales tax credit for ethanolproduced in State, or manufactured in another State to theextent that State gave similar tax advantages to ethanolproduced in Ohio. We recognized that the party challengingthe Ohio scheme was "eligible to receive a cash subsidy"spending. See Regan v. Taxation with Representation of Wash., 461 U. S.540, 544 (1983). The distinction we have drawn for dormant CommerceClause purposes does not turn on this point.23 We noted: "Obviously a direct money subsidy would be a relationshippregnant with involvement and, as with most governmental grant programs, could encompass sustained and detailed administrative relationships for enforcement of statutory or administrative standards, but that isnot this case." Walz, 397 U. S., at 675.24 We reasoned that "New York's statute [cannot be read] as attemptingto establish religion; it . . . simply spar[es] the exercise of religion fromthe burden of property taxation levied on private profit institutions." Id.,at 673.25 "The grant of a tax exemption is not sponsorship since the government does not transfer part of its revenue to churches but simply abstainsfrom demanding that the church support the state. No one has ever suggested that tax exemption has converted libraries, art galleries, or hospitals into arms of the state or put employees `on the public payroll.' " Id.,at 675. As Justice Brennan noted: "Tax exemptions and general subsidies. . . are qualitatively different." Id., at 690 (concurring opinion).520US2 Unit: $U54 [09-10-99 19:36:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN591Cite as: 520 U.

Id., at 278.That was of no importance. We noted: "The CommerceClause does not prohibit all state action designed to give itsresidents an advantage in the marketplace, but only actionof that descriptionin connection with the State's regulationof interstate commerce. Direct subsidization of domesticindustry does not ordinarily run afoul of that prohibition;discriminatory taxation . . . does." Ibid. (emphasis in original). See also West Lynn, 512 U. S., at 210 (Scalia, J., con-curring in judgment) (drawing similar distinction betweenforbidden generally applicable tax with discriminatory "ex-emption" and permissible "subsidy . . . funded from theState's general revenues"). This distinction is supported byscholarly commentary as well as precedent, and we see noreason to depart from it. See Enrich, Saving the Statesfrom Themselves: Commerce Clause Constraints on StateTax Incentives for Business, 110 Harv. L. Rev. 377, 442-443(1996); Hellerstein & Coenen, Commerce Clause Restraintson State Business Development Incentives, 81 Cornell L.Rev. 789, 846-848 (1996).26 The Town's claim that its discriminatory tax scheme should be viewed as a permissiblesubsidy is therefore unpersuasive.2726 The distinction provides a sufficient response to the Town's argumentthat our ruling today would invalidate a State's subsidization of all or partof its residents' tuition at state-owned universities.27 Justice Scalia, post, at 605-606, and n. 4, would distinguish this lineof authority by holding that it should not apply where a State is givingtax relief to charitable enterprises. As explained in Part V, supra, wesee no categorical reason to treat for-profit and nonprofit entities differently under the dormant Commerce Clause. Justice Scalia's heavy reliance upon Board of Ed. of Ky. Annual Conference of Methodist EpiscopalChurch v. Illinois, 203 U. S. 553 (1906), is misplaced. In that case, a bequest to a Kentucky charitable corporation did not qualify for an exemp520US2 Unit: $U54 [09-10-99 19:36:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN592 CAMPS NEWFOUND/OWATONNA, INC. v. TOWNOF HARRISONOpinion of the CourtFinally, the Town argues that its discriminatory tax ex-emption scheme falls within the "market-participant" exception. As we explained in New Energy Co.: "That doctrinedifferentiates between a State's acting in its distinctive governmental capacity, and a State's acting in the more generalcapacity of a market participant; only the former is subjectto the limitations of the negative Commerce Clause." 486U. S., at 277. See White v. Massachusetts Council ofConstr. Employers, Inc., 460 U. S. 204, 208 (1983); Reeves,Inc. v. Stake, 447 U. S., at 436-437; Hughes v. AlexandriaScrap Corp., 426 U. S., at 810.In Alexandria Scrap we concluded that the State of Mary-land had, in effect, entered the market for abandoned automobile hulks as a purchaser because it was using state fundsto provide bounties for their removal from Maryland streetsand junkyards.Id., at 809-810. In Reeves, the State ofSouth Dakota similarly participated in the market for ce-ment as a seller of the output of the cement plant that it hadowned and operated for many years. 447 U. S., at 431-432.And inWhite, the city of Boston had participated in the construction industry by funding certain projects. 460 U. S., at205-206. These three cases stand for the proposition that,for purposes of analysis under the dormant CommerceClause, a State acting in its proprietary capacity as a purtion from the Illinois inheritance tax because the corporate legatee wasnot incorporated in Illinois. In this case, the petitioner is a Maine corporation, and the validity of the portion of the Maine statute that denies theexemption to out-of-state corporations is not at issue. Moreover, unlikethe situation in Board of Ed. of Ky., in which none of the charitable activities of the legatee were performed in Illinois, all of the benefits of attending petitioner's camp in Maine are "bestowed within her borders." Id.,at 563. While the dictum that Justice Scalia quotes, post, at 606, isconsistent with his analysis, it does not purport to address the applicabilityof the dormant Commerce Clause to charities in general, to resident charities, or to nonresident charities that provide benefits for both residentsand nonresidents.520US2 Unit: $U54 [09-10-99 19:36:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN593Cite as: 520 U. S. 564 (1997)Opinion of the Courtchaser or seller may "favor its own citizens over others."Alexandria Scrap, 426 U. S., at 810.Maine's tax exemption statute cannot be characterized asa proprietary activity falling within the market-participantexception. In New Energy Co., Ohio argued similarly thata discriminatory tax credit program fell within the exception. We noted that the tax program had "the purpose andeffect of subsidizing a particular industry, as do many dispositions of the tax laws." 486 U. S., at 277. "That," weexplained, "does not transform it into a form of state participation in the free market." Ibid. "The Ohio action ultimately at issue is neither its purchase nor its sale of ethanol,but its assessment and computation of taxes--a primevalgovernmental activity." Ibid. As we indicated in White:"[I]n this kind of case there is `a single inquiry: whether thechallenged "program constituted direct state participation inthe market." ' " 460 U. S., at 208 (quoting Reeves, 447 U. S.,at 436, n. 7). A tax exemption is not the sort of direct stateinvolvement in the market that falls within the marketparticipation doctrine.Even if we were prepared to expand the exception in themanner suggested by the Town, the Maine tax statute atissue here would be a poor candidate. Like the tax exemption upheld in Walz--which applied to libraries, art galleries,and hospitals as well as churches 28--the exemption that hasbeen denied to petitioner is available to a broad categoryof charitable and benevolent institutions.29 For that reason, nothing short of a dramatic expansion of the "market28 See Walz, 397 U. S., at 666-667, and n. 1.29 See Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 36, $ 652(1)(A) (Supp. 1996) ("For thepurposes of this paragraph, `benevolent and charitable institutions' include, but are not limited to, nonprofit nursing homes and nonprofit boarding homes and boarding care facilities . . . , nonprofit community mentalhealth service facilities . . . [,] and nonprofit child care centers") (emphasis added).520US2 Unit: $U54 [09-10-99 19:36:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN594 CAMPS NEWFOUND/OWATONNA, INC. v. TOWNOF HARRISONOpinion of the Courtparticipant" exception would support its application to thiscase. Alexandria Scrap involved Maryland's entry into themarket for automobile hulks, a discrete activity focused on asingle industry. Similarly, South Dakota's participation inthe market for cement was--in part because of its narrowscope--readily conceived as a proprietary action of the State.In contrast, Maine's tax exemption--which sweeps to coverbroad swathes of the nonprofit sector--must be viewed asaction taken in the State's sovereign capacity rather than aproprietary decision to make an entry into all of the marketsin which the exempted charities function. See White, 460U. S., at 211, n. 7 (noting that "there are some limits ona state or local government's ability to impose restrictions that reach beyond the immediate parties with whichthe government transacts business"). The Town's versionof the "market-participant" exception would swallow therule against discriminatory tax schemes. Contrary to theTown's submission, the notion that whenever a State provides a discriminatory tax abatement it is "purchasing" someservice in its proprietary capacity is not readily confined tothe charitable context. A special tax concession for liquorsindigenous to Hawaii, for example, might be conceived asa "purchase" of the jobs produced by local industry, or aninvestment in the unique local cultural value provided bythese beverages. Cf. Bacchus, 468 U. S., at 270-271. Discriminatory schemes favoring local farmers might be seen asthe "purchase" of agricultural services in order to ensurethat the State's citizens will have a steady local supply of theproduct. Cf. West Lynn, 512 U. S., at 190 (striking downstatute protecting in-state milk producers designed to "preserve . . . local industry," "thereby ensur[ing] a continuousand adequate supply of fresh milk for our market" (internalquotation marks omitted)). Our cases provide no supportfor the Town's radical effort to expand the marketparticipant doctrine.520US2 Unit: $U54 [09-10-99 19:36:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN595Cite as: 520 U.
