This case presents the question whether a court, in determining an award of reasonable attorney's fees under $ 7002(e)of the Solid Waste Disposal Act (SWDA), 90 Stat. 2826, asamended, 42 U. S. C. $ 6972(e), or $ 505(d) of the Federal WaterPollution Control Act (Clean Water Act (CWA)), 86 Stat. 889,as amended, 33 U. S. C. $ 1365(d), may enhance the fee awardabove the "lodestar" amount in order to reflect the fact thatthe party's attorneys were retained on a contingent-fee basisand thus assumed the risk of receiving no payment at all fortheir services. Although different fee-shifting statutes areinvolved, the question is essentially identical to the one weaddressed, but did not resolve, in Pennsylvania v. DelawareValley Citizens' Council for Clean Air, 483 U. S. 711 (1987)(Delaware Valley II).IRespondent Ernest Dague, Sr. (whom we will refer to inplace of all the respondents), owns land in Vermont adjacentto a landfill that was owned and operated by petitioner cityof Burlington. Represented by attorneys retained on acontingent-fee basis, he sued Burlington over its operationof the landfill. The District Court ruled, inter alia, thatBurlington had violated provisions of the SWDA and theCWA, and ordered Burlington to close the landfill by January1, 1990. It also determined that Dague was a "substantiallyprevailing party" entitled to an award of attorney's feesunder the Acts, see 42 U. S. C. $ 6972(e); 33 U. S. C. $ 1365(d).732 F. Supp. 458 (Vt. 1989).In calculating the attorney's fees award, the District Courtfirst found reasonable the figures advanced by Dague for hisattorneys' hourly rates and for the number of hours expended by them, producing a resulting "lodestar" attorney'sfee of $198,027.50. (What our cases have termed the "lodestar" is "the product of reasonable hours times a reasonablerate," Pennsylvania v.

S. 546, 565 (1986) (Delaware Valley I).)Addressing Dague's request for a contingency enhancement,the court looked to Circuit precedent, which provided that" `the rationale that should guide the court's discretion iswhether "[w]ithout the possibility of a fee enhancement . . .competent counsel might refuse to represent [environmental] clients thereby denying them effective access to thecourts." ' " App. to Pet. for Cert. 131-132 (quotingFriendsof the Earth v. Eastman Kodak Co., 834 F. 2d 295, 298 (CA21987), in turn quoting Lewis v. Coughlin, 801 F. 2d 570, 576(CA2 1986)). Following this guidance, the court declaredthat Dague's "risk of not prevailing was substantial" and that"absent an opportunity for enhancement, [Dague] wouldhave faced substantial difficulty in obtaining counsel of rea-sonable skill and competence in this complicated field of law."It concluded that "a 25% enhancement is appropriate, butanything more would be a windfall to the attorneys." Ittherefore enhanced the lodestar amount by 25%--$49,506.87.App. to Pet. for Cert. 133, 134.The Court of Appeals affirmed in all respects. Reviewingthe various opinions in Delaware Valley II, the court concluded that the issue whether and when a contingency en-hancement is warranted remained open, and expressly disagreed with the position taken by some Courts of Appealsthat the concurrence in Delaware Valley II was controlling.The court stated that the District Court had correctly reliedon Circuit precedent, and, holding that the District Court'sfindings were not clearly erroneous, it upheld the 25% contin-gency enhancement. 935 F. 2d 1343, 1359-1360 (CA2 1991).We granted certiorari only with respect to the propriety ofthe contingency enhancement. 502 U. S. 1071 (1992).IIWe first provide some background to the issue before us.Fees for legal services in litigation may be either "certain"or "contingent" (or some hybrid of the two). A fee is certain505us2109K 07-09-96 20:05:24 PAGES OPINPGT561Cite as: 505 U. S. 557 (1992)Opinion of the Courtif it is payable without regard to the outcome of the suit;it is contingent if the obligation to pay depends on a particular result's being obtained. Under the most commoncontingent-fee contract for litigation, the attorney receivesno payment for his services if his client loses. Under thisarrangement, the attorney bears a contingent risk of nonpayment that is the inverse of the case's prospects of success: ifhis client has an 80% chance of winning, the attorney's contingent risk is 20%.InDelaware Valley II, we reversed a judgment that hadaffirmed enhancement of a fee award to reflect the contingent risk of nonpayment. In the process, we addressedwhether the typical federal fee-shifting statute (there,$ 304(d) of the Clean Air Act, 42 U. S. C. $ 7604(d)) permitsan attorney's fees award to be enhanced on account of contingency. In the principal opinion, Justice White, joinedon this point by three other Justices, determined that suchenhancement is not permitted. 483 U. S., at 723-727. Justice O'Connor, in an opinion concurring in part and concur-ring in the judgment, concluded that no enhancement forcontingency is appropriate "unless the applicant can estab-lish that without an adjustment for risk the prevailing partywould have faced substantial difficulties in finding counselin the local or other relevant market,"id., at 733 (internalquotation marks omitted), and that any enhancement "mustbe based on the difference in market treatment of contingentfee casesas a class, rather than on an assessment of the`riskiness' of any particular case," id., at 731 (emphasis inoriginal). Justice Blackmun's dissenting opinion, joinedby three other Justices, concluded that enhancement for contingency is always statutorily required. Id., at 737-742, 754.We turn again to this same issue.IIISection 7002(e) of the SWDA and $ 505(d) of the CWA au-thorize a court to "award costs of litigation (including rea505us2109K 07-09-96 20:05:24 PAGES OPINPGT562 BURLINGTON v. DAGUEOpinion of the Courtsonable attorney . . . fees)" to a "prevailing or substantiallyprevailing party." 42 U. S. C. $ 6972(e) (emphasis added); 33U. S. C. $ 1365(d) (emphasis added). This language is similarto that of many other federal fee-shifting statutes, see,e. g.,42 U. S. C. $$ 1988, 2000e-5(k), 7604(d); our case law construing what is a "reasonable" fee applies uniformly to all ofthem.Flight Attendants v. Zipes, 491 U. S. 754, 758, n. 2(1989).The "lodestar" figure has, as its name suggests, becomethe guiding light of our fee-shifting jurisprudence. We haveestablished a "strong presumption" that the lodestar represents the "reasonable" fee, Delaware Valley I, supra, at 565,and have placed upon the fee applicant who seeks more thanthat the burden of showing that "such an adjustment isnecessary to the determination of a reasonable fee." Blumv. Stenson, 465 U. S. 886, 898 (1984) (emphasis added). TheCourt of Appeals held, and Dague argues here, that a"reasonable" fee for attorneys who have been retained on acontingency-fee basis must go beyond the lodestar, to compensate for risk of loss and of consequent nonpayment. Feeshifting statutes should be construed, he contends, to replicate the economic incentives that operate in the private legalmarket, where attorneys working on a contingency-fee basiscan be expected to charge some premium over their ordinaryhourly rates. Petitioner Burlington argues, by contrast,that the lodestar fee may not be enhanced for contingency.We note at the outset that an enhancement for contingencywould likely duplicate in substantial part factors alreadysubsumed in the lodestar. The risk of loss in a particularcase (and, therefore, the attorney's contingent risk) is theproduct of two factors: (1) the legal and factual merits of theclaim, and (2) the difficulty of establishing those merits.The second factor, however, is ordinarily reflected in thelodestar--either in the higher number of hours expended toovercome the difficulty, or in the higher hourly rate of theattorney skilled and experienced enough to do so. Blum,505us2109K 07-09-96 20:05:24 PAGES OPINPGT563Cite as: 505 U. S. 557 (1992)Opinion of the Courtsupra, at 898-899. Taking account of it again through lode-star enhancement amounts to double counting.DelawareValley II, 483 U. S., at 726-727 (plurality opinion).The first factor (relative merits of the claim) is not reflected in the lodestar, but there are good reasons why itshould play no part in the calculation of the award. It is, ofcourse, a factor thatalways exists (no claim has a 100%chance of success), so that computation of the lodestar wouldnever end the court's inquiry in contingent-fee cases. Seeid., at 740 (Blackmun, J., dissenting). Moreover, the conse-quence of awarding contingency enhancement to take account of this "merits" factor would be to provide attorneyswith the same incentive to bring relatively meritless claimsas relatively meritorious ones. Assume, for example, twoclaims, one with underlying merit of 20%, the other of 80%.Absent any contingency enhancement, a contingent-fee attorney would prefer to take the latter, since he is four timesmore likely to be paid. But with a contingency enhancement, this preference will disappear: the enhancement forthe 20% claim would be a multiplier of 5 (100/20), which isquadruple the 1.25 multiplier (100/80) that would attach tothe 80% claim. Thus, enhancement for the contingency riskposed by each case would encourage meritorious claims tobe brought, but only at the social cost of indiscriminatelyencouraging nonmeritorious claims to be brought as well.We think that an unlikely objective of the "reasonable fees"provisions. "These statutes were not designed as a formof economic relief to improve the financial lot of lawyers."Delaware Valley I, 478 U. S., at 565.Instead of enhancement based upon the contingency riskposed by each case, Dague urges that we adopt the approachset forth in the Delaware Valley II concurrence. We declineto do so, first and foremost because we do not see how it canintelligibly be applied. On the one hand, it would requirethe party seeking contingency enhancement to "establishthat without the adjustment for risk [he] `would have faced505us2109K 07-09-96 20:05:24 PAGES OPINPGT564 BURLINGTON v. DAGUEOpinion of the Courtsubstantial difficulties in finding counsel in the local or otherrelevant market.' " 483 U. S., at 733. On the other hand,it would forbid enhancement based "on an assessment ofthe `riskiness' of any particular case."Id., at 731; see id.,at 734 (no enhancement "based on `legal' risks or risks peculiar to the case"). But since the predominant reason that acontingent-fee claimant has difficulty finding counsel in anylegal market where the winner's attorney's fees will be paidby the loser is that attorneys view his case as too risky(i. e., too unlikely to succeed), these two propositions, as apractical matter, collide. SeeKing v. Palmer, 292 U. S.App. D. C. 362, 371, 950 F. 2d 771, 780 (1991) (en banc), cert.pending sub nom. King v. Ridley, No. 91-1370.A second difficulty with the approach taken by the concurrence in Delaware Valley II is that it would base the contingency enhancement on "the difference in market treatmentof contingent fee cases as a class." 483 U. S., at 731 (emphasis in original). To begin with, for a very large proportionof contingency-fee cases--those seeking not monetary damages but injunctive or other equitable relief--there is no"market treatment." Such cases scarcely exist, except tothe extent Congress has created an artificial "market" forthem by fee shifting--and looking to that "market" for themeaning of fee shifting is obviously circular. Our decreeswould follow the "market," which in turn is based on ourdecrees. See King v. Palmer, 285 U. S. App. D. C. 68, 76,906 F. 2d 762, 770 (1990) (Williams, J., concurring) ("I see thejudicial judgment as defining the market, not vice versa"),vacated, 292 U. S. App. D. C. 362, 950 F. 2d 771 (1991), cert.pending sub nom. King v. Ridley, No. 91-1370. But evenapart from that difficulty, any approach that applies uniformtreatment to the entire class of contingent-fee cases, or toany conceivable subject-matter-based subclass, cannot possibly achieve the supposed goal of mirroring market incentives. As discussed above, the contingent risk of a case (andhence the difficulty of getting contingent-fee lawyers to take505us2109K 07-09-96 20:05:24 PAGES OPINPGT565Cite as: 505 U. S. 557 (1992)Opinion of the Courtit) depends principally upon its particular merits. Contin-gency enhancement calculated on any class-wide basis,therefore, guarantees at best (leaving aside the double-counting problem described earlier) that those cases withinthe class that have the class-average chance of success willbe compensated according to what the "market" requires toproduce the services, and that all cases having above-class-average chance of success will be overcompensated.Looking beyond the Delaware Valley II concurrence's ap-proach, we perceive no other basis, fairly derivable from thefee-shifting statutes, by which contingency enhancement, ifadopted, could be restricted to fewer than all contingent-feecases. And we see a number of reasons for concluding thatno contingency enhancement whatever is compatible withthe fee-shifting statutes at issue. First, just as the statu-tory language limiting fees to prevailing (or substantiallyprevailing) parties bars a prevailing plaintiff from recoveringfees relating to claims on which he lost, Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U. S. 424 (1983), so should it bar a prevailing plain-tiff from recovering for the risk of loss. SeeDelaware Val-ley II, supra, at 719-720, 724-725 (principal opinion). Anattorney operating on a contingency-fee basis pools the riskspresented by his various cases: cases that turn out to besuccessful pay for the time he gambled on those that did not.To award a contingency enhancement under a fee-shiftingstatute would in effect pay for the attorney's time (or antici-pated time) in cases where his client doesnot prevail.Second, both before and since Delaware Valley II, "wehave generally turned away from the contingent-feemodel"--which would make the fee award a percentage ofthe value of the relief awarded in the primary action*--"to*Contrary to Justice Blackmun's understanding, post, at 572, there isno reason in theory why the contingent-fee model could not apply to reliefother than damages; where injunctive relief is obtained, for example, thefee award would simply be a percentage of the value of the injunctiverelief. There would be, to be sure, severe problems of administration in505us2109K 07-09-96 20:05:24 PAGES OPINPGT566 BURLINGTON v. DAGUEOpinion of the Courtthe lodestar model." Venegas v. Mitchell, 495 U. S. 82, 87(1990). We have done so, it must be noted, even though thelodestar model often (perhaps, generally) results in a largerfee award than the contingent-fee model. See, e. g., Reportof the Federal Courts Study Committee 104 (Apr. 2, 1990)(lodestar method may "give lawyers incentives to run uphours unnecessarily, which can lead to overcompensation").For example, in Blanchard v. Bergeron, 489 U. S. 87 (1989),we held that the lodestar governed, even though it produceda fee that substantially exceeded the amount provided in thecontingent-fee agreement between plaintiff and his counsel(which was self-evidently an amount adequate to attract theneeded legal services). Id., at 96. Contingency enhancement is a feature inherent in the contingent-fee model (sinceattorneys factor in the particular risks of a case in negotiating their fee and in deciding whether to accept the case). Toengraft this feature onto the lodestar model would be to concoct a hybrid scheme that resorts to the contingent-fee modelto increase a fee award but not to reduce it. Contingencyenhancement is therefore not consistent with our general rejection of the contingent-fee model for fee awards, nor is itnecessary to the determination of a reasonable fee.And finally, the interest in ready administrability that hasunderlain our adoption of the lodestar approach, see, e. g.,Hensley, 461 U. S., at 433, and the related interest in avoidingburdensome satellite litigation (the fee application "shouldnot result in a second major litigation," id., at 437), counselstrongly against adoption of contingency enhancement. Contingency enhancement would make the setting of fees morecomplex and arbitrary, hence more unpredictable, and hencemore litigable. It is neither necessary nor even possible forapplication of the fee-shifting statutes to mimic the intricadetermining the value of injunctive relief, but such problems simply highlight why we have rejected the contingent-fee model in favor of the lodestar model.505us2109K 07-09-96 20:05:24 PAGES OPINPGT567Cite as: 505 U.
