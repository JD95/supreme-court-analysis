Petitioner Michael Crawford stabbed a man who allegedlytried to rape his wife, Sylvia. At his trial, the State playedfor the jury Sylvia's tape-recorded statement to the policedescribing the stabbing, even though he had no opportunityfor cross-examination. The Washington Supreme Court up-held petitioner's conviction after determining that Sylvia'sstatement was reliable. The question presented is whetherthis procedure complied with the Sixth Amendment's guarantee that, "[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shallenjoy the right . . . to be confronted with the witnessesagainst him." IOn August 5, 1999, Kenneth Lee was stabbed at his apart-ment. Police arrested petitioner later that night. Aftergiving petitioner and his wife Miranda warnings, detectivesinterrogated each of them twice. Petitioner eventually confessed that he and Sylvia had gone in search of Lee becausehe was upset over an earlier incident in which Lee had triedto rape her. The two had found Lee at his apartment, anda fight ensued in which Lee was stabbed in the torso andpetitioner's hand was cut.Petitioner gave the following account of the fight:"Q. Okay. Did you ever see anything in [Lee's] hands?"A. I think so, but I'm not positive."Q. Okay, when you think so, what do you mean by that?"A.

Id., at 137 (punctuationadded).The State charged petitioner with assault and attemptedmurder. At trial, he claimed self-defense. Sylvia did nottestify because of the state marital privilege, which gener-ally bars a spouse from testifying without the other spouse'sconsent. See Wash. Rev. Code $ 5.60.060(1) (1994). InWashington, this privilege does not extend to a spouse's outof-court statements admissible under a hearsay exception,see State v. Burden, 120 Wash. 2d 371, 377, 841 P. 2d 758,761 (1992), so the State sought to introduce Sylvia's tape-recorded statements to the police as evidence that the stabbing was not in self-defense. Noting that Sylvia had ad-mitted she led petitioner to Lee's apartment and thus hadfacilitated the assault, the State invoked the hearsay excep-tion for statements against penal interest, Wash. Rule Evid.804(b)(3) (2003).Petitioner countered that, state law notwithstanding, admitting the evidence would violate his federal constitutionalright to be "confronted with the witnesses against him."Amdt. 6. According to our description of that right in Ohiov.Roberts, 448 U. S. 56 (1980), it does not bar admission ofan unavailable witness's statement against a criminal defendant if the statement bears "adequate `indicia of reliability.' "Id., at 66. To meet that test, evidence must either fallwithin a "firmly rooted hearsay exception" or bear "particularized guarantees of trustworthiness." Ibid. The trialcourt here admitted the statement on the latter ground, offering several reasons why it was trustworthy: Sylvia wasnot shifting blame but rather corroborating her husband'sstory that he acted in self-defense or "justified reprisal"; shehad direct knowledge as an eyewitness; she was describingrecent events; and she was being questioned by a "neutral"law enforcement officer. App. 76-77. The prosecutionplayed the tape for the jury and relied on it in closing, ar-guing that it was "damning evidence" that "completely541US1 Unit: $U29 [05-20-06 18:16:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN41Cite as: 541 U. S. 36 (2004)Opinion of the Courtrefutes [petitioner's] claim of self-defense." Tr. 468 (Oct. 21,1999). The jury convicted petitioner of assault.The Washington Court of Appeals reversed. It applieda nine-factor test to determine whether Sylvia's statementbore particularized guarantees of trustworthiness, and notedseveral reasons why it did not: The statement contradictedone she had previously given; it was made in response tospecific questions; and at one point she admitted she had shuther eyes during the stabbing. The court considered and re-jected the State's argument that Sylvia's statement was reliable because it coincided with petitioner's to such a degreethat the two "interlocked." The court determined that,although the two statements agreed about the events leadingup to the stabbing, they differed on the issue crucial to petitioner's self-defense claim: "[Petitioner's] version assertsthat Lee may have had something in his hand when hestabbed him; but Sylvia's version has Lee grabbing for some-thing only after he has been stabbed." App. 32.The Washington Supreme Court reinstated the conviction,unanimously concluding that, although Sylvia's statement didnot fall under a firmly rooted hearsay exception, it bore guar-antees of trustworthiness: " `[W]hen a codefendant's confession is virtually identical [to, i. e., interlocks with,] that of adefendant, it may be deemed reliable.' " 147 Wash. 2d 424,437, 54 P. 3d 656, 663 (2002) (quoting State v. Rice, 120 Wash.2d 549, 570, 844 P. 2d 416, 427 (1993)). The court explained:"Although the Court of Appeals concluded that thestatements were contradictory, upon closer inspectionthey appear to overlap. . . ."[B]oth of the Crawfords' statements indicate that Leewas possibly grabbing for a weapon, but they areequally unsure when this event may have taken place.They are also equally unsure how Michael received thecut on his hand, leading the court to question when,if ever, Lee possessed a weapon. In this respect theyoverlap. . . .541US1 Unit: $U29 [05-20-06 18:16:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN42 CRAWFORD v. WASHINGTONOpinion of the Court"[N]either Michael nor Sylvia clearly stated that Leehad a weapon in hand from which Michael was simplydefending himself. And it is this omission by both thatinterlocks the statements and makes Sylvia's statementreliable." 147 Wash. 2d, at 438-439, 54 P. 3d, at 664(internal quotation marks omitted).1We granted certiorari to determine whether the State'suse of Sylvia's statement violated the Confrontation Clause.539 U. S. 914 (2003). IIThe Sixth Amendment's Confrontation Clause providesthat, "[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoythe right . . . to be confronted with the witnesses againsthim." We have held that this bedrock procedural guaranteeapplies to both federal and state prosecutions. Pointer v.Texas, 380 U. S. 400, 406 (1965). As noted above, Robertssays that an unavailable witness's out-of-court statementmay be admitted so long as it has adequate indicia of reliability--i. e., falls within a "firmly rooted hearsay exception" orbears "particularized guarantees of trustworthiness." 448U. S., at 66. Petitioner argues that this test strays from theoriginal meaning of the Confrontation Clause and urges usto reconsider it. AThe Constitution's text does not alone resolve this case.One could plausibly read "witnesses against" a defendant to1 The court rejected the State's argument that guarantees of trustworthiness were unnecessary since petitioner waived his confrontation rightsby invoking the marital privilege. It reasoned that "forcing the defendant to choose between the marital privilege and confronting his spousepresents an untenable Hobson's choice." 147 Wash. 2d, at 432, 54 P. 3d,at 660. The State has not challenged this holding here. The State alsohas not challenged the Court of Appeals' conclusion (not reached by theState Supreme Court) that the confrontation violation, if it occurred, wasnot harmless. We express no opinion on these matters.541US1 Unit: $U29 [05-20-06 18:16:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN43Cite as: 541 U. S. 36 (2004)Opinion of the Courtmean those who actually testify at trial, cf. Woodsidesv.State, 3 Miss. 655, 664-665 (1837), those whose statements are offered at trial, see 3 J. Wigmore, Evidence $ 1397,p. 104 (2d ed. 1923) (hereinafter Wigmore), or something inbetween, see infra, at 52-53. We must therefore turn tothe historical background of the Clause to understand itsmeaning.The right to confront one's accusers is a concept that datesback to Roman times. SeeCoy v. Iowa, 487 U. S. 1012, 1015(1988); Herrmann & Speer, Facing the Accuser: Ancient andMedieval Precursors of the Confrontation Clause, 34 Va. J.Int'l L. 481 (1994). The founding generation's immediatesource of the concept, however, was the common law. English common law has long differed from continental civil lawin regard to the manner in which witnesses give testimonyin criminal trials. The common-law tradition is one of livetestimony in court subject to adversarial testing, while thecivil law condones examination in private by judicial officers.See 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England373-374 (1768).Nonetheless, England at times adopted elements of thecivil-law practice. Justices of the peace or other officials examined suspects and witnesses before trial. These examinations were sometimes read in court in lieu of live testimony, a practice that "occasioned frequent demands by theprisoner to have his `accusers,' i. e. the witnesses againsthim, brought before him face to face." 1 J. Stephen, Historyof the Criminal Law of England 326 (1883). In some cases,these demands were refused. See 9 W. Holdsworth, Historyof English Law 216-217, 228 (3d ed. 1944); e. g., Raleigh'sCase, 2 How. St. Tr. 1, 15-16, 24 (1603); Throckmorton's Case,1 How. St. Tr. 869, 875-876 (1554); cf. Lilburn's Case, 3 How.St. Tr. 1315, 1318-1322, 1329 (Star Chamber 1637).Pretrial examinations became routine under two statutespassed during the reign of Queen Mary in the 16th century,1 & 2 Phil. & M., c. 13 (1554), and 2 & 3 id., c. 10 (1555).541US1 Unit: $U29 [05-20-06 18:16:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN44 CRAWFORD v. WASHINGTONOpinion of the CourtThese Marian bail and committal statutes required justicesof the peace to examine suspects and witnesses in felonycases and to certify the results to the court. It is doubtfulthat the original purpose of the examinations was to produceevidence admissible at trial. See J. Langbein, ProsecutingCrime in the Renaissance 21-34 (1974). Whatever the original purpose, however, they came to be used as evidence insome cases, see 2 M. Hale, Pleas of the Crown 284 (1736),resulting in an adoption of continental procedure. See 4Holdsworth, supra, at 528-530.The most notorious instances of civil-law examination occurred in the great political trials of the 16th and 17th centuries. One such was the 1603 trial of Sir Walter Raleigh fortreason. Lord Cobham, Raleigh's alleged accomplice, hadimplicated him in an examination before the Privy Counciland in a letter. At Raleigh's trial, these were read to thejury. Raleigh argued that Cobham had lied to save himself:"Cobham is absolutely in the King's mercy; to excuse mecannot avail him; by accusing me he may hope for favour."1 D. Jardine, Criminal Trials 435 (1832). Suspecting thatCobham would recant, Raleigh demanded that the judgescall him to appear, arguing that "[t]he Proof of the CommonLaw is by witness and jury: let Cobham be here, let himspeak it. Call my accuser before my face . . . ." 2 How.St. Tr., at 15-16. The judges refused, id., at 24, and, despiteRaleigh's protestations that he was being tried "by the Spanish Inquisition," id., at 15, the jury convicted, and Raleighwas sentenced to death.One of Raleigh's trial judges later lamented that " `the justice of England has never been so degraded and injured asby the condemnation of Sir Walter Raleigh.' " 1 Jardine,supra, at 520. Through a series of statutory and judicialreforms, English law developed a right of confrontation thatlimited these abuses. For example, treason statutes required witnesses to confront the accused "face to face" at hisarraignment. E. g., 13 Car. 2, c. 1, $ 5 (1661); see 1 Hale,541US1 Unit: $U29 [05-20-06 18:16:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN45Cite as: 541 U. S. 36 (2004)Opinion of the Courtsupra, at 306. Courts, meanwhile, developed relativelystrict rules of unavailability, admitting examinations only ifthe witness was demonstrably unable to testify in person.SeeLord Morley's Case, 6 How. St. Tr. 769, 770-771 (H. L.1666); 2 Hale, supra, at 284; 1 Stephen, supra, at 358. Sev-eral authorities also stated that a suspect's confession couldbe admitted only against himself, and not against others heimplicated. See 2 W. Hawkins, Pleas of the Crown, ch. 46,$ 3, pp. 603-604 (T. Leach 6th ed. 1787); 1 Hale,supra, at 585,n. (k); 1 G. Gilbert, Evidence 216 (C. Lofft ed. 1791);cf.Tong's Case, Kel. J. 17, 18, 84 Eng. Rep. 1061, 1062 (1662)(treason). But see King v. Westbeer, 1 Leach 12, 168 Eng.Rep. 108, 109 (1739).One recurring question was whether the admissibility ofan unavailable witness's pretrial examination depended onwhether the defendant had had an opportunity to crossexamine him. In 1696, the Court of King's Bench answeredthis question in the affirmative, in the widely reported misdemeanor libel case of King v. Paine, 5 Mod. 163, 87 Eng.Rep. 584. The court ruled that, even though a witness wasdead, his examination was not admissible where "the defendant not being present when [it was] taken before the mayor. . . had lost the benefit of a cross-examination." Id., at 165,87 Eng. Rep., at 585. The question was also debated atlength during the infamous proceedings against Sir JohnFenwick on a bill of attainder. Fenwick's counsel objectedto admitting the examination of a witness who had been spirited away, on the ground that Fenwick had had no opportunity to cross-examine. See Fenwick's Case, 13 How. St. Tr.537, 591-592 (H. C. 1696) (Powys) ("[T]hat which they wouldoffer is something that Mr. Goodman hath sworn when hewas examined . . . ; sir J. F. not being present or privy, andno opportunity given to cross-examine the person; and I conceive that cannot be offered as evidence . . ."); id., at 592(Shower) ("[N]o deposition of a person can be read, thoughbeyond sea, unless in cases where the party it is to be read541US1 Unit: $U29 [05-20-06 18:16:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN46 CRAWFORD v. WASHINGTONOpinion of the Courtagainst was privy to the examination, and might have cross-examined him . . . . [O]ur constitution is, that the personshall see his accuser"). The examination was nonethelessadmitted on a closely divided vote after several of thosepresent opined that the common-law rules of procedure didnot apply to parliamentary attainder proceedings--onespeaker even admitting that the evidence would normally beinadmissible. See id., at 603-604 (Williamson); id., at 604-605 (Chancellor of the Exchequer);id., at 607; 3 Wigmore$ 1364, at 22-23, n. 54. Fenwick was condemned, but theproceedings "must have burned into the general consciousness the vital importance of the rule securing the right ofcross-examination." Id., $ 1364, at 22; cf. Carmell v. Texas,529 U. S. 513, 526-530 (2000).Paine had settled the rule requiring a prior opportunityfor cross-examination as a matter of common law, but somedoubts remained over whether the Marian statutes prescribed an exception to it in felony cases. The statutes didnot identify the circumstances under which examinationswere admissible, see 1 & 2 Phil. & M., c. 13 (1554); 2 & 3 id.,c. 10 (1555), and some inferred that no prior opportunity forcross-examination was required. See Westbeer, supra, at 12,168 Eng. Rep., at 109; compare Fenwick's Case, 13 How.St. Tr., at 596 (Sloane), with id., at 602 (Musgrave). Manywho expressed this view acknowledged that it meant thestatutes were in derogation of the common law. See Kingv. Eriswell, 3 T. R. 707, 710, 100 Eng. Rep. 815, 817 (K. B.1790) (Grose, J.) (dicta); id., at 722-723, 100 Eng. Rep.,at 823-824 (Kenyon, C. J.) (same); compare 1 Gilbert, Evidence, at 215 (admissible only "by Force `of the Statute' "),with id., at 65. Nevertheless, by 1791 (the year the SixthAmendment was ratified), courts were applying the crossexamination rule even to examinations by justices of thepeace in felony cases. See King v. Dingler, 2 Leach 561,562-563, 168 Eng. Rep. 383, 383-384 (1791); King v. Woodcock, 1 Leach 500, 502-504, 168 Eng.

Rep.330, 331-332 (1787); 3 Wigmore $ 1364, at 23. Early 19thcentury treatises confirm that requirement. See 1 T.Starkie, Evidence 95 (1826); 2 id., at 484-492; T. Peake, Evidence 63-64 (3d ed. 1808). When Parliament amended thestatutes in 1848 to make the requirement explicit, see 11 &12 Vict., c. 42, $ 17, the change merely "introduced in terms"what was already afforded the defendant "by the equitableconstruction of the law." Queen v. Beeston, 29 Eng. L. &Eq. R. 527, 529 (Ct. Crim. App. 1854) (Jervis, C. J.).2BControversial examination practices were also used in theColonies. Early in the 18th century, for example, the Virginia Council protested against the Governor for having"privately issued several commissions to examine witnessesagainst particular men ex parte," complaining that "the per-son accused is not admitted to be confronted with, or defendhimself against his defamers." A Memorial Concerning theMaladministrations of His Excellency Francis Nicholson,reprinted in 9 English Historical Documents 253, 257 (D.Douglas ed. 1955). A decade before the Revolution, England gave jurisdiction over Stamp Act offenses to the admi-ralty courts, which followed civil-law rather than common2 There is some question whether the requirement of a prior opportunityfor cross-examination applied as well to statements taken by a coroner,which were also authorized by the Marian statutes. See 3 Wigmore$ 1364, at 23 (requirement "never came to be conceded at all in England");T. Peake, Evidence 64, n. (m) (3d ed. 1808) (not finding the point "expresslydecided in any reported case"); State v. Houser, 26 Mo. 431, 436 (1858)("there may be a few cases . . . but the authority of such cases is questioned, even in [England], by their ablest writers on common law"); Statev. Campbell, 30 S. C. L. 124, 130 (App. L. 1844) (point "has not . . . beenplainly adjudged, even in the English cases"). Whatever the English rule,several early American authorities flatly rejected any special status forcoroner statements. See Houser, supra, at 436; Campbell, supra, at 130;T.

See Virginia Declaration of Rights $ 8 (1776); Pennsylvania Declaration of Rights $ IX (1776); Delaware Declaration of Rights$ 14 (1776); Maryland Declaration of Rights $ XIX (1776);North Carolina Declaration of Rights $ VII (1776); VermontDeclaration of Rights Ch.

At the Massachusetts ratifying convention,Abraham Holmes objected to this omission precisely on theground that it would lead to civil-law practices: "The modeof trial is altogether indetermined; . . . whether [the defendant] is to be allowed to confront the witnesses, and have theadvantage of cross-examination, we are not yet told. . . . [W]eshall find Congress possessed of powers enabling them toinstitute judicatories little less inauspicious than a certain541US1 Unit: $U29 [05-20-06 18:16:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN49Cite as: 541 U.

Similarly, a prominent Antifederalist writing under the pseud-onym Federal Farmer criticized the use of "written evidence" while objecting to the omission of a vicinage right:"Nothing can be more essential than the cross examining [of]witnesses, and generally before the triers of the facts inquestion. . . . [W]ritten evidence . . . [is] almost useless; itmust be frequently taken ex parte, and but very seldomleads to the proper discovery of truth." R. Lee, Letter IVby the Federal Farmer (Oct. 15, 1787), reprinted in 1Schwartz, supra, at 469, 473. The First Congress respondedby including the Confrontation Clause in the proposal thatbecame the Sixth Amendment.Early state decisions shed light upon the original understanding of the common-law right. State v. Webb, 2 N. C.103 (Super. L. & Eq. 1794) (per curiam), decided a merethree years after the adoption of the Sixth Amendment, heldthat depositions could be read against an accused only if theywere taken in his presence. Rejecting a broader reading ofthe English authorities, the court held: "[I]t is a rule of thecommon law, founded on natural justice, that no man shall beprejudiced by evidence which he had not the liberty to crossexamine." Id., at 104.Similarly, in State v. Campbell, 30 S. C. L. 124 (App. L.1844), South Carolina's highest law court excluded a deposition taken by a coroner in the absence of the accused. Itheld: "[I]f we are to decide the question by the establishedrules of the common law, there could not be a dissentingvoice. For, notwithstanding the death of the witness, andwhatever the respectability of the court taking the depositions, the solemnity of the occasion and the weight of thetestimony, such depositions are ex parte, and, therefore,utterly incompetent." Id., at 125. The court said that oneof the "indispensable conditions" implicitly guaranteed bythe State Constitution was that "prosecutions be carried on541US1 Unit: $U29 [05-20-06 18:16:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN50 CRAWFORD v. WASHINGTONOpinion of the Courtto the conviction of the accused, by witnesses confronted byhim, and subjected to his personal examination." Ibid.Many other decisions are to the same effect. Some earlycases went so far as to hold that prior testimony was inadmissible in criminal cases even if the accused had a previousopportunity to cross-examine. See Finn v. Commonwealth,26 Va. 701, 708 (1827); State v. Atkins, 1 Tenn. 229 (Super.L. & Eq. 1807)(per curiam). Most courts rejected thatview, but only after reaffirming that admissibility dependedon a prior opportunity for cross-examination. See UnitedStates v. Macomb, 26 F. Cas. 1132, 1133 (No. 15,702) (CC Ill.1851); State v. Houser, 26 Mo. 431, 435-436 (1858); Kendrickv. State, 29 Tenn. 479, 485-488 (1850); Bostick v. State, 22Tenn. 344, 345-346 (1842); Commonwealth v.

Bishop, Criminal Procedure $ 1093, p. 689 (2d ed. 1872);T. Cooley, Constitutional Limitations *318.IIIThis history supports two inferences about the meaning ofthe Sixth Amendment.AFirst, the principal evil at which the Confrontation Clausewas directed was the civil-law mode of criminal procedure,and particularly its use of ex parte examinations as evidenceagainst the accused. It was these practices that the Crowndeployed in notorious treason cases like Raleigh's; that theMarian statutes invited; that English law's assertion of aright to confrontation was meant to prohibit; and that thefounding-era rhetoric decried. The Sixth Amendment mustbe interpreted with this focus in mind.Accordingly, we once again reject the view that the Confrontation Clause applies of its own force only to in-courttestimony, and that its application to out-of-court statements541US1 Unit: $U29 [05-20-06 18:16:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN51Cite as: 541 U. S. 36 (2004)Opinion of the Courtintroduced at trial depends upon "the law of Evidence forthe time being." 3 Wigmore $ 1397, at 101; accord,Duttonv. Evans, 400 U. S. 74, 94 (1970) (Harlan, J., concurring inresult). Leaving the regulation of out-of-court statementsto the law of evidence would render the ConfrontationClause powerless to prevent even the most flagrant inquisitorial practices. Raleigh was, after all, perfectly free to confront those who read Cobham's confession in court.This focus also suggests that not all hearsay implicates theSixth Amendment's core concerns. An off-hand, overheardremark might be unreliable evidence and thus a good candidate for exclusion under hearsay rules, but it bears little resemblance to the civil-law abuses the Confrontation Clausetargeted. On the other hand, ex parte examinations mightsometimes be admissible under modern hearsay rules, butthe Framers certainly would not have condoned them.The text of the Confrontation Clause reflects this focus.It applies to "witnesses" against the accused--in otherwords, those who "bear testimony." 2 N. Webster, AnAmerican Dicti onary of the English Language (1828)."Testimony," in turn, is typically "[a] solemn declarationor affirmation made for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact." Ibid. An accuser who makes a formalstatement to government officers bears testimony in a sensethat a person who makes a casual remark to an acquaintancedoes not. The constitutional text, like the history underlying the common-law right of confrontation, thus reflects anespecially acute concern with a specific type of out-of-courtstatement.Various formulations of this core class of "testimonial"statements exist: "ex parte in-court testimony or its functional equivalent--that is, material such as affidavits, custodial examinations, prior testimony that the defendant wasunable to cross-examine, or similar pretrial statements thatdeclarants would reasonably expect to be used prosecutorially," Brief for Petitioner 23; "extrajudicial statements . . .541US1 Unit: $U29 [05-20-06 18:16:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN52 CRAWFORD v. WASHINGTONOpinion of the Courtcontained in formalized testimonial materials, such as affi-davits, depositions, prior testimony, or confessions," Whitev. Illinois, 502 U. S. 346, 365 (1992) (Thomas, J., joined byScalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment);"statements that were made under circumstances whichwould lead an objective witness reasonably to believe thatthe statement would be available for use at a later trial,"Brief for National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyerset al. as Amici Curiae 3. These formulations all share acommon nucleus and then define the Clause's coverage atvarious levels of abstraction around it. Regardless of theprecise articulation, some statements qualify under anydefinition--for example, ex parte testimony at a preliminary hearing.Statements taken by police officers in the course of interrogations are also testimonial under even a narrow standard.Police interrogations bear a striking resemblance to examinations by justices of the peace in England. The statementsare notsworn testimony, but the absence of oath was notdispositive. Cobham's examination was unsworn, see 1Jardine, Criminal Trials, at 430, yet Raleigh's trial has longbeen thought a paradigmatic confrontation violation, see,e. g., Campbell, 30 S. C. L., at 130. Under the Marian stat-utes, witnesses were typically put on oath, but suspects werenot. See 2 Hale, Pleas of the Crown, at 52. Yet Hawkinsand others went out of their way to caution that such unsworn confessions were not admissible against anyone butthe confessor. See supra, at 45.33 These sources--especially Raleigh's trial--refute The Chief Justice's assertion, post, at 71 (opinion concurring in judgment), that theright of confrontation was not particularly concerned with unsworn testimonial statements. But even if, as he claims, a general bar on unswornhearsay made application of the Confrontation Clause to unsworn testimonial statements a moot point, that would merely change our focus fromdirect evidence of original meaning of the Sixth Amendment to reasonableinference. We find it implausible that a provision which concededly condemned trial by sworn ex parte affidavit thought trial by unsworn ex541US1 Unit: $U29 [05-20-06 18:16:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN53Cite as: 541 U. S. 36 (2004)Opinion of the CourtThat interrogators are police officers rather than magis-trates does not change the picture either. Justices of thepeace conducting examinations under the Marian statuteswere not magistrates as we understand that office today, buthad an essentially investigative and prosecutorial function.See 1 Stephen, Criminal Law of England, at 221; Langbein,Prosecuting Crime in the Renaissance, at 34-45. Englanddid not have a professional police force until the 19th century,see 1 Stephen, supra, at 194-200, so it is not surprising thatother government officers performed the investigative functions now associated primarily with the police. The involve-ment of government officers in the production of testimonialevidence presents the same risk, whether the officers arepolice or justices of the peace.In sum, even if the Sixth Amendment is not solely con-cerned with testimonial hearsay, that is its primary object,and interrogations by law enforcement officers fall squarelywithin that class.4BThe historical record also supports a second proposition:that the Framers would not have allowed admission of testiparte affidavit perfectly OK. (The claim that unsworn testimony wasself-regulating because jurors would disbelieve it, cf. post, at 69-70, n. 1,is belied by the very existence of a general bar on unsworn testimony.)Any attempt to determine the application of a constitutional provision toa phenomenon that did not exist at the time of its adoption (here, allegedly,admissible unsworn testimony) involves some degree of estimation--whatThe Chief Justice calls use of a "proxy," post, at 71--but that is hardlya reason not to make the estimation as accurate as possible. Even if, asThe Chief Justice mistakenly asserts, there were no direct evidence ofhow the Sixth Amendment originally applied to unsworn testimony, thereis no doubt what its application would have been.4 We use the term "interrogation" in its colloquial, rather than any technical legal, sense. Cf. Rhode Island v. Innis, 446 U. S. 291, 300-301 (1980).Just as various definitions of "testimonial" exist, one can imagine variousdefinitions of "interrogation," and we need not select among them in thiscase. Sylvia's recorded statement, knowingly given in response to structured police questioning, qualifies under any conceivable definition.541US1 Unit: $U29 [05-20-06 18:16:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN54 CRAWFORD v. WASHINGTONOpinion of the Courtmonial statements of a witness who did not appear at trialunless he was unavailable to testify, and the defendant hadhad a prior opportunity for cross-examination. The text ofthe Sixth Amendment does not suggest any open-ended exceptions from the confrontation requirement to be developedby the courts. Rather, the "right . . . to be confronted withthe witnesses against him," Amdt. 6, is most naturally readas a reference to the right of confrontation at common law,admitting only those exceptions established at the time ofthe founding. SeeMattox v. United States, 156 U. S. 237,243 (1895); cf. Houser, 26 Mo., at 433-435. As the Englishauthorities above reveal, the common law in 1791 conditionedadmissibility of an absent witness's examination on unavailability and a prior opportunity to cross-examine. The SixthAmendment therefore incorporates those limitations. Thenumerous early state decisions applying the same test con-firm that these principles were received as part of the common law in this country.55 The Chief Justice claims that English law's treatment of testimonialstatements was inconsistent at the time of the framing, post, at 72-73, butthe examples he cites relate to examinations under the Marian statutes.As we have explained, to the extent Marian examinations were admissible,it was only because the statutes derogated from the common law. Seesupra, at 46-47. Moreover, by 1791 even the statutory-derogation viewhad been rejected with respect to justice-of-the-peace examinations--explicitly in King v. Woodcock, 1 Leach 500, 502-504, 168 Eng. Rep. 352, 353(1789), and King v. Dingler, 2 Leach 561, 562-563, 168 Eng. Rep. 383,383-384 (1791), and by implication in King v. Radbourne, 1 Leach 457,459-461, 168 Eng. Rep. 330, 331-332 (1787).None of The Chief Justice's citations proves otherwise. King v.Westbeer, 1 Leach 12, 168 Eng. Rep. 108 (1739), was decided a half centuryearlier and cannot be taken as an accurate statement of the law in 1791given the directly contrary holdings of Woodcock and Dingler. Hale'streatise is older still, and far more ambiguous on this point, see 1 M. Hale,Pleas of the Crown 585-586 (1736); some who espoused the requirementof a prior opportunity for cross-examination thought it entirely consistentwith Hale's views. See Fenwick's Case, 13 How. St. Tr. 537, 602 (H. C.1696) (Musgrave). The only timely authority The Chief Justice cites isKing v. Eriswell, 3 T. R. 707, 100 Eng. Rep. 815 (K. B. 1790), but even thatdecision provides no substantial support. Eriswell was not a criminal541US1 Unit: $U29 [05-20-06 18:16:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN55Cite as: 541 U. S. 36 (2004)Opinion of the CourtWe do not read the historical sources to say that a prioropportunity to cross-examine was merely a sufficient, ratherthan a necessary, condition for admissibility of testimonialstatements. They suggest that this requirement was discase at all, but a Crown suit against the inhabitants of a town to chargethem with care of an insane pauper. Id., at 707-708, 100 Eng. Rep., at815-816. It is relevant only because the judges discuss the Marian statutes in dicta. One of them, Buller, J., defended admission of the pauper'sstatement of residence on the basis of authorities that purportedly held exparte Marian examinations admissible. Id., at 713-714, 100 Eng. Rep., at819. As evidence writers were quick to point out, however, his authorities said no such thing. See Peake, Evidence, at 64, n. (m) ("Mr. J. Bulleris reported to have said that it was so settled in 1 Lev. 180, and Kel. 55;certainly nothing of the kind appears in those books"); 2 T. Starkie, Evidence 487-488, n. (c) (1826) ("Buller, J. . . . refers to Radbourne's case . . . ;but in that case the deposition was taken in the hearing of the prisoner,and of course the question did not arise" (citation omitted)). Two otherjudges, Grose, J., and Kenyon, C. J., responded to Buller's argument bydistinguishing Marian examinations as a statutory exception to thecommon-law rule, but the context and tenor of their remarks suggest theymerely assumed the accuracy of Buller's premise without independentconsideration, at least with respect to examinations by justices of thepeace. See 3 T. R., at 710, 100 Eng. Rep., at 817 (Grose, J.); id., at 722-723,100 Eng. Rep., at 823-824 (Kenyon, C. J.). In fact, the case reporter specifically notes in a footnote that their assumption was erroneous. See id.,at 710, n. (c), 100 Eng. Rep., at 817, n. (c). Notably, Buller's position onpauper examinations was resoundingly rejected only a decade later inKing v. Ferry Frystone, 2 East 54, 55, 102 Eng. Rep. 289 (K. B. 1801)("The point . . . has been since considered to be so clear against the admissibility of the evidence . . . that it was abandoned by the counsel . . .without argument"), further suggesting that his views on evidence werenot mainstream at the time of the framing.In short, none of The Chief Justice's sources shows that the law in1791 was unsettled even as to examinations by justices of the peace underthe Marian statutes. More importantly, however, even if the statutoryrule in 1791 were in doubt, the numerous early state-court decisions makeabundantly clear that the Sixth Amendment incorporated the commonlaw right of confrontation and not any exceptions the Marian statutessupposedly carved out from it. See supra, at 49-50; see also supra, at 47,n. 2 (coroner statements). The common-law rule had been settled sincePaine in 1696. See King v. Paine, 5 Mod. 163, 165, 87 Eng. Rep. 584, 585(K. B.).541US1 Unit: $U29 [05-20-06 18:16:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN56 CRAWFORD v. WASHINGTONOpinion of the Courtpositive, and not merely one of several ways to establish re-liability. This is not to deny, asThe Chief Justice notes,that "[t]here were always exceptions to the general rule ofexclusion" of hearsay evidence. Post, at 73. Several hadbecome well established by 1791. See 3 Wigmore $ 1397, at101; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 13, n. 5. Butthere is scant evidence that exceptions were invoked toadmit testimonial statements against the accused in a crimi-nal case.6 Most of the hearsay exceptions covered statements that by their nature were not testimonial--for exam-ple, business records or statements in furtherance of aconspiracy. We do not infer from these that the Framersthought exceptions would apply even to prior testimony.Cf. Lilly v. Virginia, 527 U. S. 116, 134 (1999) (plurality opin-ion) ("[A]ccomplices' confessions that inculpate a criminaldefendant are not within a firmly rooted exception to thehearsay rule").76 The one deviation we have found involves dying declarations. Theexistence of that exception as a general rule of criminal hearsay law cannot be disputed. See, e. g., Mattox v. United States, 156 U. S. 237, 243-244(1895); King v. Reason, 16 How. St. Tr. 1, 24-38 (K. B. 1722); 1 D. Jardine,Criminal Trials 435 (1832); Cooley, Constitutional Limitations, at *318; 1G. Gilbert, Evidence 211 (C. Lofft ed. 1791); see also F. Heller, The SixthAmendment 105 (1951) (asserting that this was the only recognized criminal hearsay exception at common law). Although many dying declarations may not be testimonial, there is authority for admitting even thosethat clearly are. See Woodcock, supra, at 501-504, 168 Eng. Rep., at 353-354; Reason, supra, at 24-38; Peake, supra, at 64; cf. Radbourne, supra,at 460-462, 168 Eng. Rep., at 332-333. We need not decide in this casewhether the Sixth Amendment incorporates an exception for testimonial dying declarations. If this exception must be accepted on historicalgrounds, it is sui generis.7 We cannot agree with The Chief Justice that the fact "[t]hat a statement might be testimonial does nothing to undermine the wisdom of oneof these [hearsay] exceptions." Post, at 74. Involvement of governmentofficers in the production of testimony with an eye toward trial presentsunique potential for prosecutorial abuse--a fact borne out time and againthroughout a history with which the Framers were keenly familiar. Thisconsideration does not evaporate when testimony happens to fall within541US1 Unit: $U29 [05-20-06 18:16:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN57Cite as: 541 U. S. 36 (2004)Opinion of the CourtIVOur case law has been largely consistent with these twoprinciples. Our leading early decision, for example, involveda deceased witness's pri or trial testimony. Ma tt ox v.United States, 156 U. S. 237 (1895). In allowing the state-ment to be admitted, we relied on the fact that the defendanthad had, at the first trial, an adequate opportunity to con-front the witness: "The substance of the constitutional protection is preserved to the prisoner in the advantage he hasonce had of seeing the witness face to face, and of subjectinghim to the ordeal of a cross-examination. This, the law says,he shall under no circumstances be deprived of . . . ."Id.,at 244.Our later cases conform to Mattox's holding that prior trialor preliminary hearing testimony is admissible only if thedefendant had an adequate opportunity to cross-examine.See Mancusi v. Stubbs, 408 U. S. 204, 213-216 (1972); California v. Green, 399 U. S. 149, 165-168 (1970); Pointer v.Texas, 380 U. S., at 406-408; cf. Kirby v. United States, 174U. S. 47, 55-61 (1899). Even where the defendant had suchan opportunity, we excluded the testimony where the government had not established unavailability of the witness.See Barber v. Page, 390 U. S. 719, 722-725 (1968); cf. Motesv. United States, 178 U. S. 458, 470-471 (1900). We similarlyexcluded accomplice confessions where the defendant had noopportunity to cross-examine. SeeRoberts v. Russell, 392U. S. 293, 294-295 (1968) (per curiam); Bruton v. UnitedStates, 391 U. S. 123, 126-128 (1968); Douglas v. Alabama,380 U. S. 415, 418-420 (1965). In contrast, we consideredreliability factors beyond prior opportunity for crossexamination when the hearsay statement at issue was nottestimonial. SeeDutton v. Evans, 400 U. S., at 87-89 (plurality opinion).some broad, modern hearsay exception, even if that exception might bejustifiable in other circumstances.541US1 Unit: $U29 [05-20-06 18:16:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN58 CRAWFORD v. WASHINGTONOpinion of the CourtEven our recent cases, in their outcomes, hew closely tothe traditional line. Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U. S., at 67-70, admitted testimony from a preliminary hearing at which thedefendant had examined the witness. Lilly v. Virginia,supra, excluded testimonial statements that the defendanthad had no opportunity to test by cross-examination. AndBourjaily v. United States, 483 U. S. 171, 181-184 (1987), ad-mitted statements made unwittingly to a Federal Bureau ofInvestigation informant after applying a more general testthat didnot make prior cross-examination an indispensablerequirement.8Lee v. Illinois, 476 U. S. 530 (1986), on which the Staterelies, is not to the contrary. There, we rejected the State'sattempt to admit an accomplice confession. The State hadargued that the confession was admissible because it "interlocked" with the defendant's. We dealt with the argumentby rejecting its premise, holding that "when the discrepancies between the statements are not insignificant, thecodefendant's confession may not be admitted."Id., at 545.Respondent argues that "[t]he logical inference of this state8 One case arguably in tension with the rule requiring a prior opportunity for cross-examination when the proffered statement is testimonial isWhite v. Illinois, 502 U. S. 346 (1992), which involved, inter alia, statements of a child victim to an investigating police officer admitted as spontaneous declarations. Id., at 349-351. It is questionable whether testimonial statements would ever have been admissible on that ground in1791; to the extent the hearsay exception for spontaneous declarationsexisted at all, it required that the statements be made "immediat[ely] uponthe hurt received, and before [the declarant] had time to devise or contriveany thing for her own advantage." Thompson v. Trevanion, Skin. 402,90 Eng. Rep. 179 (K. B. 1693). In any case, the only question presentedin White was whether the Confrontation Clause imposed an unavailabilityrequirement on the types of hearsay at issue. See 502 U. S., at 348-349.The holding did not address the question whether certain of the statements, because they were testimonial, had to be excluded even if thewitness was unavailable. We "[took] as a given . . . that the testimonyproperly falls within the relevant hearsay exceptions." Id., at 351, n. 4.541US1 Unit: $U29 [05-20-06 18:16:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN59Cite as: 541 U. S. 36 (2004)Opinion of the Courtment is that when the discrepancies between the statementsare insignificant, then the codefendant's statement may beadmitted." Brief for Respondent 6. But this is merely apossible inference, not an inevitable one, and we do not drawit here. If Lee had meant authoritatively to announce anexception--previously unknown to this Court's jurisprudence--for interlocking confessions, it would not have doneso in such an oblique manner. Our only precedent on interlocking confessions had addressed the entirely differentquestion whether a limiting instruction cured prejudice tocodefendants from admitting a defendant'sown confessionagainst him in a joint trial. See Parker v. Randolph, 442U. S. 62, 69-76 (1979) (plurality opinion), abrogated byCruzv. New York, 481 U. S. 186 (1987).Our cases have thus remained faithful to the Framers' understanding: Testimonial statements of witnesses absentfrom trial have been admitted only where the declarant isunavailable, and only where the defendant has had a prioropportunity to cross-examine.99 The Chief Justice complains that our prior decisions have "neverdrawn a distinction" like the one we now draw, citing in particular Mattoxv. United States, 156 U. S. 237 (1895), Kirby v. United States, 174 U. S. 47(1899), and United States v. Burr, 25 F. Cas. 187 (No. 14,694) (CC Va. 1807)(Marshall, C. J.). Post, at 71-72. But nothing in these cases contradictsour holding in any way. Mattox and Kirby allowed or excluded evidencedepending on whether the defendant had had an opportunity for crossexamination. Mattox, supra, at 242-244; Kirby, supra, at 55-61. Thatthe two cases did not extrapolate a more general class of evidence to whichthat criterion applied does not prevent us from doing so now. As to Burr,we disagree with The Chief Justice's reading of the case. AlthoughChief Justice Marshall made one passing reference to the ConfrontationClause, the case was fundamentally about the hearsay rules governingstatements in furtherance of a conspiracy. The "principle so truly important" on which "inroad[s]" had been introduced was the "rule of evidencewhich rejects mere hearsay testimony." See 25 F. Cas., at 193. Nothingin the opinion concedes exceptions to the Confrontation Clause's exclusionof testimonial statements as we use the term. The Chief Justice fails541US1 Unit: $U29 [05-20-06 18:16:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN60 CRAWFORD v. WASHINGTONOpinion of the CourtVAlthough the results of our decisions have generally beenfaithful to the original meaning of the Confrontation Clause,the same cannot be said of our rationales.Roberts conditions the admissibility of all hearsay evidence on whetherit falls under a "firmly rooted hearsay exception" or bears"particularized guarantees of trustworthiness." 448 U. S.,at 66. This test departs from the historical principles identified above in two respects. First, it is too broad: It appliesthe same mode of analysis whether or not the hearsay consists of ex parte testimony. This often results in close constitutional scrutiny in cases that are far removed from thecore concerns of the Clause. At the same time, however,the test is too narrow: It admits statements that do consist ofex parte testimony upon a mere finding of reliability. Thismalleable standard often fails to protect against paradigmatic confrontation violations.Members of this Court and academics have suggested thatwe revise our doctrine to reflect more accurately the originalunderstanding of the Clause. See, e. g., Lilly, 527 U. S., at140-143 (Breyer, J., concurring); White, 502 U. S., at 366to identify a single case (aside from one minor, arguable exception, seesupra, at 58, n. 8), where we have admitted testimonial statements basedon indicia of reliability other than a prior opportunity for crossexamination. If nothing else, the test we announce is an empirically accurate explanation of the results our cases have reached.Finally, we reiterate that, when the declarant appears for crossexamination at trial, the Confrontation Clause places no constraints at allon the use of his prior testimonial statements. See California v. Green,399 U. S. 149, 162 (1970). It is therefore irrelevant that the reliability ofsome out-of-court statements " `cannot be replicated, even if the declaranttestifies to the same matters in court.' " Post, at 74 (quoting UnitedStates v. Inadi, 475 U. S. 387, 395 (1986)). The Clause does not bar admission of a statement so long as the declarant is present at trial to defendor explain it. (The Clause also does not bar the use of testimonial statements for purposes other than establishing the truth of the matter asserted. See Tennessee v. Street, 471 U. S. 409, 414 (1985).)541US1 Unit: $U29 [05-20-06 18:16:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN61Cite as: 541 U.

Amar, The Constitution and Criminal Procedure 125-131 (1997); Friedman, Confrontation: TheSearch for Basic Principles, 86 Geo. L. J. 1011 (1998). Theyoffer two proposals: First, that we apply the ConfrontationClause only to testimonial statements, leaving the remainderto regulation by hearsay law--thus eliminating the over-breadth referred to above. Second, that we impose an absolute bar to statements that are testimonial, absent a prioropportunity to cross-examine--thus eliminating the excessive narrowness referred to above.InWhite, we considered the first proposal and rejected it.502 U. S., at 352-353. Although our analysis in this casecasts doubt on that holding, we need not definitively resolvewhether it survives our decision today, because Sylvia Crawford's statement is testimonial under any definition. Thiscase does, however, squarely implicate the second proposal.AWhere testimonial statements are involved, we do notthink the Framers meant to leave the Sixth Amendment'sprotection to the vagaries of the rules of evidence, much lessto amorphous notions of "reliability." Certainly none of theauthorities discussed above acknowledges any general relia-bility exception to the common-law rule. Admitting statements deemed reliable by a judge is fundamentally at oddswith the right of confrontation. To be sure, the Clause'sultimate goal is to ensure reliability of evidence, but it is aprocedural rather than a substantive guarantee. It commands, not that evidence be reliable, but that reliability beassessed in a particular manner: by testing in the crucible ofcross-examination. The Clause thus reflects a judgment,not only about the desirability of reliable evidence (a pointon which there could be little dissent), but about how reliabil-ity can best be determined. Cf. 3 Blackstone, Commentaries, at 373 ("This open examination of witnesses . . . is541US1 Unit: $U29 [05-20-06 18:16:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN62 CRAWFORD v. WASHINGTONOpinion of the Courtmuch more conducive to the clearing up of truth"); M. Hale,History and Analysis of the Common Law of England 258(1713) (adversarial testing "beats and bolts out the Truthmuch better").The Roberts test allows a jury to hear evidence, untestedby the adversary process, based on a mere judicial determination of reliability. It thus replaces the constitutionallyprescribed method of assessing reliability with a wholly foreign one. In this respect, it is very different from excep-tions to the Confrontation Clause that make no claim tobe a surrogate means of assessing reliability. For exam-ple, the rule of forfeiture by wrongdoing (which we accept)extinguishes confrontation claims on essentially equitablegrounds; it does not purport to be an alternative means ofdetermining reliability. See Reynolds v. United States, 98U. S. 145, 158-159 (1879).The Raleigh trial itself involved the very sorts of reliabil-ity determinations thatRoberts authorizes. In the face ofRaleigh's repeated demands for confrontation, the prosecution responded with many of the arguments a court applyingRoberts might invoke today: that Cobham's statements wereself-inculpatory, 2 How. St. Tr., at 19, that they were notmade in the heat of passion, id., at 14, and that they werenot "extracted from [him] upon any hopes or promise of Pardon," id., at 29. It is not plausible that the Framers' onlyobjection to the trial was that Raleigh's judges did not properly weigh these factors before sentencing him to death.Rather, the problem was that the judges refused to allowRaleigh to confront Cobham in court, where he could cross-examine him and try to expose his accusation as a lie.Dispensing with confrontation because testimony is obvi-ously reliable is akin to dispensing with jury trial because adefendant is obviously guilty. This is not what the SixthAmendment prescribes.BThe legacy of Roberts in other courts vindicates the Fram-ers' wisdom in rejecting a general reliability exception.541US1 Unit: $U29 [05-20-06 18:16:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN63Cite as: 541 U. S. 36 (2004)Opinion of the CourtThe framework is so unpredictable that it fails to pro-vide meaningful protection from even core confrontationviolations.Reliability is an amorphous, if not entirely subjective, concept. There are countless factors bearing on whether astatement is reliable; the nine-factor balancing test appliedby the Court of Appeals below is representative. See, e. g.,People v. Farrell, 34 P. 3d 401, 406-407 (Colo. 2001) (eight-factor test). Whether a statement is deemed reliable depends heavily on which factors the judge considers and howmuch weight he accords each of them. Some courts windup attaching the same significance to opposite facts. Forexample, the Colorado Supreme Court held a statement morereliable because its inculpation of the defendant was "de-tailed,"id., at 407, while the Fourth Circuit found a statement more reliable because the portion implicating anotherwas "fleeting,"United States v. Photogrammetric DataServs., Inc., 259 F. 3d 229, 245 (2001). The Virginia Courtof Appeals found a statement more reliable because the witness was in custody and charged with a crime (thus makingthe statement more obviously against her penal interest), seeNowlin v.

Kirst,Appellate Court Answers to the Confrontation Questions inLilly v. Virginia, 53 Syracuse L. Rev. 87, 105 (2003). Courtshave invoked Roberts to admit other sorts of plainly testimonial statements despite the absence of any opportunity tocross-examine. See United States v.

S. 36 (2004)Opinion of the Court191, 650 N. W. 2d, at 918-920 (prior trial testimony); State v.McNeill, 140 N. C. App. 450, 457-460, 537 S. E. 2d 518, 523-524 (2000) (same).To add insult to injury, some of the courts that admituntested testimonial statements find reliability in the veryfactors that make the statements testimonial. As notedearlier, one court relied on the fact that the witness's state-ment was made to police while in custody on pendingcharges--the theory being that this made the statementmore clearly against penal interest and thus more reliable.Nowlin, supra, at 335-338, 579 S. E. 2d, at 371-372. Othercourts routinely rely on the fact that a prior statement isgiven under oath in judicial proceedings. E. g., Gallego,supra, at 168 (plea allocution); Papajohn, supra, at 1120(grand jury testimony). That inculpating statements aregiven in a testimonial setting is not an antidote to the con-frontation problem, but rather the trigger that makes theClause's demands most urgent. It is not enough to point outthat most of the usual safeguards of the adversary processattend the statement, when the single safeguard missing isthe one the Confrontation Clause demands.CRoberts' failings were on full display in the proceedingsbelow. Sylvia Crawford made her statement while in policecustody, herself a potential suspect in the case. Indeed, shehad been told that whether she would be released "depend[ed] on how the investigation continues." App. 81. Inresponse to often leading questions from police detectives,she implicated her husband in Lee's stabbing and at leastarguably undermined his self-defense claim. Despite allthis, the trial court admitted her statement, listing sev-eral reasons why it was reliable. In its opinion reversing,the Court of Appeals listed several other reasons why thestatement wasnot reliable. Finally, the State SupremeCourt relied exclusively on the interlocking character of the541US1 Unit: $U29 [05-20-06 18:16:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN66 CRAWFORD v. WASHINGTONOpinion of the Courtstatement and disregarded every other factor the lowercourts had considered. The case is thus a self-containeddemonstration of Roberts' unpredictable and inconsistentapplication.Each of the courts also made assumptions that cross-examination might well have undermined. The trial court,for example, stated that Sylvia Crawford's statement wasreliable because she was an eyewitness with direct knowl-edge of the events. But Sylvia at one point told the policethat she had "shut [her] eyes and . . . didn't really watch"part of the fight, and that she was "in shock." App. 134.The trial court also buttressed its reliability finding by claiming that Sylvia was "being questioned by law enforcement,and, thus, the [questioner] is . . . neutral to her and not someone who would be inclined to advance her interests andshade her version of the truth unfavorably toward the defendant." Id., at 77. The Framers would be astounded tolearn that ex parte testimony could be admitted against acriminal defendant because it was elicited by "neutral" government officers. But even if the court's assessment of theofficer's motives was accurate, it says nothing about Sylvia'sperception of her situation. Only cross-examination couldreveal that.The State Supreme Court gave dispositive weight to theinterlocking nature of the two statements--that they wereboth ambiguous as to when and whether Lee had a weapon.The court's claim that the two statements were equally ambiguous is hard to accept. Petitioner's statement is ambiguous only in the sense that he had lingering doubts abouthis recollection: "A. I could a swore I seen him goin' forsomethin' before, right before everything happened. . . . [B]utI'm not positive." Id., at 155. Sylvia's statement, on theother hand, is truly inscrutable, since the key timing detailwas simply assumed in the leading question she was asked:"Q. Did Kenny do anything to fight back from this assault?"Id., at 137 (punctuation added). Moreover, Sylvia specifi541US1 Unit: $U29 [05-20-06 18:16:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN67Cite as: 541 U. S. 36 (2004)Opinion of the Courtcally said Lee had nothing in his hands after he was stabbed,while petitioner was not asked about that.The prosecutor obviously did not share the court's viewthat Sylvia's statement was ambiguous--he called it "damning evidence" that "completely refutes [petitioner's] claim ofself-defense." Tr. 468 (Oct. 21, 1999). We have no way ofknowing whether the jury agreed with the prosecutor or thecourt. Far from obviating the need for cross-examination,the "interlocking" ambiguity of the two statements made itall the more imperative that they be tested to tease out thetruth.We readily concede that we could resolve this case by simply reweighing the "reliability factors" under Roberts andfinding that Sylvia Crawford's statement falls short. Butwe view this as one of those rare cases in which the resultbelow is so improbable that it reveals a fundamental failureon our part to interpret the Constitution in a way that secures its intended constraint on judicial discretion. Moreover, to reverse the Washington Supreme Court's decisionafter conducting our own reliability analysis would perpetuate, not avoid, what the Sixth Amendment condemns. TheConstitution prescribes a procedure for determining thereliability of testimony in criminal trials, and we, no less thanthe state courts, lack authority to replace it with one of ourown devising.We have no doubt that the courts below were acting inutmost good faith when they found reliability. The Framers, however, would not have been content to indulge thisassumption. They knew that judges, like other governmentofficers, could not always be trusted to safeguard the rightsof the people; the likes of the dread Lord Jeffreys were notyet too distant a memory. They were loath to leave toomuch discretion in judicial hands. Cf. U. S. Const., Amdt. 6(criminal jury trial); Amdt. 7 (civil jury trial); Ring v. Arizona, 536 U. S. 584, 611-612 (2002) (Scalia, J., concurring).By replacing categorical constitutional guarantees with541US1 Unit: $U29 [05-20-06 18:16:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN68 CRAWFORD v. WASHINGTONOpinion of the Courtopen-ended balancing tests, we do violence to their design.Vague standards are manipulable, and, while that might bea small concern in run-of-the-mill assault prosecutions likethis one, the Framers had an eye toward politically chargedcases like Raleigh's--great state trials where the impartial-ity of even those at the highest levels of the judiciary mightnot be so clear. It is difficult to imagine Roberts' providingany meaningful protection in those circumstances.* * *Where nontestimonial hearsay is at issue, it is wholly con-sistent with the Framers' design to afford the States flexibility in their development of hearsay law--as does Roberts,and as would an approach that exempted such statementsfrom Confrontation Clause scrutiny altogether. Where tes-timonial evidence is at issue, however, the Sixth Amendmentdemands what the common law required: unavailability anda prior opportunity for cross-examination. We leave for another day any effort to spell out a comprehensive definitionof "testimonial."10 Whatever else the term covers, it applies at a minimum to prior testimony at a preliminary hear-ing, before a grand jury, or at a former trial; and to policeinterrogations. These are the modern practices with closestkinship to the abuses at which the Confrontation Clausewas directed.In this case, the State admitted Sylvia's testimonial statement against petitioner, despite the fact that he had noopportunity to cross-examine her. That alone is sufficientto make out a violation of the Sixth Amendment. Robertsnotwithstanding, we decline to mine the record in search ofindicia of reliability. Where testimonial statements are at10 We acknowledge The Chief Justice's objection, post, at 75-76, thatour refusal to articulate a comprehensive definition in this case will causeinterim uncertainty. But it can hardly be any worse than the status quo.See supra, at 63-67, and cases cited. The difference is that the Robertstest is inherently, and therefore permanently, unpredictable.541US1 Unit: $U29 [05-20-06 18:16:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN69Cite as: 541 U. S. 36 (2004)Rehnquist, C. J., concurring in judgmentissue, the only indicium of reliability sufficient to satisfy con-stitutional demands is the one the Constitution actually prescribes: confrontation.The judg ment of the Washington Supreme Court isreversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedingsnot inconsistent with this opinion.
