This case presents a narrow question: Does $ 106(c) of theBankruptcy Code waive the sovereign immunity of theUnited States from an action seeking monetary recovery inbankruptcy?IRespondent Nordic Village, Inc., filed a petition for reliefunder Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in March 1984.About four months later, Josef Lah, an officer and share-holder of Nordic Village, drew a $26,000 check on the company's corporate account, $20,000 of which was used to obtaina cashier's check in that amount payable to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Lah delivered this check to the IRSand directed it to apply the funds against his individual taxliability, which it did.In December 1984, the trustee appointed for Nordic Village commenced an adversary proceeding in the BankruptcyCourt for the Northern District of Ohio, seeking to recover,among other transfers, the $20,000 paid by Lah to the IRS.The Bankruptcy Court permitted the recovery. The unauthorized, postpetition transfer, the court determined, couldbe avoided under $ 549(a) and recovered from the IRS under$ 550(a) of the Bankruptcy Code. It entered a judgmentagainst the IRS in the amount of $20,000, which the DistrictCourt affirmed.503us1$33K 11-14-95 18:56:50 PAGES OPINPGT32 UNITED STATES v. NORDIC VILLAGE, INC.Opinion of the CourtA divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals forthe Sixth Circuit affirmed. 915 F. 2d 1049 (1990). It upheldthe reasoning of the lower courts and rejected a jurisdictional defense (raised for the first time on appeal) that sovereign immunity barred the judgment entered against the Government. We granted certiorari. 501 U. S. 1216 (1991).IISection 106 of the Bankruptcy Code provides:"(a) A governmental unit is deemed to have waivedsovereign immunity with respect to any claim againstsuch governmental unit that is property of the estateand that arose out of the same transaction or occurrenceout of which such governmental unit's claim arose."(b) There shall be offset against an allowed claim orinterest of a governmental unit any claim against suchgovernmental unit that is property of the estate."(c) Except as provided in subsections (a) and (b) ofthis section and notwithstanding any assertion of sovereign immunity--"(1) a provision of this title that contains `creditor,'`entity,' or `governmental unit' applies to governmentalunits; and"(2) a determination by the court of an issue arisingunder such a provision binds governmental units." 11U. S. C. $ 106.Three Terms ago we construed this provision in Hoffmanv. Connecticut Dept. of Income Maintenance, 492 U. S. 96(1989). The issue there was whether $ 106(c) authorizes amonetary recovery against a State. We held that it doesnot, though the Justices supporting that judgment failed toagree as to why. A plurality of the Court determined that$ 106(c) does not permit a bankruptcy court to issue mone503us1$33K 11-14-95 18:56:50 PAGES OPINPGT33Cite as: 503 U. S. 30 (1992)Opinion of the Courttary relief against a State. Id., at 102 (White, J., joined byRehnquist, C. J., and O'Connor and Kennedy, JJ.). Thatconclusion, the plurality said, was compelled by the languageof $ 106(c), the relationship between that subsection and therest of the statute, and the requirement that congressionalabrogation of the States' Eleventh Amendment immunity beclearly expressed. The concurrence found it unnecessary toconstrue the statute, concluding that Congress lacks author-ity under the Bankruptcy Clause to abrogate the States' immunity from money-damages actions. Id., at 105 (Scalia,J., concurring in judgment). Like the Court of Appealshere, a dissent determined that the language of $ 106(c),particularly that of paragraph (c)(1), supplies the necessarywaiver. Id., at 106 (Marshall, J., joined by Brennan,Blackmun, and Stevens, JJ.).Contrary to the Government's suggestion, Hoffman doesnot control today's decision. It is true, to be sure, that Con-gress made clear in $ 106 that (insofar as is within Congress'power) state and federal sovereigns are to be treated thesame for immunity purposes. See 11 U. S. C. $ 101(27) (1982ed., Supp. II) (" `governmental unit' means United States[and] State"). Since, however, the Court inHoffman wasevenly divided over what that treatment was as to theStates; and since the deciding vote of the concurrence, deny-ing amenability to suit, rested upon a ground (the EleventhAmendment) applicable only to the States and not to theFederal Government, seeFederal Housing Authority v.Burr, 309 U. S. 242, 244 (1940); the holding in Hoffman hasno binding force here. The separate opinions dealing withthe statutory question are relevant, however, and we shallin fact rely on the reasoning of the plurality.IIIWaivers of the Government's sovereign immunity, to beeffective, must be " `unequivocally expressed.' "Irwin v.503us1$33K 11-14-95 18:56:50 PAGES OPINPGT34 UNITED STATES v. NORDIC VILLAGE, INC.Opinion of the CourtDepartment of Veterans Affairs, 498 U. S. 89, 95 (1990)(quotingUnited States v. Mitchell, 445 U. S. 535, 538 (1980),and United States v. King, 395 U. S. 1, 4 (1969)). Contraryto respondent's suggestion, moreover, they are not generallyto be "liberally construed." We have on occasion narrowlyconstrued exceptions to waivers of sovereign immunitywhere that was consistent with Congress' clear intent, as inthe context of the "sweeping language" of the Federal TortClaims Act,United States v. Yellow Cab Co., 340 U. S. 543,547 (1951), see, e. g., id., at 554-555, Block v. Neal, 460 U. S.289, 298 (1983),United States v. Aetna Casualty & SuretyCo., 338 U. S. 366, 383 (1949), or as in the context of equallybroad "sue and be sued" clauses, see, e. g., Franchise Tax Bd.of California v. United States Postal Service, 467 U. S. 512,517-519 (1984), FHA v. Burr, supra, at 245. These casesdo not, however, eradicate the traditional principle that theGovernment's consent to be sued "must be `construed strictlyin favor of the sovereign,' McMahon v. United States, 342U. S. 25, 27 (1951), and not `enlarge[d] . . . beyond whatthe language requires,' " Ruckelshaus v. Sierra Club, 463U. S. 680, 685 (1983) (quoting Eastern Transportation Co. v.United States, 272 U. S. 675, 686 (1927)), a rule of construction that we have had occasion to reaffirm once already thisTerm, see Ardestani v. INS, 502 U. S. 129, 137 (1991).Subsections (a) and (b) of $ 106 meet this "unequivocal expression" requirement with respect to monetary liability.Addressing "claim[s]," which the Code defines as "right[s] topayment," $ 101(4)(A), they plainly waive sovereign immunity with regard to monetary relief in two settings: compulsory counterclaims to governmental claims, $ 106(a); and permissive counterclaims to governmental claims capped by asetoff limitation, $ 106(b). Next to these models of claritystands subsection (c). Though it, too, waives sovereign immunity, it fails to establish unambiguously that the waiverextends to monetary claims. It is susceptible of at least twointerpretations that do not authorize monetary relief.503us1$33K 11-14-95 18:56:50 PAGES OPINPGT35Cite as: 503 U. S. 30 (1992)Opinion of the CourtUnder one interpretation, $ 106(c) permits the bankruptcycourt to issue "declaratory and injunctive"--though not monetary--relief against the Government. Hoffman, 492 U. S.,at 102. This conclusion is reached by reading the two paragraphs of subsection (c) as complementary rather than independent: The first paragraph identifies the subject matter ofdisputes that courts may entertain under the subsection andthe second paragraph describes the relief that courts maygrant in such disputes. That is to say, the second paragraphspecifies the manner in which there shall be applied to gov-ernmental units the provisions identified by the first paragraph, i. e., a manner that permits declaratory or injunctiverelief but not an affirmative monetary recovery.Several factors favor this construction. The distinction itestablishes--between suits for monetary claims and suits forother relief--is a familiar one, and is suggested by the contrasting language used in subsections (a) and (b) ("claim[s]")and in subsection (c) ("determination[s]" of "issue[s]"), Hoffman, 492 U. S., at 102. It also avoids eclipsing the carefullydrawn limitations placed on the waivers in subsections (a)and (b). The principal provision of the Code permitting theassertion of claims against persons other than the estate itself is $ 542(b), which provides that "an entity that owes adebt that is property of the estate and that is matured, payable on demand, or payable on order, shall pay such debt to,or on the order of, the trustee." If the first paragraph of$ 106(c) means that, by reason of use of the trigger word "entity," this provision applies in all respects to governmentalunits, then the Government may be sued on all alleged debts,despite the prior specification in subsections (a) and (b) thatclaims against the Government will lie only when the Government has filed a proof of claim, and even then only as asetoff unless the claim is a compulsory counterclaim. Thoseearlier limitations are reduced to trivial application if paragraph (c)(1) stands on its own. See id., at 101-102. Thisconstruction also attaches practical consequences to para503us1$33K 11-14-95 18:56:50 PAGES OPINPGT36 UNITED STATES v. NORDIC VILLAGE, INC.Opinion of the Courtgraph (c)(2), whereas respondent's interpretation violates thesettled rule that a statute must, if possible, be construed insuch fashion that every word has some operative effect. Seeid., at 103; United States v. Menasche, 348 U. S. 528, 538-539(1955). Respondent has suggested no function to be performed by paragraph (2) if paragraph (1) operates to treatthe Government like any other "entity" or "creditor," regardless of the type of relief authorized by an applicable Codeprovision.Under this interpretation, $ 106(c), though not authorizingclaims for monetary relief, would nevertheless perform a significant function. It would permit a bankruptcy court to determine the amount and dischargeability of an estate's liability to the Government, such as unpaid federal taxes, see 11U. S. C. $ 505(a)(1) (permitting the court to "determine theamount or legality of any tax") (emphasis added), whether ornot the Government filed a proof of claim. See 492 U. S., at102-103. Cf. Neavear v. Schweiker, 674 F. 2d 1201, 1203-1204 (CA7 1982) (holding that under $ 106(c) a bankruptcycourt could discharge a debt owed to the Social Security Administration). The Government had repeatedly objected, ongrounds of sovereign immunity, to being bound by such determinations before $ 106(c) was enacted in 1978. See, e. g.,McKenzie v. United States, 536 F. 2d 726, 728-729 (CA71976); Bostwick v. United States, 521 F. 2d 741, 742-744 (CA81975); Gwilliam v. United States, 519 F. 2d 407, 410 (CA91975); In re Durensky, 377 F. Supp. 798, 799-800 (ND Tex.1974), appeal dism'd, 519 F. 2d 1024 (CA5 1975).Subsection (c) is also susceptible of another constructionthat would not permit recovery here. If the two paragraphsof $ 106(c) are read as being independent, rather than thesecond as limiting the first, then, pursuant to the first paragraph, Code provisions using the triggering words enumerated in paragraph (c)(1) would apply fully to governmentalunits. But that application of those provisions would be limited by the requirements of subsections (a) and (b), in accord503us1$33K 11-14-95 18:56:50 PAGES OPINPGT37Cite as: 503 U. S. 30 (1992)Opinion of the Courtance with the phrase that introduces subsection (c) ("Exceptas provided in subsections (a) and (b) of this section"). Thisexception, in other words, could be read to mean that therules established in subsections (a) and (b) for waiver of Government "claim[s]" that are "property of the estate" are ex-clusive, and preclude any resort to subsection (c) for thatpurpose. That reading would bar the present suit, since theright to recover a postpetition transfer under $ 550 is clearlya "claim" (defined in $ 101(4)(A)) and is "property of the es-tate" (defined in $ 541(a)(3)). (The dissent appears to readparagraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) as being independent but pro-vides no explanation of what the textual exception couldmean under that reading.)The foregoing are assuredly not the only readings of subsection (c), but they are plausible ones--which is enough toestablish that a reading imposing monetary liability on theGovernment is not "unambiguous" and therefore should notbe adopted. Contrary to respondent's suggestion, legislative history has no bearing on the ambiguity point. As inthe Eleventh Amendment context, seeHoffman, supra, at104, the "unequivocal expression" of elimination of sovereignimmunity that we insist upon is an expression in statutorytext. If clarity does not exist there, it cannot be suppliedby a committee report. Cf. Dellmuth v. Muth, 491 U. S. 223,228-229 (1989).IVRespondent proposes several alternative grounds for af-firming the judgment below, all unpersuasive. First, itclaims that the necessary waiver can be found in 28 U. S. C.$ 1334(d), which grants the district court in which a bankruptcy case is initiated "exclusive jurisdiction of all of theproperty, wherever located, of the debtor as of the commencement of such case, and of property of the estate." Re-spondent urges us to construe this language as empoweringa bankruptcy court to compel the United States or a Stateto return any property, including money, that passes into the503us1$33K 11-14-95 18:56:50 PAGES OPINPGT38 UNITED STATES v. NORDIC VILLAGE, INC.Opinion of the Courtestate upon commencement of the bankruptcy proceed-ing. Under this theory, a sovereign's exposure to suitwould not be governed by the specific language of $ 106,but would be concealed in the broad jurisdictional grantof $ 1334(d). Besides being unprecedented and runningafoul of the unequivocal-expression requirement, this theoryclosely resembles an argument we rejected just last Term.In Blatchford v. Native Village of Noatak, 501 U. S. 775,786 (1991), the argument was made that Alaska's EleventhAmendment immunity to suit was abrogated by 28 U. S. C.$ 1362, a jurisdictional grant, akin to $ 1334(d), that gives district courts jurisdiction over "all civil actions, brought byany Indian tribe . . . aris[ing] under the Constitution, laws,or treaties of the United States." Rejecting that contention, we observed: "The fact that Congress grants jurisdiction to hear a claim does not suffice to show Congress hasabrogated all defenses to that claim. The issues are whollydistinct." Id., at 787, n. 4.Equally unpersuasive is respondent's related argumentthat a bankruptcy court's in rem jurisdiction overrides sovereign immunity. As an initial matter, the premise for thatargument is missing here, since respondent did not invoke,and the Bankruptcy Court did not purport to exercise, inrem jurisdiction. Respondent sought to recover a sum ofmoney, not "particular dollars," cf. Begier v. IRS, 496 U. S.53, 62 (1990) (emphasis deleted), so there was no res to whichthe court's in rem jurisdiction could have attached, see Pennsylvania Turnpike Comm'n v. McGinnes, 268 F. 2d 65, 66-67(CA3), cert. denied, 361 U. S. 829 (1959). In any event, wehave never applied an in rem exception to the sovereignimmunity bar against monetary recovery, and have suggested that no such exception exists, see United States v.Shaw, 309 U. S. 495, 502-503 (1940). Nor does United Statesv. Whiting Pools, Inc., 462 U. S. 198 (1983), establish suchan exception, or otherwise permit the relief requested here.That case upheld a Bankruptcy Court order that the IRS503us1$33K 11-14-95 18:56:50 PAGES OPINPGT39Cite as: 503 U. S. 30 (1992)Stevens, J., dissentingturn over tangible property of the debtor it had seized beforethe debtor filed for bankruptcy protection. A suit for payment of funds from the Treasury is quite different from asuit for the return of tangible property in which the debtorretained ownership. The Court's opinion in Whiting Poolscontains no discussion of $ 106(c), and nothing in it suggeststhat an order granting monetary recovery from the UnitedStates would be proper.Resort to the principles of trust law is also of no help torespondent. Most of the trust decisions respondent citesare irrelevant, since they involve private entities, not theGovernment. The one that does involve the Government,Bull v. United States, 295 U. S. 247 (1935), concerns equitablerecoupment, a doctrine that has been substantially narrowedby later cases, see United States v. Dalm, 494 U. S. 596, 608(1990), and has no application here.* * *Neither $ 106(c) nor any other provision of law establishesan unequivocal textual waiver of the Government's immunityfrom a bankruptcy trustee's claims for monetary relief.Since Congress has not empowered a bankruptcy court toorder a recovery of money from the United States, the judg-ment of the Court of Appeals must be reversed.
