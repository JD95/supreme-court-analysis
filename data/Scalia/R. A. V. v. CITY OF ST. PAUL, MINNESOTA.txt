Thatcourt rejected petitioner's overbreadth claim because, asconstrued in prior Minnesota cases, see, e. g., In re Welfareof S. L. J., 263 N. W. 2d 412 (Minn. 1978), the modifyingphrase "arouses anger, alarm or resentment in others" lim-ited the reach of the ordinance to conduct that amounts to"fighting words," i. e., "conduct that itself inflicts injury ortends to incite immediate violence . . . ,"In re Welfare ofR.

W. 2d, at 511. Thecourt also concluded that the ordinance was not impermissibly content based because, in its view, "the ordinance is anarrowly tailored means toward accomplishing the compelling governmental interest in protecting the communityagainst bias-motivated threats to public safety and order."Ibid. We granted certiorari, 501 U. S. 1204 (1991).IIn construing the St. Paul ordinance, we are bound by theconstruction given to it by the Minnesota court. Posadasde Puerto Rico Associates v. Tourism Co. of Puerto Rico,478 U. S. 328, 339 (1986); New York v. Ferber, 458 U. S. 747,769, n. 24 (1982); Terminiello v. Chicago, 337 U. S. 1, 4 (1949).Accordingly, we accept the Minnesota Supreme Court's authoritative statement that the ordinance reaches only thoseexpressions that constitute "fighting words" within themeaning of Chaplinsky. 464 N. W. 2d, at 510-511. Peti-tioner and hisamici urge us to modify the scope of theChaplinsky formulation, thereby invalidating the ordinanceas "substantially overbroad," Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413U. S. 601, 610 (1973). We find it unnecessary to considerthis issue. Assuming, arguendo, that all of the expressionreached by the ordinance is proscribable under the "fightingwords" doctrine, we nonetheless conclude that the ordinanceis facially unconstitutional in that it prohibits otherwise permitted speech solely on the basis of the subjects the speechaddresses.33 Contrary to Justice White's suggestion, post, at 397-398, n. 1, petitioner's claim is "fairly included" within the questions presented in thepetition for certiorari, see this Court's Rule 14.1(a). It was clear from thepetition and from petitioner's other filings in this Court (and in the courtsbelow) that his assertion that the St. Paul ordinance "violat[es] overbreadth . . . principles of the First Amendment," Pet. for Cert. i, was not505US2105I 07-09-96 19:34:57 PAGES OPINPGT382 R.

S. 296, 309-311 (1940), or even expressive conduct,see, e. g., Texas v. Johnson, 491 U. S. 397, 406 (1989), becauseof disapproval of the ideas expressed. Content-based regulations are presumptively invalid. Simon & Schuster, Inc.v. Members of N. Y. State Crime Victims Bd., 502 U. S. 105,115 (1991); id., at 124 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment);Consolidated Edison Co. of N. Y. v. Public Serv. Comm'n ofN. Y., 447 U. S. 530, 536 (1980); Police Dept. of Chicago v.Mosley, 408 U. S. 92, 95 (1972). From 1791 to the present,however, our society, like other free but civilized societies,has permitted restrictions upon the content of speech in ajust a technical "overbreadth" claim--i. e., a claim that the ordinance violated the rights of too many third parties--but included the contentionthat the ordinance was "overbroad" in the sense of restricting more speechthan the Constitution permits, even in its application to him, because it iscontent based. An important component of petitioner's argument is, andhas been all along, that narrowly construing the ordinance to cover only"fighting words" cannot cure this fundamental defect. Id., at 12, 14, 15-16. In his briefs in this Court, petitioner argued that a narrowing construction was ineffective because (1) its boundaries were vague, Brief forPetitioner 26, and because (2) denominating particular expression a "fighting word" because of the impact of its ideological content upon the audience is inconsistent with the First Amendment, Reply Brief for Petitioner5; id., at 13 ("[The ordinance] is overbroad, viewpoint discriminatory andvague as `narrowly construed' ") (emphasis added). At oral argument,counsel for petitioner reiterated this second point: "It is . . . one of mypositions, that in [punishing only some fighting words and not others],even though it is a subcategory, technically, of unprotected conduct, [theordinance] still is picking out an opinion, a disfavored message, and makingthat clear through the State." Tr. of Oral Arg. 8. In resting our judgment upon this contention, we have not departed from our criteria of whatis "fairly included" within the petition. See Arkansas Electric Cooperative Corp. v. Arkansas Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 461 U. S. 375, 382, n. 6 (1983);Brown v. Socialist Workers '74 Campaign Comm., 459 U. S. 87, 94, n. 9(1982); Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U.

We have recognizedthat "the freedom of speech" referred to by the FirstAmendment does not include a freedom to disregard thesetraditional limitations. See,e. g., Roth v. United States, 354U. S. 476 (1957) (obscenity); Beauharnais v. Illinois, 343 U. S.250 (1952) (defamation);Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire,supra (" `fighting' words"); see generally Simon & Schuster,supra, at 124 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment). Ourdecisions since the 1960's have narrowed the scope of thetraditional categorical exceptions for defamation, see NewYork Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254 (1964); Gertz v.Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U. S. 323 (1974); see generally Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co., 497 U. S. 1, 13-17 (1990), andfor obscenity, see Miller v. California, 413 U. S. 15 (1973),but a limited categorical approach has remained an important part of our First Amendment jurisprudence.We have sometimes said that these categories of expression are "not within the area of constitutionally protectedspeech," Roth, supra, at 483; Beauharnais, supra, at 266;Chaplinsky, supra, at 571-572, or that the "protection ofthe First Amendment does not extend" to them, Bose Corp.v. Consumers Union of United States, Inc., 466 U. S. 485,504 (1984); Sable Communications of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492U. S. 115, 124 (1989). Such statements must be taken in context, however, and are no more literally true than is the occasionally repeated shorthand characterizing obscenity "as notbeing speech at all," Sunstein, Pornography and the FirstAmendment, 1986 Duke L. J. 589, 615, n. 46. What theymean is that these areas of speech can, consistently with theFirst Amendment, be regulated because of their constitutionally proscribable content (obscenity, defamation, etc.)--not that they are categories of speech entirely invisible tothe Constitution, so that they may be made the vehicles for505US2105I 07-09-96 19:34:57 PAGES OPINPGT384 R. A. V. v. ST. PAULOpinion of the Courtcontent discrimination unrelated to their distinctively pro-scribable content. Thus, the government may proscribelibel; but it may not make the further content discriminationof proscribing only libel critical of the government. We recently acknowledged this distinction in Ferber, 458 U. S., at763, where, in upholding New York's child pornography law,we expressly recognized that there was no "question here ofcensoring a particular literary theme . . . ." See alsoid.,at 775 (O'Connor, J., concurring) ("As drafted, New York'sstatute does not attempt to suppress the communication ofparticular ideas").Our cases surely do not establish the proposition that theFirst Amendment imposes no obstacle whatsoever to regula-tion of particular instances of such proscribable expression,so that the government "may regulate [them] freely," post,at 400 (White, J., concurring in judgment). That wouldmean that a city council could enact an ordinance prohibitingonly those legally obscene works that contain criticism of thecity government or, indeed, that do not include endorsementof the city government. Such a simplistic, all-or-nothing-at-all approach to First Amendment protection is at odds withcommon sense and with our jurisprudence as well.4 It is4 Justice White concedes that a city council cannot prohibit only thoselegally obscene works that contain criticism of the city government, post,at 406, but asserts that to be the consequence, not of the First Amendment, but of the Equal Protection Clause. Such content-based discrimination would not, he asserts, "be rationally related to a legitimate government interest." Ibid. But of course the only reason that governmentinterest is not a "legitimate" one is that it violates the First Amendment.This Court itself has occasionally fused the First Amendment into theEqual Protection Clause in this fashion, but at least with the acknowledgment (which Justice White cannot afford to make) that the First Amendment underlies its analysis. See Police Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley, 408U. S. 92, 95 (1972) (ordinance prohibiting only nonlabor picketing violatedthe Equal Protection Clause because there was no "appropriate governmental interest" supporting the distinction inasmuch as "the First Amendment means that government has no power to restrict expression becauseof its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or its content"); Carey v.505US2105I 07-09-96 19:34:57 PAGES OPINPGT385Cite as: 505 U. S. 377 (1992)Opinion of the Courtnot true that "fighting words" have at most a "de minimis"expressive content, ibid., or that their content is in all respects "worthless and undeserving of constitutional protec-tion," post, at 401; sometimes they are quite expressive indeed. We have not said that they constitute "no part of theexpression of ideas," but only that they constitute "noessen-tial part of any exposition of ideas." Chaplinsky, supra, at572 (emphasis added).The proposition that a particular instance of speech can beproscribable on the basis of one feature (e. g., obscenity) butnot on the basis of another (e. g., opposition to the city government) is commonplace and has found application in manycontexts. We have long held, for example, that nonverbalexpressive activity can be banned because of the action itentails, but not because of the ideas it expresses--so thatburning a flag in violation of an ordinance against outdoorfires could be punishable, whereas burning a flag in violationof an ordinance against dishonoring the flag is not. SeeJohnson, 491 U. S., at 406-407. See also Barnes v. GlenTheatre, Inc., 501 U. S. 560, 569-570 (1991) (plurality opin-ion); id., at 573-574 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment);id., at 581-582 (Souter, J., concurring in judgment); UnitedBrown, 447 U. S. 455 (1980). See generally Simon & Schuster, Inc. v.Members of N. Y. State Crime Victims Bd., 502 U. S. 105, 124 (1991) (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment).Justice Stevens seeks to avoid the point by dismissing the notion ofobscene antigovernment speech as "fantastical," post, at 418, apparentlybelieving that any reference to politics prevents a finding of obscenity.Unfortunately for the purveyors of obscenity, that is obviously false. Ashockingly hardcore pornographic movie that contains a model sporting apolitical tattoo can be found, "taken as a whole, [to] lac[k] serious literary,artistic, political, or scientific value," Miller v. California, 413 U. S. 15, 24(1973) (emphasis added). Anyway, it is easy enough to come up with otherillustrations of a content-based restriction upon "unprotected speech"that is obviously invalid: the antigovernment libel illustration mentionedearlier, for one. See supra, at 384. And of course the concept of racistfighting words is, unfortunately, anything but a "highly speculative hypothetica[l]," post, at 419.505US2105I 07-09-96 19:34:57 PAGES OPINPGT386 R. A. V. v. ST. PAULOpinion of the CourtStates v. O'Brien, 391 U. S. 367, 376-377 (1968). Similarly,we have upheld reasonable "time, place, or manner" restrictions, but only if they are "justified without reference to thecontent of the regulated speech." Ward v. Rock AgainstRacism, 491 U. S. 781, 791 (1989) (internal quotation marksomitted); see alsoClark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence, 468 U. S. 288, 298 (1984) (noting that the O'Brientest differs little from the standard applied to time, place, ormanner restrictions). And just as the power to proscribeparticular speech on the basis of a noncontent element (e. g.,noise) does not entail the power to proscribe the same speechon the basis of a content element; so also, the power to pro-scribe it on the basis ofone content element (e. g., obscenity)does not entail the power to proscribe it on the basis of othercontent elements.In other words, the exclusion of "fighting words" from thescope of the First Amendment simply means that, for pur-poses of that Amendment, the unprotected features of thewords are, despite their verbal character, essentially a "non-speech" element of communication. Fighting words arethus analogous to a noisy sound truck: Each is, as JusticeFrankfurter recognized, a "mode of speech,"Niemotko v.Maryland, 340 U. S. 268, 282 (1951) (opinion concurring inresult); both can be used to convey an idea; but neither has,in and of itself, a claim upon the First Amendment. As withthe sound truck, however, so also with fighting words: Thegovernment may not regulate use based on hostility--orfavoritism--towards the underlying message expressed.CompareFrisby v. Schultz, 487 U. S. 474 (1988) (upholding,against facial challenge, a content-neutral ban on targetedresidential picketing), with Carey v. Brown, 447 U. S. 455(1980) (invalidating a ban on residential picketing that exempted labor picketing).55 Although Justice White asserts that our analysis disregards "established principles of First Amendment law," post, at 415, he cites not asingle case (and we are aware of none) that even involved, much less con505US2105I 07-09-96 19:34:57 PAGES OPINPGT387Cite as: 505 U. S. 377 (1992)Opinion of the CourtThe concurrences describe us as setting forth a new FirstAmendment principle that prohibition of constitutionallyproscribable speech cannot be "underinclusiv[e]," post, at 402(White, J., concurring in judgment)--a First Amendment"absolutism" whereby "[w]ithin a particular `proscribable'category of expression, . . . a government must either pro-scribe all speech or no speech at all," post, at 419 (Stevens,J., concurring in judgment). That easy target is of the con-currences' own invention. In our view, the First Amendment imposes not an "underinclusiveness" limitation but a"content discrimination" limitation upon a State's prohibitionof proscribable speech. There is no problem whatever, forexample, with a State's prohibiting obscenity (and otherforms of proscribable expression) only in certain media ormarkets, for although that prohibition would be "underinclu-sive," it would not discriminate on the basis of content. See,e. g., Sable Communications, 492 U. S., at 124-126 (upholding47 U. S. C. $ 223(b)(1), which prohibits obscenetelephonecommunications).Even the prohibition against content discrimination thatwe assert the First Amendment requires is not absolute. Itapplies differently in the context of proscribable speech thanin the area of fully protected speech. The rationale of thegeneral prohibition, after all, is that content discrimination"raises the specter that the Government may effectivelydrive certain ideas or viewpoints from the marketplace,"Simon & Schuster, 502 U. S., at 116; Leathers v. Medlock,499 U. S. 439, 448 (1991); FCC v. League of Women Voters ofCal., 468 U. S. 364, 383-384 (1984); Consolidated Edison Co.,447 U. S., at 536; Police Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U. S.,sidered and resolved, the issue of content discrimination through regulation of "unprotected" speech--though we plainly recognized that as anissue in New York v. Ferber, 458 U. S. 747 (1982). It is of course contraryto all traditions of our jurisprudence to consider the law on this pointconclusively resolved by broad language in cases where the issue was notpresented or even envisioned.505US2105I 07-09-96 19:34:57 PAGES OPINPGT388 R. A. V. v. ST. PAULOpinion of the Courtat 95-98. But content discrimination among various in-stances of a class of proscribable speech often does not posethis threat.When the basis for the content discrimination consists entirely of the very reason the entire class of speech at issueis proscribable, no significant danger of idea or viewpointdiscrimination exists. Such a reason, having been adjudgedneutral enough to support exclusion of the entire class ofspeech from First Amendment protection, is also neutralenough to form the basis of distinction within the class. Toillustrate: A State might choose to prohibit only that obscenity which is the most patently offensive in its prurience--i. e., that which involves the most lascivious displays of sexual activity. But it may not prohibit, for example, only thatobscenity which includes offensive political messages. SeeKucharek v. Hanaway, 902 F. 2d 513, 517 (CA7 1990), cert.denied, 498 U. S. 1041 (1991). And the Federal Governmentcan criminalize only those threats of violence that are directed against the President, see 18 U. S. C. $ 871--since thereasons why threats of violence are outside the First Amendment (protecting individuals from the fear of violence, fromthe disruption that fear engenders, and from the possibilitythat the threatened violence will occur) have special forcewhen applied to the person of the President. See Watts v.United States, 394 U. S. 705, 707 (1969) (upholding the facialvalidity of $ 871 because of the "overwhelmin[g] interest inprotecting the safety of [the] Chief Executive and in allowinghim to perform his duties without interference from threatsof physical violence"). But the Federal Government maynot criminalize only those threats against the President thatmention his policy on aid to inner cities. And to take a finalexample (one mentioned by Justice Stevens, post, at 421-422), a State may choose to regulate price advertising in oneindustry but not in others, because the risk of fraud (one ofthe characteristics of commercial speech that justifies depriving it of full First Amendment protection, see Virginia505US2105I 07-09-96 19:34:58 PAGES OPINPGT389Cite as: 505 U. S. 377 (1992)Opinion of the CourtState Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Ci tizens ConsumerCouncil, Inc., 425 U. S. 748, 771-772 (1976)) is in its viewgreater there. Cf. Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc.,504 U. S. 374 (1992) (state regulation of airline advertising);Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Assn., 436 U. S. 447 (1978) (stateregulation of lawyer advertising). But a State may not pro-hibit only that commercial advertising that depicts men in ademeaning fashion. See, e. g., Los Angeles Times, Aug. 8,1989, section 4, p. 6, col. 1.Another valid basis for according differential treatmentto even a content-defined subclass of proscribable speech isthat the subclass happens to be associated with particular"secondary effects" of the speech, so that the regulation is"justified without reference to the content of the . . . speech,"Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U. S. 41, 48 (1986)(quoting, with emphasis, Virginia State Bd. of Pharmacy,supra, at 771); see also Young v. American Mini Theatres,Inc., 427 U. S. 50, 71, n. 34 (1976) (plurality opinion); id.,at 80-82 (Powell, J., concurring); Barnes, 501 U. S., at 586(Souter, J., concurring in judgment). A State could, for example, permit all obscene live performances except those involving minors. Moreover, since words can in some circumstances violate laws directed not against speech but againstconduct (a law against treason, for example, is violated bytelling the enemy the Nation's defense secrets), a particularcontent-based subcategory of a proscribable class of speechcan be swept up incidentally within the reach of a statutedirected at conduct rather than speech. See id., at 571 (plurality opinion); id., at 577 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment); id., at 582 (Souter, J., concurring in judgment); FTCv. Superior Court Trial Lawyers Assn., 493 U. S. 411, 425-432 (1990); O'Brien, 391 U. S., at 376-377. Thus, for example, sexually derogatory "fighting words," among otherwords, may produce a violation of Title VII's general prohibition against sexual discrimination in employment practices,42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-2; 29 CFR $ 1604.11 (1991). See also 18505US2105I 07-09-96 19:34:58 PAGES OPINPGT390 R. A. V. v. ST. PAULOpinion of the CourtU. S. C. $ 242; 42 U. S. C. $$ 1981, 1982. Where the govern-ment does not target conduct on the basis of its expressivecontent, acts are not shielded from regulation merely be-cause they express a discriminatory idea or philosophy.These bases for distinction refute the proposition that theselectivity of the restriction is "even arguably `conditionedupon the sovereign's agreement with what a speaker mayintend to say.' "Metromedia, Inc. v. San Diego, 453 U. S.490, 555 (1981) (Stevens, J., dissenting in part) (citationomitted). There may be other such bases as well. Indeed,to validate such selectivity (where totally proscribablespeech is at issue) it may not even be necessary to identifyany particular "neutral" basis, so long as the nature of thecontent discrimination is such that there is no realistic possibility that official suppression of ideas is afoot. (We cannotthink of any First Amendment interest that would stand inthe way of a State's prohibiting only those obscene motionpictures with blue-eyed actresses.) Save for that limitation,the regulation of "fighting words," like the regulation ofnoisy speech, may address some offensive instances andleave other, equally offensive, instances alone. See Posadasde Puerto Rico, 478 U. S., at 342-343.66 Justice Stevens cites a string of opinions as supporting his assertionthat "selective regulation of speech based on content" is not presumptivelyinvalid. Post, at 421-422. Analysis reveals, however, that they do notsupport it. To begin with, three of them did not command a majority ofthe Court, Young v. American Mini Theatres, Inc., 427 U. S. 50, 63-73(1976) (plurality opinion); FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U. S. 726, 744-748 (1978) (plurality opinion); Lehman v. Shaker Heights, 418 U. S. 298(1974) (plurality opinion), and two others did not even discuss the FirstAmendment, Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 504 U. S. 374 (1992);Jacob Siegel Co. v. FTC, 327 U. S. 608 (1946). In any event, all that theircontents establish is what we readily concede: that presumptive invaliditydoes not mean invariable invalidity, leaving room for such exceptions asreasonable and viewpoint-neutral content-based discrimination in nonpublic forums, see Lehman, supra, at 301-304; see also Cornelius v. NAACPLegal Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U. S. 788, 806 (1985), or with respectto certain speech by government employees, see Broadrick v.

Displays containing abusive invective, no matter how vicious or severe,are permissible unless they are addressed to one of the specified disfavored topics. Those who wish to use "fightingwords" in connection with other ideas--to express hostility, for example, on the basis of political affiliation, unionmembership, or homosexuality--are not covered. The FirstAmendment does not permit St. Paul to impose special pro-hibitions on those speakers who express views on disfavoredsubjects. See Simon & Schuster, 502 U. S., at 116; Arkansas Writers' Project, Inc. v. Ragland, 481 U. S. 221, 229-230 (1987).In its practical operation, moreover, the ordinance goeseven beyond mere content discrimination, to actual view-point discrimination. Displays containing some words--odious racial epithets, for example--would be prohibited toproponents of all views. But "fighting words" that do notthemselves invoke race, color, creed, religion, or gender--aspersions upon a person's mother, for example--wouldseemingly be usable ad libitum in the placards of thosearguingin favor of racial, color, etc., tolerance and equality,but could not be used by those speakers' opponents. Onecould hold up a sign saying, for example, that all "anti413 U. S. 601 (1973); see also Civil Service Comm'n v. Letter Carriers, 413U.

PAULOpinion of the CourtCatholic bigots" are misbegotten; but not that all "papists"are, for that would insult and provoke violence "on the basisof religion." St. Paul has no such authority to license oneside of a debate to fight freestyle, while requiring the otherto follow Marquis of Queensberry rules.What we have here, it must be emphasized, is not a prohi-bition of fighting words that are directed at certain personsor groups (which would be facially valid if it met the re-quirements of the Equal Protection Clause); but rather, aprohibition of fighting words that contain (as the MinnesotaSupreme Court repeatedly emphasized) messages of "biasmotivated" hatred and in particular, as applied to this case,messages "based on virulent notions of racial supremacy."464 N. W. 2d, at 508, 511. One must wholeheartedly agreewith the Minnesota Supreme Court that "[i]t is the responsibility, even the obligation, of diverse communities to confrontsuch notions in whatever form they appear," id., at 508, butthe manner of that confrontation cannot consist of selectivelimitations upon speech. St. Paul's brief asserts that a general "fighting words" law would not meet the city's needsbecause only a content-specific measure can communicateto minority groups that the "group hatred" aspect of suchspeech "is not condoned by the majority." Brief for Respondent 25. The point of the First Amendment is that majority preferences must be expressed in some fashion otherthan silencing speech on the basis of its content.Despite the fact that the Minnesota Supreme Court andSt. Paul acknowledge that the ordinance is directed at expression of group hatred, Justice Stevens suggests thatthis "fundamentally misreads" the ordinance. Post, at 433.It is directed, he claims, not to speech of a particular content,but to particular "injur[ies]" that are "qualitatively different" from other injuries. Post, at 424. This is wordplay.What makes the anger, fear, sense of dishonor, etc., producedby violation of this ordinance distinct from the anger, fear,sense of dishonor, etc., produced by other fighting words is505US2105I 07-09-96 19:34:58 PAGES OPINPGT393Cite as: 505 U. S. 377 (1992)Opinion of the Courtnothing other than the fact that it is caused by a distinctiveidea, conveyed by a distinctive message. The First Amendment cannot be evaded that easily. It is obvious that thesymbols which will arouse "anger, alarm or resentment inothers on the basis of race, color, creed, religion or gender"are those symbols that communicate a message of hostilitybased on one of these characteristics. St. Paul concedes inits brief that the ordinance applies only to "racial, religious,or gender-specific symbols" such as "a burning cross, Naziswastika or other instrumentality of like import." Brieffor Respondent 8. Indeed, St. Paul argued in the JuvenileCourt that "[t]he burning of a cross does express a messageand it is, in fact, the content of that message which the St.Paul Ordinance attempts to legislate." Memorandum fromthe Ramsey County Attorney to the Honorable Charles A.Flinn, Jr., dated July 13, 1990, in In re Welfare of R. A. V.,No. 89-D-1231 (Ramsey Cty. Juvenile Ct.), p. 1, reprinted inApp. to Brief for Petitioner C-1.The content-based discrimination reflected in the St. Paulordinance comes within neither any of the specific exceptionsto the First Amendment prohibition we discussed earlier nora more general exception for content discrimination thatdoes not threaten censorship of ideas. It assuredly does notfall within the exception for content discrimination based onthe very reasons why the particular class of speech at issue(here, fighting words) is proscribable. As explained earlier,see supra, at 386, the reason why fighting words are categorically excluded from the protection of the First Amendmentis not that their content communicates any particular idea,but that their content embodies a particularly intolerable(and socially unnecessary) mode of expressing whatever ideathe speaker wishes to convey. St. Paul has not singled outan especially offensive mode of expression--it has not, forexample, selected for prohibition only those fighting wordsthat communicate ideas in a threatening (as opposed to amerely obnoxious) manner. Rather, it has proscribed fight505US2105I 07-09-96 19:34:58 PAGES OPINPGT394 R. A. V. v. ST. PAULOpinion of the Courting words of whatever manner that communicate messagesof racial, gender, or religious intolerance. Selectivity of thissort creates the possibility that the city is seeking to handi-cap the expression of particular ideas. That possibilitywould alone be enough to render the ordinance presump-tively invalid, but St. Paul's comments and concessions inthis case elevate the possibility to a certainty.St. Paul argues that the ordinance comes within anotherof the specific exceptions we mentioned, the one that allowscontent discrimination aimed only at the "secondary effects"of the speech, see Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475U. S. 41 (1986). According to St. Paul, the ordinance is intended, "not to impact on [sic] the right of free expressionof the accused," but rather to "protect against the victimization of a person or persons who are particularly vulner-able because of their membership in a group that historicallyhas been discriminated against." Brief for Respondent 28.Even assuming that an ordinance that completely proscribes,rather than merely regulates, a specified category of speechcan ever be considered to be directed only to the secondaryeffects of such speech, it is clear that the St. Paul ordinanceis not directed to secondary effects within the meaning ofRenton. As we said in Boos v. Barry, 485 U. S. 312 (1988),"Listeners' reactions to speech are not the type of `secondaryeffects' we referred to in Renton." Id., at 321. "The emo-tive impact of speech on its audience is not a `secondary effect.' " Ibid. See also id., at 334 (opinion of Brennan, J.).77 St. Paul has not argued in this case that the ordinance merely regulatesthat subclass of fighting words which is most likely to provoke a violentresponse. But even if one assumes (as appears unlikely) that the categories selected may be so described, that would not justify selective regulation under a "secondary effects" theory. The only reason why such expressive conduct would be especially correlated with violence is that itconveys a particularly odious message; because the "chain of causation"thus necessarily "run[s] through the persuasive effect of the expressivecomponent" of the conduct, Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U. S. 560, 586(1991) (Souter, J., concurring in judgment), it is clear that the St. Paul505US2105I 07-09-96 19:34:58 PAGES OPINPGT395Cite as: 505 U. S. 377 (1992)Opinion of the CourtIt hardly needs discussion that the ordinance does not fallwithin some more general exception permitting all selectivity that for any reason is beyond the suspicion of official sup-pression of ideas. The statements of St. Paul in this verycase afford ample basis for, if not full confirmation of, thatsuspicion.Finally, St. Paul and its amici defend the conclusion ofthe Minnesota Supreme Court that, even if the ordinanceregulates expression based on hostility towards its protectedideological content, this discrimination is nonetheless justified because it is narrowly tailored to serve compelling stateinterests. Specifically, they assert that the ordinance helpsto ensure the basic human rights of members of groups thathave historically been subjected to discrimination, includingthe right of such group members to live in peace where theywish. We do not doubt that these interests are compelling,and that the ordinance can be said to promote them. Butthe "danger of censorship" presented by a facially contentbased statute, Leathers v. Medlock, 499 U. S., at 448, requiresthat that weapon be employed only where it is "necessary toserve the asserted [compelling] interest," Burson v. Freeman, 504 U. S. 191, 199 (1992) (plurality opinion) (emphasisadded); Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators' Assn.,460 U. S. 37, 45 (1983). The existence of adequate content-neutral alternatives thus "undercut[s] significantly" any defense of such a statute, Boos v. Barry, supra, at 329, castingconsiderable doubt on the government's protestations that"the asserted justification is in fact an accurate descriptionof the purpose and effect of the law,"Burson, supra, at 213(Kennedy, J., concurring). See Boos, supra, at 324-329;cf.Minneapolis Star & Tribune Co. v. Minnesota Comm'rof Revenue, 460 U. S. 575, 586-587 (1983). The dispositivequestion in this case, therefore, is whether content discrimi-nation is reasonably necessary to achieve St. Paul's compelordinance regulates on the basis of the "primary" effect of the speech--i. e., its persuasive (or repellant) force.505US2105I 07-09-96 19:34:58 PAGES OPINPGT396 R. A. V. v. ST. PAULOpinion of the Courtling interests; it plainly is not. An ordinance not limitedto the favored topics, for example, would have preciselythe same beneficial effect. In fact the only interest distinctively served by the content limitation is that of displayingthe city council's special hostility towards the particularbiases thus singled out.8 That is precisely what the FirstAmendment forbids. The politicians of St. Paul are entitledto express that hostility--but not through the means ofimposing unique limitations upon speakers who (howeverbenightedly) disagree.* * *Let there be no mistake about our belief that burning across in someone's front yard is reprehensible. But St. Paulhas sufficient means at its disposal to prevent such behaviorwithout adding the First Amendment to the fire.The judgment of the Minnesota Supreme Court is reversed, and the case is remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
