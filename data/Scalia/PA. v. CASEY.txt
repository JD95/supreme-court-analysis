SOUTH CAROLINA COASTAL COUNCILOpinion of the Court$ 48-39-10(J)) to obtain a permit from the newly createdSouth Carolina Coastal Council (Council) (respondent here)prior to committing the land to a "use other than the use thecritical area was devoted to on [September 28, 1977]."$ 48-39-130(A).In the late 1970's, Lucas and others began extensive residential development of the Isle of Palms, a barrier islandsituated eastward of the city of Charleston. Toward theclose of the development cycle for one residential subdivisionknown as "Beachwood East," Lucas in 1986 purchased thetwo lots at issue in this litigation for his own account. Noportion of the lots, which were located approximately 300feet from the beach, qualified as a "critical area" under the1977 Act; accordingly, at the time Lucas acquired these parcels, he was not legally obliged to obtain a permit from theCouncil in advance of any development activity. His intention with respect to the lots was to do what the owners of theimmediately adjacent parcels had already done: erect singlefamily residences. He commissioned architectural drawingsfor this purpose.The Beachfront Management Act brought Lucas's plans toan abrupt end. Under that 1988 legislation, the Council wasdirected to establish a "baseline" connecting the landward-most "point[s] of erosion . . . during the past forty years" inthe region of the Isle of Palms that includes Lucas's lots.S. C. Code Ann. $ 48-39-280(A)(2) (Supp. 1988).1 In actionnot challenged here, the Council fixed this baseline landwardof Lucas's parcels. That was significant, for under the Act1 This specialized historical method of determining the baseline appliedbecause the Beachwood East subdivision is located adjacent to a so-called"inlet erosion zone" (defined in the Act to mean "a segment of shorelinealong or adjacent to tidal inlets which are directly influenced by the inletand its associated shoals," S. C. Code Ann. $ 48-39-270(7) (Supp. 1988))that is "not stabilized by jetties, terminal groins, or other structures,"$ 48-39-280(A)(2). For areas other than these unstabilized inlet erosionzones, the statute directs that the baseline be established along "the crestof an ideal primary oceanfront sand dune." $ 48-39-280(A)(1).505us3118M 06-19-96 18:08:20 PAGES OPINPGT1009Cite as: 505 U.

The Act provided noexceptions.BLucas promptly filed suit in the South Carolina Court ofCommon Pleas, contending that the Beachfront ManagementAct's construction bar effected a taking of his property with-out just compensation. Lucas did not take issue with thevalidity of the Act as a lawful exercise of South Carolina'spolice power, but contended that the Act's complete extinguishment of his property's value entitled him to compensa-tion regardless of whether the legislature had acted in furtherance of legitimate police power objectives. Following abench trial, the court agreed. Among its factual determinations was the finding that "at the time Lucas purchased thetwo lots, both were zoned for single-family residential construction and . . . there were no restrictions imposed uponsuch use of the property by either the State of South Carolina, the County of Charleston, or the Town of the Isle ofPalms." App. to Pet. for Cert. 36. The trial court furtherfound that the Beachfront Management Act decreed a per-manent ban on construction insofar as Lucas's lots wereconcerned, and that this prohibition "deprive[d] Lucas ofany reasonable economic use of the lots, . . . eliminated theunrestricted right of use, and render[ed] them valueless."Id., at 37. The court thus concluded that Lucas's propertieshad been "taken" by operation of the Act, and it orderedrespondent to pay "just compensation" in the amount of$1,232,387.50. Id., at 40.The Supreme Court of South Carolina reversed. It founddispositive what it described as Lucas's concession "that the2 The Act did allow the construction of certain nonhabitable improvements, e. g., "wooden walkways no larger in width than six feet," and"small wooden decks no larger than one hundred forty-four square feet."$$ 48-39-290(A)(1) and (2).505us3118M 06-19-96 18:08:20 PAGES OPINPGT1010 LUCAS v.

E. 2d 895, 896 (1991). Failing an attack onthe validity of the statute as such, the court believed itselfbound to accept the "uncontested . . . findings" of the SouthCarolina Legislature that new construction in the coastalzone--such as petitioner intended--threatened this publicresource.Id., at 383, 404 S. E. 2d, at 898. The court ruledthat when a regulation respecting the use of property isdesigned "to prevent serious public harm," id., at 383, 404S. E. 2d, at 899 (citing, inter alia, Mugler v. Kansas, 123U. S. 623 (1887)), no compensation is owing under the Tak-ings Clause regardless of the regulation's effect on the property's value.Two justices dissented. They acknowledged that ourMugler line of cases recognizes governmental power to pro-hibit "noxious" uses of property--i. e., uses of property akinto "public nuisances"--without having to pay compensation.But they would not have characterized the Beachfront Man-agement Act's "primary purpose [as] the prevention of a nui-sance." 304 S. C., at 395, 404 S. E. 2d, at 906 (Harwell, J.,dissenting).

Id., at 396, 404S. E. 2d, at 906. As a consequence, they would have af-firmed the trial court's conclusion that the Act's obliterationof the value of petitioner's lots accomplished a taking.We granted certiorari. 502 U. S. 966 (1991).IIAs a threshold matter, we must briefly address the Coun-cil's suggestion that this case is inappropriate for plenaryreview. After briefing and argument before the South Car-olina Supreme Court, but prior to issuance of that court'sopinion, the Beachfront Management Act was amended to505us3118M 06-19-96 18:08:20 PAGES OPINPGT1011Cite as: 505 U.

See S. C.Code Ann. $ 48-39-290(D)(1) (Supp. 1991). According to theCouncil, this amendment renders Lucas's claim of a permanent deprivation unripe, as Lucas may yet be able to securepermission to build on his property. "[The Court's] cases,"we are reminded, "uniformly reflect an insistence on knowingthe nature and extent of permitted development before adjudicating the constitutionality of the regulations that purportto limit it."MacDonald, Sommer & Frates v. Yolo County,477 U. S. 340, 351 (1986). See also Agins v. City of Tiburon,447 U. S. 255, 260 (1980). Because petitioner "has not yetobtained a final decision regarding how [he] will be allowedto develop [his] property," Williamson County RegionalPlanning Comm'n v. Hamilton Bank of Johnson City, 473U. S. 172, 190 (1985), the Council argues that he is not yetentitled to definitive adjudication of his takings claim inthis Court.We think these considerations would preclude review hadthe South Carolina Supreme Court rested its judgment onripeness grounds, as it was (essentially) invited to do by theCouncil. See Brief for Respondent 9, n. 3. The South Carolina Supreme Court shrugged off the possibility of furtheradministrative and trial proceedings, however, preferring todispose of Lucas's takings claim on the merits. Cf., e. g., SanDiego Gas & Electric Co. v. San Diego, 450 U. S. 621, 631-632(1981). This unusual disposition does not preclude Lucasfrom applying for a permit under the 1990 amendment forfuture construction, and challenging, on takings grounds,any denial. But it does preclude, both practically and legally, any takings claim with respect to Lucas's past deprivation, i. e., for his having been denied construction rights during the period before the 1990 amendment. See generallyFirst English Evangelical Lutheran Church of Glendale v.County of Los Angeles, 482 U. S. 304 (1987) (holding that505us3118M 06-19-96 18:08:20 PAGES OPINPGT1012 LUCAS v. SOUTH CAROLINA COASTAL COUNCILOpinion of the Courttemporary deprivations of use are compensable under theTakings Clause). Without even so much as commentingupon the consequences of the South Carolina SupremeCourt's judgment in this respect, the Council insists that permitting Lucas to press his claim of a past deprivation on thisappeal would be improper, since "the issues of whether andto what extent [Lucas] has incurred a temporary taking . . .have simply never been addressed." Brief for Respondent11. Yet Lucas had no reason to proceed on a "temporarytaking" theory at trial, or even to seek remand for that pur-pose prior to submission of the case to the South CarolinaSupreme Court, since as the Act then read, the taking wasunconditional and permanent. Moreover, given the breadthof the South Carolina Supreme Court's holding and judgment, Lucas would plainly be unable (absent our interventionnow) to obtain further state-court adjudication with respectto the 1988-1990 period.In these circumstances, we think it would not accord withsound process to insist that Lucas pursue the late-created"special permit" procedure before his takings claim can beconsidered ripe. Lucas has properly alleged Article III injury in fact in this case, with respect to both the pre-1990and post-1990 constraints placed on the use of his parcels bythe Beachfront Management Act.3 That there is a discre3 Justice Blackmun insists that this aspect of Lucas's claim is "notjusticiable," post, at 1042, because Lucas never fulfilled his obligationunder Williamson County Regional Planning Comm'n v.

But such a submission would have been pointless, as theCouncil stipulated below that no building permit would have been issuedunder the 1988 Act, application or no application.

See Esposito v. SouthCarolina Coastal Council, 939 F. 2d 165, 168 (CA4 1991),cert. denied, post, p. 1219.4 We leave for decision on remand, of course, the questions left unaddressed by the Southto address that component as if the case were here on the pleadings alone.Lucas properly alleged injury in fact in his complaint. See App. to Pet.for Cert. 154 (complaint); id., at 156 (asking "damages for the temporarytaking of his property" from the date of the 1988 Act's passage to "suchtime as this matter is finally resolved"). No more can reasonably be demanded. Cf. First English Evangelical Lutheran Church of Glendale v.County of Los Angeles, 482 U. S. 304, 312-313 (1987). Justice Blackmun finds it "baffling," post, at 1043, n. 5, that we grant standing here,whereas "just a few days ago, in Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S.555 (1992)," we denied standing. He sees in that strong evidence to support his repeated imputations that the Court "presses" to take this case,post, at 1036, is "eager to decide" it, post, at 1045, and is unwilling to "bedenied," post, at 1042. He has a point: The decisions are indeed very closein time, yet one grants standing and the other denies it. The distinction,however, rests in law rather than chronology. Lujan, since it involvedthe establishment of injury in fact at the summary judgment stage, required specific facts to be adduced by sworn testimony; had the same challenge to a generalized allegation of injury in fact been made at the pleading stage, it would have been unsuccessful.4 In that case, the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reached themerits of a takings challenge to the 1988 Beachfront Management Actidentical to the one Lucas brings here even though the Act was amended,and the special permit procedure established, while the case was undersubmission. The court observed:"The enactment of the 1990 Act during the pendency of this appeal, withits provisions for special permits and other changes that may affect theplaintiffs, does not relieve us of the need to address the plaintiffs' claimsunder the provisions of the 1988 Act. Even if the amended Act cured allof the plaintiffs' concerns, the amendments would not foreclose the possibility that a taking had occurred during the years when the 1988 Act wasin effect." Esposito v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 939 F. 2d 165,168 (1991).505us3118M 06-19-96 18:08:21 PAGES OPINPGT1014 LUCAS v. SOUTH CAROLINA COASTAL COUNCILOpinion of the CourtCarolina Supreme Court as a consequence of its categoricaldisposition.5IIIAPrior to Justice Holmes's exposition in Pennsylvania CoalCo. v. Mahon, 260 U. S. 393 (1922), it was generally thoughtthat the Takings Clause reached only a "direct appropria-tion" of property, Legal Tender Cases, 12 Wall. 457, 551(1871), or the functional equivalent of a "practical ouster of[the owner's] possession,"Transportation Co. v. Chicago, 99U. S. 635, 642 (1879). See also Gibson v. United States, 166U. S. 269, 275-276 (1897). Justice Holmes recognized inMahon, however, that if the protection against physicalappropriations of private property was to be meaningfullyenforced, the government's power to redefine the range ofinterests included in the ownership of property was neces-sarily constrained by constitutional limits. 260 U. S., at414-415. If, instead, the uses of private property were sub-ject to unbridled, uncompensated qualification under the police power, "the natural tendency of human nature [wouldbe] to extend the qualification more and more until at lastprivate property disappear[ed]." Id., at 415. These consid-erations gave birth in that case to the oft-cited maxim that,"while property may be regulated to a certain extent, if reg-ulation goes too far it will be recognized as a taking." Ibid.5 Justice Blackmun states that our "intense interest in Lucas' plight. . . would have been more prudently expressed by vacating the judgmentbelow and remanding for further consideration in light of the 1990 amendments" to the Beachfront Management Act. Post, at 1045, n. 7. That isa strange suggestion, given that the South Carolina Supreme Court rendered its categorical disposition in this case after the Act had beenamended, and after it had been invited to consider the effect of thoseamendments on Lucas's case. We have no reason to believe that the justices of the South Carolina Supreme Court are any more desirous of usinga narrower ground now than they were then; and neither "prudence" norany other principle of judicial restraint requires that we remand to findout whether they have changed their mind.505us3118M 06-19-96 18:08:21 PAGES OPINPGT1015Cite as: 505 U. S. 1003 (1992)Opinion of the CourtNevertheless, our decision in Mahon offered little insightinto when, and under what circumstances, a given regulationwould be seen as going "too far" for purposes of the FifthAmendment. In 70-odd years of succeeding "regulatorytakings" jurisprudence, we have generally eschewed any" `set formula' " for determining how far is too far, preferringto "engag[e] in . . . essentially ad hoc, factual inquiries."Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City, 438 U. S.104, 124 (1978) (quotingGoldblatt v. Hempstead, 369 U. S.590, 594 (1962)). See Epstein, Takings: Descent and Resur-rection, 1987 S. Ct. Rev. 1, 4. We have, however, describedat least two discrete categories of regulatory action as compensable without case-specific inquiry into the public interestadvanced in support of the restraint. The first encompassesregulations that compel the property owner to suffer a physical "invasion" of his property. In general (at least with regard to permanent invasions), no matter how minute the intrusion, and no matter how weighty the public purposebehind it, we have required compensation. For example, inLoretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U. S.419 (1982), we determined that New York's law requiringlandlords to allow television cable companies to emplacecable facilities in their apartment buildings constituted a taking, id., at 435-440, even though the facilities occupied atmost only 11/2 cubic feet of the landlords' property, see id., at438, n. 16. See also United States v. Causby, 328 U. S. 256,265, and n. 10 (1946) (physical invasions of airspace); cf. Kaiser Aetna v. United States, 444 U. S. 164 (1979) (impositionof navigational servitude upon private marina).The second situation in which we have found categoricaltreatment appropriate is where regulation denies all economically beneficial or productive use of land. See Agins,447 U. S., at 260; see also Nollan v. California CoastalComm'n, 483 U. S. 825, 834 (1987); Keystone BituminousCoal Assn. v. DeBenedictis, 480 U. S. 470, 495 (1987); Hodelv.

S. 264, 295-296 (1981).6 As we have said on numerousoccasions, the Fifth Amendment is violated when land-useregulation "does not substantially advance legitimate stateinterests or denies an owner economically viable use of hisland." Agins, supra, at 260 (citations omitted) (emphasisadded).76 We will not attempt to respond to all of Justice Blackmun's mistakencitation of case precedent. Characteristic of its nature is his assertionthat the cases we discuss here stand merely for the proposition "that proofthat a regulation does not deny an owner economic use of his property issufficient to defeat a facial takings challenge" and not for the point that"denial of such use is sufficient to establish a takings claim regardless ofany other consideration." Post, at 1050, n. 11. The cases say, repeatedlyand unmistakably, that " `[t]he test to be applied in considering [a] facial[takings] challenge is fairly straightforward. A statute regulating theuses that can be made of property effects a taking if it "denies an ownereconomically viable use of his land." ' " Keystone, 480 U. S., at 495 (quoting Hodel, 452 U. S., at 295-296 (quoting Agins, 447 U. S., at 260)) (emphasis added).Justice Blackmun describes that rule (which we do not invent butmerely apply today) as "alter[ing] the long-settled rules of review" byfoisting on the State "the burden of showing [its] regulation is not ataking." Post, at 1045, 1046. This is of course wrong. Lucas had to domore than simply file a lawsuit to establish his constitutional entitlement;he had to show that the Beachfront Management Act denied him economically beneficial use of his land. Our analysis presumes the unconstitutionality of state land-use regulation only in the sense that any rule withexceptions presumes the invalidity of a law that violates it--for example,the rule generally prohibiting content-based restrictions on speech. See,e. g., Simon & Schuster, Inc. v. Members of N. Y. State Crime Victims Bd.,502 U. S. 105, 115 (1991) ("A statute is presumptively inconsistent with theFirst Amendment if it imposes a financial burden on speakers because ofthe content of their speech"). Justice Blackmun's real quarrel is withthe substantive standard of liability we apply in this case, a longestablished standard we see no need to repudiate.7 Regrettably, the rhetorical force of our "deprivation of all economicallyfeasible use" rule is greater than its precision, since the rule does notmake clear the "property interest" against which the loss of value is to bemeasured. When, for example, a regulation requires a developer to leave90% of a rural tract in its natural state, it is unclear whether we would505us3118M 06-19-96 18:08:21 PAGES OPINPGT1017Cite as: 505 U. S. 1003 (1992)Opinion of the CourtWe have never set forth the justification for this rule. Perhaps it is simply, as Justice Brennan suggested, that totaldeprivation of beneficial use is, from the landowner's pointof view, the equivalent of a physical appropriation. See SanDiego Gas & Electric Co. v. San Diego, 450 U. S., at 652(dissenting opinion). "[F]or what is the land but the profitsthereof[?]" 1 E. Coke, Institutes, ch. 1, $ 1 (1st Am. ed.1812). Surely, at least, in the extraordinary circumstancewhen no productive or economically beneficial use of land ispermitted, it is less realistic to indulge our usual assumptionthat the legislature is simply "adjusting the benefits and burdens of economic life," Penn Central Transportation Co., 438analyze the situation as one in which the owner has been deprived of alleconomically beneficial use of the burdened portion of the tract, or as onein which the owner has suffered a mere diminution in value of the tractas a whole. (For an extreme--and, we think, unsupportable--view of therelevant calculus, see Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City,42 N. Y. 2d 324, 333-334, 366 N. E. 2d 1271, 1276-1277 (1977), aff'd, 438U. S. 104 (1978), where the state court examined the diminution in a particular parcel's value produced by a municipal ordinance in light of total valueof the takings claimant's other holdings in the vicinity.) Unsurprisingly,this uncertainty regarding the composition of the denominator in our "deprivation" fraction has produced inconsistent pronouncements by the Court.Compare Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U. S. 393, 414 (1922) (lawrestricting subsurface extraction of coal held to effect a taking), with Keystone Bituminous Coal Assn. v. DeBenedictis, 480 U. S. 470, 497-502(1987) (nearly identical law held not to effect a taking); see also id., at515-520 (Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting); Rose, Mahon Reconstructed: Whythe Takings Issue is Still a Muddle, 57 S. Cal. L. Rev. 561, 566-569 (1984).The answer to this difficult question may lie in how the owner's reasonableexpectations have been shaped by the State's law of property--i. e.,whether and to what degree the State's law has accorded legal recognitionand protection to the particular interest in land with respect to which thetakings claimant alleges a diminution in (or elimination of) value. In anyevent, we avoid this difficulty in the present case, since the "interest inland" that Lucas has pleaded (a fee simple interest) is an estate with arich tradition of protection at common law, and since the South CarolinaCourt of Common Pleas found that the Beachfront Management Act lefteach of Lucas's beachfront lots without economic value.505us3118M 06-19-96 18:08:21 PAGES OPINPGT1018 LUCAS v. SOUTH CAROLINA COASTAL COUNCILOpinion of the CourtU. S., at 124, in a manner that secures an "average reciprocity of advantage" to everyone concerned, Pennsylvania CoalCo. v. Mahon, 260 U. S., at 415. And the functional basis forpermitting the government, by regulation, to affect propertyvalues without compensation--that "Government hardlycould go on if to some extent values incident to propertycould not be diminished without paying for every suchchange in the general law," id., at 413--does not apply to therelatively rare situations where the government has deprived a landowner of all economically beneficial uses.On the other side of the balance, affirmatively supportinga compensation requirement, is the fact that regulations thatleave the owner of land without economically beneficial orproductive options for its use--typically, as here, by requiring land to be left substantially in its natural state--carrywith them a heightened risk that private property is beingpressed into some form of public service under the guiseof mitigating serious public harm. See, e. g., Annicelli v.South Kingstown, 463 A. 2d 133, 140-141 (R. I. 1983) (prohibition on construction adjacent to beach justified on twingrounds of safety and "conservation of open space"); MorrisCounty Land Improvement Co. v. Parsippany-Troy HillsTownship, 40 N.

As Justice Brennan explained: "From the government's point of view, the benefits flowing to the publicfrom preservation of open space through regulation maybe equally great as from creating a wildlife refuge throughformal condemnation or increasing electricity productionthrough a dam project that floods private property."

This analysis errs in its assumption that the landownerwhose deprivation is one step short of complete is not entitled to compensation. Such an owner might not be able to claim the benefit of our categorical formulation, but, as we have acknowledged time and again, "[t]heeconomic impact of the regulation on the claimant and . . . the extentto which the regulation has interfered with distinct investment-backedexpectations" are keenly relevant to takings analysis generally. Penn505us3118M 06-19-96 18:08:21 PAGES OPINPGT1020 LUCAS v. SOUTH CAROLINA COASTAL COUNCILOpinion of the CourtBThe trial court found Lucas's two beachfront lots to havebeen rendered valueless by respondent's enforcement of thecoastal-zone construction ban.9 Under Lucas's theory of thecase, which rested upon our "no economically viable use"statements, that finding entitled him to compensation.Lucas believed it unnecessary to take issue with either thepurposes behind the Beachfront Management Act, or themeans chosen by the South Carolina Legislature to effectuate those purposes. The South Carolina Supreme Court,however, thought otherwise. In its view, the BeachfrontManagement Act was no ordinary enactment, but involvedan exercise of South Carolina's "police powers" to mitigatethe harm to the public interest that petitioner's use of hisCentral Transportation Co. v. New York City, 438 U. S. 104, 124 (1978).It is true that in at least some cases the landowner with 95% loss will getnothing, while the landowner with total loss will recover in full. But thatoccasional result is no more strange than the gross disparity between thelandowner whose premises are taken for a highway (who recovers in full)and the landowner whose property is reduced to 5% of its former valueby the highway (who recovers nothing). Takings law is full of these "allor-nothing" situations.Justice Stevens similarly misinterprets our focus on "developmental"uses of property (the uses proscribed by the Beachfront Management Act)as betraying an "assumption that the only uses of property cognizableunder the Constitution are developmental uses." Post, at 1065, n. 3. Wemake no such assumption. Though our prior takings cases evince an abiding concern for the productive use of, and economic investment in, land,there are plainly a number of noneconomic interests in land whose impairment will invite exceedingly close scrutiny under the Takings Clause.See, e. g., Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U. S. 419,436 (1982) (interest in excluding strangers from one's land).9 This finding was the premise of the petition for certiorari, and since itwas not challenged in the brief in opposition we decline to entertain theargument in respondent's brief on the merits, see Brief for Respondent45-50, that the finding was erroneous. Instead, we decide the questionpresented under the same factual assumptions as did the Supreme Courtof South Carolina. See Oklahoma City v. Tuttle, 471 U.

The tourists who come to the South Carolina coast to enjoy the ocean and dry sandbeach contribute significantly to state and local tax revenues;"(c) provides habitat for numerous species of plants and animals, severalof which are threatened or endangered. Waters adjacent to the beach/dune system also provide habitat for many other marine species;"(d) provides a natural health environment for the citizens of South Carolina to spend leisure time which serves their physical and mental wellbeing."(2) Beach/dune system vegetation is unique and extremely importantto the vitality and preservation of the system."(3) Many miles of South Carolina's beaches have been identified as critically eroding."(4) . . .

It is in both the public and private interests to protect thesystem from this unwise development."(5) The use of armoring in the form of hard erosion control devicessuch as seawalls, bulkheads, and rip-rap to protect erosion-threatenedstructures adjacent to the beach has not proven effective. These armoring devices have given a false sense of security to beachfront propertyowners. In reality, these hard structures, in many instances, have increased the vulnerability of beachfront property to damage from wind andwaves while contributing to the deterioration and loss of the dry sandbeach which is so important to the tourism industry."(6) Erosion is a natural process which becomes a significant problemfor man only when structures are erected in close proximity to the beach/505us3118M 06-19-96 18:08:21 PAGES OPINPGT1022 LUCAS v.

Id., at 382-383, 404 S. E. 2d, at 898. In the court'sview, these concessions brought petitioner's challenge withina long line of this Court's cases sustaining against Due Proc-ess and Takings Clause challenges the State's use of its "police powers" to enjoin a property owner from activities akinto public nuisances. SeeMugler v. Kansas, 123 U. S. 623(1887) (law prohibiting manufacture of alcoholic beverages);Hadacheck v. Sebastian, 239 U.

S. 590 (1962) (law effectively preventing continued operation of quarry in residential area).It is correct that many of our prior opinions have suggested that "harmful or noxious uses" of property may beproscribed by government regulation without the requirement of compensation. For a number of reasons, however,we think the South Carolina Supreme Court was too quick toconclude that that principle decides the present case. The"harmful or noxious uses" principle was the Court's earlyattempt to describe in theoretical terms why governmentdune system. It is in both the public and private interests to afford thebeach/dune system space to accrete and erode in its natural cycle.

S. 1003 (1992)Opinion of the Courtmay, consistent with the Takings Clause, affect property val-ues by regulation without incurring an obligation to compensate--a reality we nowadays acknowledge explicitly with re-spect to the full scope of the State's police power. See,e. g.,Penn Central Transportation Co., 438 U. S., at 125 (whereState "reasonably conclude[s] that `the health, safety, morals,or general welfare' would be promoted by prohibitingparticular contemplated uses of land," compensation neednot accompany prohibition); see alsoNollan v. CaliforniaCoastal Comm'n, 483 U. S., at 834-835 ("Our cases have notelaborated on the standards for determining what constitutes a `legitimate state interest[,]' [but] [t]hey have madeclear . . . that a broad range of governmental purposes andregulations satisfy these requirements"). We made thisvery point in Penn Central Transportation Co., where, inthe course of sustaining New York City's landmarks preservation program against a takings challenge, we rejected thepetitioner's suggestion thatMugler and the cases followingit were premised on, and thus limited by, some objective con-ception of "noxiousness":"[T]he uses in issue in Hadacheck, Miller, and Goldblattwere perfectly lawful in themselves. They involved no`blameworthiness, . . . moral wrongdoing or consciousact of dangerous risk-taking which induce[d society] toshift the cost to a pa[rt]icular individual.' Sax, Takingsand the Police Power, 74 Yale L. J. 36, 50 (1964). Thesecases are better understood as resting not on any supposed `noxious' quality of the prohibited uses but ratheron the ground that the restrictions were reasonably related to the implementation of a policy--not unlike historic preservation--expected to produce a widespreadpublic benefit and applicable to all similarly situatedproperty." 438 U. S., at 133-134, n. 30."Harmful or noxious use" analysis was, in other words, simply the progenitor of our more contemporary statements that505us3118M 06-19-96 18:08:21 PAGES OPINPGT1024 LUCAS v. SOUTH CAROLINA COASTAL COUNCILOpinion of the Court"land-use regulation does not effect a taking if it `substan-tially advance[s] legitimate state interests' . . . ." Nollan,supra, at 834 (quoting Agins v. Tiburon, 447 U. S., at 260);see also Penn Central Transportation Co., supra, at 127;Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., 272 U. S. 365, 387-388 (1926).The transition from our early focus on control of "noxious"uses to our contemporary understanding of the broad realmwithin which government may regulate without compensation was an easy one, since the distinction between "harm-preventing" and "benefit-conferring" regulation is often inthe eye of the beholder. It is quite possible, for example, todescribe ineither fashion the ecological, economic, and es-thetic concerns that inspired the South Carolina Legislaturein the present case. One could say that imposing a servi-tude on Lucas's land is necessary in order to prevent his useof it from "harming" South Carolina's ecological resources;or, instead, in order to achieve the "benefits" of an ecological preserve.11 Compare, e. g., Claridge v. New Hampshire11 In the present case, in fact, some of the "[South Carolina] legislature's`findings' " to which the South Carolina Supreme Court purported to deferin characterizing the purpose of the Act as "harm-preventing," 304 S. C.376, 385, 404 S. E. 2d 895, 900 (1991), seem to us phrased in "benefitconferring" language instead. For example, they describe the importanceof a construction ban in enhancing "South Carolina's annual tourism industry revenue," S. C. Code Ann. $ 48-39-250(1)(b) (Supp. 1991), in "provid[ing] habitat for numerous species of plants and animals, several of whichare threatened or endangered," $ 48-39-250(1)(c), and in "provid[ing] anatural healthy environment for the citizens of South Carolina to spendleisure time which serves their physical and mental well-being," $ 48-39-250(1)(d). It would be pointless to make the outcome of this case hangupon this terminology, since the same interests could readily be describedin "harm-preventing" fashion.Justice Blackmun, however, apparently insists that we must makethe outcome hinge (exclusively) upon the South Carolina Legislature'sother, "harm-preventing" characterizations, focusing on the declarationthat "prohibitions on building in front of the setback line are necessary toprotect people and property from storms, high tides, and beach erosion."Post, at 1040.

H. 745, 752, 485 A. 2d 287, 292 (1984)(owner may, without compensation, be barred from fillingwetlands because landfilling would deprive adjacent coastalhabitats and marine fisheries of ecological support), with,e. g., Bartlett v.

Whether one or the other of thecompeting characterizations will come to one's lips in a par-ticular case depends primarily upon one's evaluation of theworth of competing uses of real estate. See Restatement(Second) of Torts $ 822, Commentg, p. 112 (1979) ("Practically all human activities unless carried on in a wildernessinterfere to some extent with others or involve some risk ofinterference"). A given restraint will be seen as mitigating"harm" to the adjacent parcels or securing a "benefit" forthem, depending upon the observer's evaluation of the relative importance of the use that the restraint favors. SeeSax, Takings and the Police Power, 74 Yale L. J. 36, 49 (1964)("[T]he problem [in this area] is not one of noxiousness orharm-creating activity at all; rather it is a problem of inconsistency between perfectly innocent and independentlydesirable uses"). Whether Lucas's construction of single-family residences on his parcels should be described as bringing "harm" to South Carolina's adjacent ecological resourcesthus depends principally upon whether the describer believes that the State's use interest in nurturing those re-sources is so important thatany competing adjacent usemust yield.12if their structures are not "destroyed beyond repair," S. C. Code Ann.$ 48-39-290(B) (Supp. 1988)), and in the fact that the 1990 amendmentauthorizes the Council to issue permits for new construction in violationof the uniform prohibition, see S. C. Code Ann. $ 48-39-290(D)(1) (Supp.1991).12 In Justice Blackmun's view, even with respect to regulations thatdeprive an owner of all developmental or economically beneficial land uses,505us3118M 06-19-96 18:08:21 PAGES OPINPGT1026 LUCAS v. SOUTH CAROLINA COASTAL COUNCILOpinion of the CourtWhen it is understood that "prevention of harmful use"was merely our early formulation of the police power justification necessary to sustain (without compensation) any regu-latory diminution in value; and that the distinction betweenregulation that "prevents harmful use" and that which "con-fers benefits" is difficult, if not impossible, to discern onan objective, value-free basis; it becomes self-evident thatnoxious-use logic cannot serve as a touchstone to distinguishregulatory "takings"--which require compensation--fromregulatory deprivations that do not require compensation.A fortiori the legislature's recitation of a noxious-use justifi-cation cannot be the basis for departing from our categoricalrule that total regulatory takings must be compensated. Ifit were, departure would virtually always be allowed. TheSouth Carolina Supreme Court's approach would essentiallynullify Mahon's affirmation of limits to the noncompensableexercise of the police power. Our cases provide no supportfor this: None of them that employed the logic of "harmfuluse" prevention to sustain a regulation involved an allega-tion that the regulation wholly eliminated the value of theclaimant's land. See Keystone Bituminous Coal Assn., 480U. S., at 513-514 (Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting).13the test for required compensation is whether the legislature has recited aharm-preventing justification for its action. See post, at 1039, 1040-1041,1047-1051. Since such a justification can be formulated in practicallyevery case, this amounts to a test of whether the legislature has a stupidstaff. We think the Takings Clause requires courts to do more than insistupon artful harm-preventing characterizations.13 E. g., Mugler v. Kansas, 123 U. S. 623 (1887) (prohibition upon useof a building as a brewery; other uses permitted); Plymouth Coal Co. v.Pennsylvania, 232 U. S. 531 (1914) (requirement that "pillar" of coal beleft in ground to safeguard mine workers; mineral rights could otherwisebe exploited); Reinman v. Little Rock, 237 U.

S. 1003 (1992)Opinion of the CourtWhere the State seeks to sustain regulation that deprivesland of all economically beneficial use, we think it may resistcompensation only if the logically antecedent inquiry into thenature of the owner's estate shows that the proscribed useinterests were not part of his title to begin with.14 Thisaccords, we think, with our "takings" jurisprudence, whichhas traditionally been guided by the understandings of ourcitizens regarding the content of, and the State's power over,the "bundle of rights" that they acquire when they obtaintitle to property. It seems to us that the property ownernecessarily expects the uses of his property to be restricted,from time to time, by various measures newly enacted bythe State in legitimate exercise of its police powers; "[a]slong recognized, some values are enjoyed under an impliedlimitation and must yield to the police power."Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U. S., at 413. And in the case ofpersonal property, by reason of the State's traditionally highdegree of control over commercial dealings, he ought to beaware of the possibility that new regulation might even ren14 Drawing on our First Amendment jurisprudence, see, e. g., Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith, 494 U. S. 872,878-879 (1990), Justice Stevens would "loo[k] to the generality of aregulation of property" to determine whether compensation is owing.Post, at 1072. The Beachfront Management Act is general, in his view,because it "regulates the use of the coastline of the entire State." Post,at 1074. There may be some validity to the principle Justice Stevensproposes, but it does not properly apply to the present case. The equivalent of a law of general application that inhibits the practice of religionwithout being aimed at religion, see Oregon v. Smith, supra, is a law thatdestroys the value of land without being aimed at land. Perhaps such alaw--the generally applicable criminal prohibition on the manufacturingof alcoholic beverages challenged in Mugler comes to mind--cannot constitute a compensable taking. See 123 U. S., at 655-656. But a regulationspecifically directed to land use no more acquires immunity by plunderinglandowners generally than does a law specifically directed at religiouspractice acquire immunity by prohibiting all religions. Justice Stevens's approach renders the Takings Clause little more than a particularized restatement of the Equal Protection Clause.505us3118M 06-19-96 18:08:21 PAGES OPINPGT1028 LUCAS v.

Allard, 444 U. S. 51, 66-67(1979) (prohibition on sale of eagle feathers). In the case ofland, however, we think the notion pressed by the Councilthat title is somehow held subject to the "implied limitation"that the State may subsequently eliminate all economicallyvaluable use is inconsistent with the historical compact recorded in the Takings Clause that has become part of ourconstitutional culture.15Where "permanent physical occupation" of land is concerned, we have refused to allow the government to decreeit anew (without compensation), no matter how weighty theasserted "public interests" involved, Loretto v. TeleprompterManhattan CATV Corp., 458 U. S., at 426--though we assuredly would permit the government to assert a permanenteasement that was a pre-existing limitation upon the land15 After accusing us of "launch[ing] a missile to kill a mouse," post, at1036, Justice Blackmun expends a good deal of throw-weight of his ownupon a noncombatant, arguing that our description of the "understanding"of land ownership that informs the Takings Clause is not supported byearly American experience. That is largely true, but entirely irrelevant.The practices of the States prior to incorporation of the Takings and JustCompensation Clauses, see Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. Chicago, 166 U. S.226 (1897)--which, as Justice Blackmun acknowledges, occasionally included outright physical appropriation of land without compensation, seepost, at 1056--were out of accord with any plausible interpretation ofthose provisions. Justice Blackmun is correct that early constitutionaltheorists did not believe the Takings Clause embraced regulations of property at all, see post, at 1057-1058, and n. 23, but even he does not suggest(explicitly, at least) that we renounce the Court's contrary conclusion inMahon. Since the text of the Clause can be read to encompass regulatoryas well as physical deprivations (in contrast to the text originally proposedby Madison, see Speech Proposing Bill of Rights (June 8, 1789), in 12J. Madison, The Papers of James Madison 201 (C. Hobson, R. Rutland,W. Rachal, & J. Sisson ed. 1979) ("No person shall be . . . obliged to relinquish his property, where it may be necessary for public use, without ajust compensation"), we decline to do so as well.505us3118M 06-19-96 18:08:21 PAGES OPINPGT1029Cite as: 505 U.

S. 141,163 (1900) (interests of "riparian owner in the submergedlands . . . bordering on a public navigable water" held subjectto Government's navigational servitude), with Kaiser Aetnav. United States, 444 U. S., at 178-180 (imposition of naviga-tional servitude on marina created and rendered navigableat private expense held to constitute a taking). We believesimilar treatment must be accorded confiscatory regulations,i. e., regulations that prohibit all economically beneficial useof land: Any limitation so severe cannot be newly legislatedor decreed (without compensation), but must inhere in thetitle itself, in the restrictions that background principles ofthe State's law of property and nuisance already place uponland ownership. A law or decree with such an effect must,in other words, do no more than duplicate the result thatcould have been achieved in the courts--by adjacent landowners (or other uniquely affected persons) under the State'slaw of private nuisance, or by the State under its complementary power to abate nuisances that affect the public gener-ally, or otherwise.16On this analysis, the owner of a lakebed, for example,would not be entitled to compensation when he is denied therequisite permit to engage in a landfilling operation thatwould have the effect of flooding others' land. Nor the corporate owner of a nuclear generating plant, when it is di-rected to remove all improvements from its land upon discovery that the plant sits astride an earthquake fault. Suchregulatory action may well have the effect of eliminating theland's only economically productive use, but it does not proscribe a productive use that was previously permissible16 The principal "otherwise" that we have in mind is litigation absolvingthe State (or private parties) of liability for the destruction of "real andpersonal property, in cases of actual necessity, to prevent the spreading ofa fire" or to forestall other grave threats to the lives and property ofothers.

The useof these properties for what are now expressly prohibitedpurposes was always unlawful, and (subject to other consti-tutional limitations) it was open to the State at any point tomake the implication of those background principles of nuisance and property law explicit. See Michelman, Property,Utility, and Fairness, Comments on the Ethical Foundationsof "Just Compensation" Law, 80 Harv. L. Rev. 1165, 1239-1241 (1967).

S. 290, 295 (1967) (Stewart, J., concurring), this recognition that the Takings Clause does not require compensation when an owner is barred from puttingland to a use that is proscribed by those "existing rules orunderstandings" is surely unexceptional. When, however, aregulation that declares "off-limits" all economically productive or beneficial uses of land goes beyond what the relevantbackground principles would dictate, compensation must bepaid to sustain it.17The "total taking" inquiry we require today will ordinarilyentail (as the application of state nuisance law ordinarily entails) analysis of, among other things, the degree of harm topublic lands and resources, or adjacent private property,17 Of course, the State may elect to rescind its regulation and therebyavoid having to pay compensation for a permanent deprivation.
