S. 653 (1998)Opinion of the Courthibited the Union from striking against Textron for any rea-son and, through the adoption of a separate memorandumagreement, required Textron to give the Union seven days'notice before entering into any agreement to "subcontractout" work that would otherwise be performed by Unionmembers. In June 1994, Textron announced that it plannedto subcontract out a volume of work that would causeroughly one-half of the Union members to lose their jobs.Thereafter, in November 1995, the Union filed the pres-ent complaint in Federal District Court, alleging that Textron fraudulently induced the Union to sign the collective-bargaining agreement. Specifically, the Union claims thatboth before and during negotiations it repeatedly asked Tex-tron to provide any information it might have regardingplans to subcontract out work that would otherwise be per-formed by Union members; and that during negotiations,Textron had in fact completed such a plan, but despite theUnion's repeated requests said nothing about its existence.As redress, the Union seeks "a declaratory judgment thatthe existing collective bargaining agreement between theparties is voidable at the option of [the] UAW," and "compen-satory and punitive damages . . . to compensate [the Unionand its members] for the harm caused by [Textron's] misrep-resentations and concealments and to deter other Employersfrom similar conduct." App. 19. The Union does not allegethat either it or Textron ever violated the terms of thecollective-bargaining agreement. As the basis of federalsubject-matter jurisdiction, the complaint invokes $ 301(a) ofthe Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U. S. C. $ 185(a).11 The Union's brief before this Court asserts, in a footnote and withoutelaboration, that "there may well be jurisdiction over this case under 28U. S. C. $ 1331 as well as under $ 301, since the case `arises under' thefederal common law of contract." Brief for Respondents 23, n. 11.

AUTOMOBILE WORKERSOpinion of the CourtThe District Court dismissed the complaint for lack ofsubject-matter jurisdiction, concluding that the cause of action it set forth did not come within $ 301(a). The Court ofAppeals for the Third Circuit reversed, 117 F. 3d 119 (1997);we granted certiorari, 522 U. S. 979 (1997).IISection 301(a) of the Labor Management Relations Act,1947, provides:"Suits for violation of contracts between an employerand a labor organization representing employees in anindustry affecting commerce as defined in this Act, orbetween any such labor organizations, may be broughtin any district court of the United States having juris-diction of the parties, without respect to the amount incontroversy or without regard to the citizenship of theparties." 61 Stat. 156, 29 U. S. C. $ 185(a).By its terms, this provision confers federal subject-matterjurisdiction only over "[s]uits for violation of contracts."The Union, and the Government in an amicus brief filed insupport of the Union, contend that this includes suits alleging that a contract is invalid. Focusing on the breadth ofthe word "for," the Government argues that $ 301(a) "isbroad enough to encompass not only a suit that `alleges' aviolation of contract, but also one that concerns a violationof contract, or is intended to establish a legal right to engagein what otherwise would be a contract violation." Brief forUnited States as Amicus Curiae 11 (footnotes omitted). Itis true enough, as the Government points out, that one ofthe numerous definitions of the word "for" is "[i]ndicatingthe end with reference to which anything acts, serves, or isdone; . . . . As a preparation towards, against, or in view of;having as goal or object; . . . . With the purpose or objectof; . . . with a view to."

S. 653 (1998)Opinion of the Courttionary 984 (2d ed. 1950) (def. 2). Even applying that defi-nition, the Government must make a considerable stretchto bring the present case within it. This suit obviously doesnot have as its "purpose or object" violation of any contract.The most the Government can assert (and it falls short of thedefinition) is that the suit seeks to facilitate "what otherwisewould be . . . contract violation[s]." Brief for United States11 (emphasis added).More basically, however, it is a "fundamental principle ofstatutory construction (and, indeed, of language itself) thatthe meaning of a word cannot be determined in isolation, butmust be drawn from the context in which it is used." Dealv. United States, 508 U. S. 129, 132 (1993). Accord, Cohen v.de la Cruz, ante, at 220. It is not the meaning of "for" weare seeking here, but the meaning of "[s]uits for violationof contracts." That phrase cannot possibly bear the meaning ascribed to it by the Government. No one, for example,would describe a corporation's harassing lawsuit against acompetitor as a "suit for unfair competition," even thoughthat is precisely its "goal or object." In the same vein, asuit "for violation of a contract" is not one filed "with a viewto" a future contract violation (much less to facilitate actionthat "otherwise would be" a contract violation). It is onefiled because a contract has been violated, just as a suit "forunfair competition" is one filed because unfair competitionhas occurred. In this context, the word "for" has an unmistakably backward-looking connotation, i. e., "[i]ndicating thecause, motive, or occasion of an act, state, or condition; hence,because of; on account of; in consequence of; as the effectof; for the sake of; as, cursed himself for showing leniency."Webster's New International Dictionary 984 (2d ed. 1950)(def. 7). "Suits for violation of contracts" under $ 301(a) arenot suits that claim a contract is invalid, but suits that claima contract has been violated.This does not mean that a federal court can never adjudicate the validity of a contract under $ 301(a). That provision523US3 Unit: $U62 [05-09-00 11:31:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN658 TEXTRON LYCOMING RECIPROCATING ENGINE DIV.,AVCO CORP. v. AUTOMOBILE WORKERSOpinion of the Courtsimply erects a gateway through which parties may pass intofederal court; once they have entered, it does not restrict thelegal landscape they may traverse. Thus if, in the courseof deciding whether a plaintiff is entitled to relief for thedefendant's alleged violation of a contract, the defendant in-terposes the affirmative defense that the contract was invalid, the court may, consistent with $ 301(a), adjudicate thatdefense. SeeKaiser Steel Corp. v. Mullins, 455 U. S. 72,85-86 (1982). Similarly, a declaratory judgment plaintiff accused of violating a collective-bargaining agreement may aska court to declare the agreement invalid. But in these cases,the federal court's power to adjudicate the contract's validityis ancillary to, and not independent of, its power to adjudi-cate "[s]uits for violation of contracts."This would seem to be the end of the matter. Here, theUnion neither alleges that Textron has violated the contract,nor seeks declaratory relief from its own alleged violation.Indeed, as far as the Union's complaint discloses, both partiesare in absolute compliance with the terms of the collective-bargaining agreement. Section 301(a) jurisdiction does notlie over such a case.The Union, however, asserts that the outcome is alteredby the fact that it seeks relief pursuant to the DeclaratoryJudgment Act, 28 U. S. C. $ 2201.2 It argues that in orderto determine whether $ 301(a) jurisdiction lies over thedeclaratory-judgment aspect of its suit, we must look to thecharacter of the threatened action to which its suit wouldinterpose a defense, which in this case would be Textron'saction for breach of the collective-bargaining agreement. Itrelies on our decision in Skelly Oil Co. v. Phillips Petroleum2 The Declaratory Judgment Act provides, in relevant part, that "[i]n acase of actual controversy within its jurisdiction, . . . any court of theUnited States, upon the filing of an appropriate pleading, may declare therights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration, whether or not further relief is or could be sought." 28 U. S. C.$ 2201(a).523US3 Unit: $U62 [05-09-00 11:31:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN659Cite as: 523 U. S. 653 (1998)Opinion of the CourtCo., 339 U. S. 667 (1950), which held that a declaratory actionasserting a federal defense to a nonfederal claim was not a"civil actio[n] arising under the . . . laws . . . of the UnitedStates" within the meaning of the federal-question jurisdiction statute, 28 U. S. C. $ 1331. This argument makesseveral assumptions that we do not think can be indulged.First, it assumes that facts which were the converse ofSkelly Oil--i. e., a declaratory-judgment complaint raising anonfederal defense to an anticipated federal claim--wouldconfer $ 1331 jurisdiction. That is not clear. It can be ar-gued that anticipating a federal claim in a suit asserting anonfederal defense no more effectively invokes $ 1331 juris-diction than anticipating a federal defense in a suit assertinga nonfederal claim. (The latter, of course, is barred by thewell-pleaded-complaint rule, seeRivet v. Regions Bank ofLa., 522 U. S. 470, 475 (1998).) Perhaps it was the purposeof the Declaratory Judgment Act to permit such anticipa-tion, see Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal. v. Construction Laborers Vacation Trust for Southern Cal., 463 U. S. 1, 19,n. 19 (1983), butSkelly Oil did not present that issue, andsome of its language suggests that the declaratory-judgmentplaintiff must himself have a federal claim.3 No decision3 "Prior to [the Declaratory Judgment] Act, a federal court would entertain a suit on a contract only if the plaintiff asked for an immediatelyenforceable remedy like money damages or an injunction . . . . The Declaratory Judgment Act allowed relief to be given by way of recognizingthe plaintiff's right even though no immediate enforcement of it wasasked." Skelly Oil Co. v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 339 U. S. 667, 671-672(1950)."[I]t has been settled doctrine that where a suit is brought in the federalcourts `upon the sole ground that the determination of the suit dependsupon some question of a Federal nature, it must appear, at the outset,from the declaration or the bill of the party suing, that the suit is of thatcharacter.' But `a suggestion of one party, that the other will or may setup a claim under the Constitution or laws of the United States, does notmake the suit one arising under that Constitution or those laws.' " Id., at672, quoting Tennessee v. Union & Planters' Bank, 152 U. S. 454, 464(1894).523US3 Unit: $U62 [05-09-00 11:31:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN660 TEXTRON LYCOMING RECIPROCATING ENGINE DIV.,AVCO CORP. v. AUTOMOBILE WORKERSOpinion of the Courtof this Court has squarely confronted and explicitly upheldfederal-question jurisdiction on the basis of the anticipatedclaim against which the declaratory-judgment plaintiff pre-sents a nonfederal defense; and neither the Union nor theGovernment cites such a decision by any other federal court.4Second, the Union's Skelly Oil argument assumes thatwhat would suffice to sustain a declaratory-judgment actionpremised on $ 1331 federal-question jurisdiction would sufficeto sustain a declaratory-judgment action brought under$ 301(a). But the language of the two provisions is quitedifferent. Whereas $ 1331 authorizes "civil actions arisingunder the . . . laws . . . of the United States" (which canarguably embrace a civil action presenting a defense to afederal claim), $ 301(a) authorizes only "[s]uits for violationof contracts."But assuming (without deciding) that the converse ofSkelly Oil confers $ 1331 jurisdiction, and that what sufficesfor $ 1331 suffices for $ 301(a) as well, the Union's prayer fora declaration that the collective-bargaining agreement wasvoidable is in our view inadequate to save the present suit,because it does not, and as far as the record shows it neverdid, present a case or controversy giving the Union accessto federal courts. That is obviously so at the present time,because the collective-bargaining agreement, whether voidable or not, has expired; the only question is whether theparties had any concrete dispute over the contract's voidability at the time the suit was filed.4 In Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal. v. Construction Laborers VacationTrust for Southern Cal., 463 U. S. 1 (1983), we observed, with seemingapproval, that "[f]ederal courts have regularly taken original jurisdictionover declaratory judgment suits in which, if the declaratory judgmentdefendant brought a coercive action to enforce its rights, that suit wouldnecessarily present a federal question." Id., at 19. The cases broughtforward to support that observation, however, were suits by allegedpatent infringers to declare a patent invalid, which of course themselvesraise a federal question. See id., at 19, n. 19.523US3 Unit: $U62 [05-09-00 11:31:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN661Cite as: 523 U. S. 653 (1998)Opinion of the CourtWe see no evidence that they did. To be sure, Textronvigorously contested the complaint's allegations of fraud thatare the asserted cause of the claimed voidability as well asof the claimed damages; but that is no indication that Textronhad any interest in defending the binding nature of the con-tract. Indeed, there is not even any indication that theUnion had a concrete interest in establishing the nonbindingnature of the contract. This was not (as one might haveexpected in a declaratory-judgment suit of this sort) a situa-tion in which the Union had threatened to strike over thecontracting-out, and Textron had asserted that a strikewould violate the collective-bargaining agreement. TheUnion never threatened to strike. As far as appears, thecompany that had just eliminated the work of half its Williamsport employees would have been perfectly willing to beexcused from a contract negotiated when the Union was in astronger bargaining position, and the Union had no intent ordisposition to exercise a theoretical option to avoid a contractthat was better than what it could negotiate anew. The factthat the fraud damages claim, if successful, would establisha voidability that (as far as appears) no one cared about, doesnot make the question of voidability a "case of actual controversy," 28 U. S. C. $ 2201, over which federal courts have$ 301(a) jurisdiction.
