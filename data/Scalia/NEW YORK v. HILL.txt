This case presents the question whether defense counsel'sagreement to a trial date outside the time period requiredby Article III of the Interstate Agreement on Detainersbars the defendant from seeking dismissal because trial didnot occur within that period.IThe Interstate Agreement on Detainers (IAD) is a com-pact entered into by 48 States, the United States, and theDistrict of Columbia to establish procedures for resolution ofone State's outstanding charges against a prisoner of anotherState. See N. Y. Crim. Proc. Law $ 580.20 (McKinney 1995);18 U. S. C. App. $ 2; 11A U. L. A. 48 (1995) (listing jurisdictions). As "a congressionally sanctioned interstate com-pact" within the Compact Clause of the United States Constitution, Art. I, $ 10, cl. 3, the IAD is a federal law subjectto federal construction.Carchman v. Nash, 473 U. S. 716,719 (1985);Cuyler v. Adams, 449 U. S. 433, 442 (1981).528US1 Unit: $U13 [06-14-01 18:45:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN112 NEW YORK v. HILLOpinion of the CourtA State seeking to bring charges against a prisoner in an-other State's custody begins the process by filing a detainer,which is a request by the State's criminal justice agency thatthe institution in which the prisoner is housed hold theprisoner for the agency or notify the agency when release isimminent. Fex v. Michigan, 507 U. S. 43, 44 (1993). Aftera detainer has been lodged against him, a prisoner may filea "request for a final disposition to be made of the indictment, information, or complaint." Art. III(a). Upon sucha request, the prisoner "shall be brought to trial within onehundred eighty days," "provided that for good cause shownin open court, the prisoner or his counsel being present, thecourt having jurisdiction of the matter may grant any neces-sary or reasonable continuance."Ibid. Resolution of thecharges can also be triggered by the charging jurisdiction,which may request temporary custody of the prisoner forthat purpose. Art. IV(a). In such a case, "trial shall becommenced within one hundred twenty days of the arrivalof the prisoner in the receiving state," subject again to continuances for good cause shown in open court. Art. IV(c).If a defendant is not brought to trial within the applicablestatutory period, the IAD requires that the indictment bedismissed with prejudice. Art. V(c).In this case, New York lodged a detainer against respond-ent, who was a prisoner in Ohio. Respondent signed a request for disposition of the detainer pursuant to Article IIIof the IAD, and was returned to New York to face murderand robbery charges. Defense counsel filed several motions,which, it is uncontested, tolled the time limits during theirpendency.On January 9, 1995, the prosecutor and defense counselappeared in court to set a trial date. The following collo-quy ensued:"[Prosecutor]: Your Honor, [the regular attorney] fromour office is engaged in a trial today. He told me that528US1 Unit: $U13 [06-14-01 18:45:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN113Cite as: 528 U. S. 110 (2000)Opinion of the Courtthe Court was to set a trial date today. I believe theCourt may have preliminarily discussed a May 1st date,and [the regular attorney] says that would fit in hiscalendar."The Court: How is that with the defense counsel?"[Defense Counsel]: That will be fine, Your Honor."164 Misc. 2d 1032, 1035, 627 N. Y. S. 2d 234, 236 (Cty.Ct., Monroe County 1995).The court scheduled trial to begin on May 1.On April 17, 1995, respondent moved to dismiss the indictment, arguing that the IAD's time limit had expired.The trial court found that as of January 9, 1995, when thetrial date was set, 167 nonexcludable days had elapsed, sothat if the subsequent time period was chargeable to theState, the 180-day time period had indeed expired. However, the trial court concluded that "[d]efense counsel's explicit agreement to the trial date set beyond the 180 daystatutory period constituted a waiver or abandonment of defendant's rights under the IAD." Id., at 1036, 627 N. Y. S.2d, at 237. Accordingly, the court denied respondent's motion to dismiss.Respondent was subsequently convicted, following a jurytrial, of murder in the second degree and robbery in thefirst degree. On appeal, respondent argued that the trialcourt erred in declining to dismiss the indictment for lackof a timely trial under the IAD. The New York SupremeCourt, Appellate Division, affirmed the decision of the trialcourt. 244 App. Div. 2d 927, 668 N. Y. S. 2d 126 (1997). TheNew York Court of Appeals, however, reversed and orderedthat the indictment against respondent be dismissed; defense counsel's agreement to a later trial date, it held, didnot waive respondent's speedy trial rights under the IAD.92 N. Y. 2d 406, 704 N. E. 2d 542 (1998). We granted certiorari. 526 U. S. 1111 (1999).528US1 Unit: $U13 [06-14-01 18:45:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN114 NEW YORK v. HILLOpinion of the CourtIINo provision of the IAD prescribes the effect of a defend-ant's assent to delay on the applicable time limits. We have,however, "in the context of a broad array of constitutionaland statutory provisions," articulated a general rule thatpresumes the availability of waiver, United States v. Mezzanatto, 513 U. S. 196, 200-201 (1995), and we have recognizedthat "[t]he most basic rights of criminal defendants are . . .subject to waiver," Peretz v. United States, 501 U. S. 923,936 (1991). In accordance with these principles, courts haveagreed that a defendant may, at least under some circum-stances, waive his right to object to a given delay under theIAD, although they have disagreed on what is necessary toeffect a waiver. See, e. g., People v. Jones, 197 Mich. App.76, 80, 495 N. W. 2d 159, 160 (1992) (waiver if prisoner "eitherexpressly or impliedly, agrees or requests to be treated in amanner contrary to the terms of the IAD"); Brown v. Wolff,706 F. 2d 902, 907 (CA9 1983) (waiver if prisoner "affirma-tively requests to be treated in a manner contrary to theprocedures prescribed by the IAD"); Drescher v. SuperiorCt., 218 Cal. App. 3d 1140, 1148, 267 Cal. Rptr. 661, 666 (1990)(waiver if there is a "showing of record that the defendantor his attorney freely acquiesced in a trial date beyond thespeedy trial period" (internal quotation marks omitted)).What suffices for waiver depends on the nature of the rightat issue. "[W]hether the defendant must participate person-ally in the waiver; whether certain procedures are requiredfor waiver; and whether the defendant's choice must be par-ticularly informed or voluntary, all depend on the right atstake." United States v. Olano, 507 U. S. 725, 733 (1993).For certain fundamental rights, the defendant must personally make an informed waiver. See, e. g., Johnson v. Zerbst,304 U. S. 458, 464-465 (1938) (right to counsel);Brookhart v.Janis, 384 U. S. 1, 7-8 (1966) (right to plead not guilty). Forother rights, however, waiver may be effected by action ofcounsel. "Although there are basic rights that the attorney528US1 Unit: $U13 [06-14-01 18:45:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN115Cite as: 528 U. S. 110 (2000)Opinion of the Courtcannot waive without the fully informed and publicly ac-knowledged consent of the client, the lawyer has--and musthave--full authority to manage the conduct of the trial."Taylor v. Illinois, 484 U. S. 400, 417-418 (1988). As to manydecisions pertaining to the conduct of the trial, the defend-ant is "deemed bound by the acts of his lawyer-agent andis considered to have `notice of all facts, notice of whichcan be charged upon the attorney.' " Link v. Wabash R. Co.,370 U. S. 626, 634 (1962) (quotingSmith v. Ayer, 101 U. S.320, 326 (1880)). Thus, decisions by counsel are generallygiven effect as to what arguments to pursue, seeJones v.Barnes, 463 U. S. 745, 751 (1983), what evidentiary objectionsto raise, see Henry v. Mississippi, 379 U. S. 443, 451 (1965),and what agreements to conclude regarding the admissionof evidence, see United States v. McGill, 11 F. 3d 223, 226-227 (CA1 1993). Absent a demonstration of ineffectiveness,counsel's word on such matters is the last.Scheduling matters are plainly among those for whichagreement by counsel generally controls. This case doesnot involve a purported prospective waiver of all protection of the IAD's time limits or of the IAD generally, butmerely agreement to a specified delay in trial. When thatsubject is under consideration, only counsel is in a positionto assess the benefit or detriment of the delay to the defendant's case. Likewise, only counsel is in a position to assesswhether the defense would even be prepared to proceed anyearlier. Requiring express assent from the defendant himself for such routine and often repetitive scheduling determinations would consume time to no apparent purpose. Thetext of the IAD, moreover, confirms what the reason of thematter suggests: In allowing the court to grant "good-causecontinuances" when either "prisoner or his counsel" is present, it contemplates that scheduling questions may be left tocounsel. Art. III(a) (emphasis added).Respondent offers two arguments for affirmance, bothof which go primarily to the propriety of allowing waiver of528US1 Unit: $U13 [06-14-01 18:45:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN116 NEW YORK v. HILLOpinion of the Courtany sort, not to the specifics of the waiver here. First, heargues that by explicitly providing for the grant of "goodcause continuances," the IAD seeks to limit the situationsin which delay is permitted, and that permitting other extensions of the time period would override those limitations.It is of course true that waiver is not appropriate when itis inconsistent with the provision creating the right soughtto be secured. E. g., Crosby v. United States, 506 U. S. 255,258-259 (1993);Smith v. United States, 360 U. S. 1, 9 (1959).That is not, however, the situation here. To be sure, the"necessary or reasonable continuance" provision is, by clearimplication, the sole means by which the prosecution canobtain an extension of the time limits over the defendant'sobjection. But the specification in that provision that the"prisoner or his counsel" must be present suggests that itis directed primarily, if not indeed exclusively, to prosecu-tion requests that have not explicitly been agreed to by thedefense. As applied to agreed-upon extensions, we think itsnegative implication is dubious--and certainly not clearenough to constitute the "affirmative indication" required toovercome the ordinary presumption that waiver is available.Mezzanatto, supra, at 201.1Second, respondent argues that the IAD benefits not onlythe defendant but society generally, and that the defendantmay not waive society's rights. It is true that a "right conferred on a private party, but affecting the public interest,may not be waived or released if such waiver or releasecontravenes the statutory policy." Brooklyn Savings Bankv. O'Neil, 324 U. S. 697, 704 (1945) (emphasis added). The1 It was suggested at oral argument that agreement in open court to atrial date outside the allowable time period can itself be viewed as a "necessary or reasonable continuance" for "good cause shown in open court."Although an agreed-upon trial date might sometimes merit this description, it is far from clear that it always does so, or that it does so here.Because we find waiver, we do not consider under what circumstances anagreed-upon delay could fit within the good-cause provision.528US1 Unit: $U13 [06-14-01 18:45:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN117Cite as: 528 U. S. 110 (2000)Opinion of the Courtconditional clause is essential, however: It is not true thatany private right that also benefits society cannot be waived.In general, "[i]n an adversary system of criminal justice,the public interest in the administration of justice is protected by the participants in the litigation." Gannett Co. v.DePasquale, 443 U. S. 368, 383 (1979). We allow waiver ofnumerous constitutional protections for criminal defendantsthat also serve broader social interests. See, e. g., Adams v.United States ex rel. McCann, 317 U. S. 269, 275 (1942)(waiver of right to jury trial); Johnson, 304 U. S., at 464(waiver of right to counsel).Society may well enjoy some benefit from the IAD's timelimits: Delay can lead to a less accurate outcome as witnessesbecome unavailable and memories fade. See, e. g., Sibron v.New York, 392 U. S. 40, 56-57 (1968). On the other hand,some social interests served by prompt trial are less relevanthere than elsewhere. For example, because the would-bedefendant is already incarcerated in another jurisdiction,society's interests in assuring the defendant's presence attrial and in preventing further criminal activity (or avoidingthe costs of pretrial detention) are simply not at issue.Cf. Barker v. Wingo, 407 U. S. 514, 519 (1972). In any case,it cannot be argued that society's interest in the prompt resolution of outstanding charges is so central to the IAD thatit is part of the unalterable "statutory policy," BrooklynSavings Bank, supra, at 704. In fact, the time limits donot apply at all unless either the prisoner or the receivingState files a request.2 Thus, the IAD "contemplate[s] a de2 This feature, among others, makes respondent's analogy to the federal Speedy Trial Act of 1974, 18 U. S. C. $ 3161 et seq., inapt.

Taylor, 487 U. S. 326, 332-333 (1988); andwaiver is expressly allowed in certain limited circumstances, 18 U. S. C.$ 3162(a)(2). In any event, the question of waiver under the Speedy TrialAct is not before us today, and we express no view on the subject.528US1 Unit: $U13 [06-14-01 18:45:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN118 NEW YORK v. HILLOpinion of the Courtgree of party control that is consonant with the backgroundpresumption of waivability." Mezzanatto, 513 U. S., at 206.3Finally, respondent argues that even if waiver of the IAD'stime limits is possible, it can be effected only by affirmativeconduct not present here. The New York Court of Appealsadopted a similar view, stating that the speedy trial rightsguaranteed by the IAD may be waived either "explicitly orby an affirmative request for treatment that is contrary toor inconsistent with those speedy trial rights." 92 N. Y. 2d,at 411, 704 N. E. 2d, at 545. The court concluded that defense counsel's agreement to the trial date here was not an"affirmative request" and therefore did not constitute awaiver. Id., at 412, 704 N. E. 2d, at 546. We agree withthe State that this makes dismissal of the indictment turnon a hypertechnical distinction that should play no part. Asillustrated by this case, such an approach would enable defendants to escape justice by willingly accepting treatmentinconsistent with the IAD's time limits, and then recantinglater on. Nothing in the IAD requires or even suggests adistinction between waiver proposed and waiver agreed to.In light of its potential for abuse--and given the harsh rem-edy of dismissal with prejudice--we decline to adopt it.* * *The judgment of the New York Court of Appeals isreversed.
