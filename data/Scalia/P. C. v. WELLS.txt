The Supreme Court of South Carolina dismissed petitioner's lawsuit against Richland County (hereinafter respondent) as time barred. In doing so it held that 28 U. S. C.$ 1367(d), which required the state statute of limitations tobe tolled for the period during which petitioner's cause ofaction had previously been pending in federal court, is unconstitutional as applied to lawsuits brought against a State'spolitical subdivisions. The issue before us is the validity ofthat constitutional determination.IAWhen a federal district court has original jurisdiction overa civil cause of action, $ 1367 determines whether it may exercise supplemental jurisdiction over other claims that donot independently come within its jurisdiction, but that formpart of the same Article III "case or controversy." Section1367(a) provides:"Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c) or as expressly provided otherwise by Federal statute, in anycivil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction, the district courts shall have supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related toclaims in the action within such original jurisdiction thatthey form part of the same case or controversy underArticle III of the United States Constitution.

S. 456 (2003)Opinion of the Courtsupplemental jurisdiction shall include claims that in-volve the joinder or intervention of additional parties."As the introductory clause suggests, not every claim withinthe same "case or controversy" as the claim within the federal courts' original jurisdiction will be decided by the fed-eral court; $$ 1367(b) and (c) describe situations in which afederal court may or must decline to exercise supplementaljurisdiction. Section 1367(c), for example, states:"The district courts may decline to exercise supplemen-tal jurisdiction over a claim under subsection (a) if--"(1) the claim raises a novel or complex issue of Statelaw,"(2) the claim substantially predominates over the claimor claims over which the district court has originaljurisdiction,"(3) the district court has dismissed all claims overwhich it has original jurisdiction, or"(4) in exceptional circumstances, there are other com-pelling reasons for declining jurisdiction."Thus, some claims asserted under $ 1367(a) will be dismissedbecause the district court declines to exercise jurisdictionover them and, if they are to be pursued, must be refiledin state court. To prevent the limitations period on suchsupplemental claims from expiring while the plaintiff wasfruitlessly pursuing them in federal court, $ 1367(d) providesa tolling rule that must be applied by state courts:"The period of limitations for any claim asserted undersubsection (a), and for any other claim in the same actionthat is voluntarily dismissed at the same time as or afterthe dismissal of the claim under subsection (a), shall betolled while the claim is pending and for a period of 30days after it is dismissed unless State law provides fora longer tolling period."538US2 Unit: $U43 [10-27-04 11:18:54] PAGES PGT: OPIN460 JINKS v. RICHLAND COUNTYOpinion of the CourtBOn October 14, 1994, Carl H. Jinks was arrested and jailedfor failure to pay child support. Four days later, while confined at respondent's detention center, he died of complications associated with alcohol withdrawal. In 1996, withinthe applicable statute of limitations, petitioner Susan Jinks,Carl Jinks's widow, brought an action in the United StatesDistrict Court for the District of South Carolina against respondent, its detention center director, and its detention center physician. She asserted a cause of action under Rev.Stat. $ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, and also supplemental claimsfor wrongful death and survival under the South CarolinaTort Claims Act. See S. C. Code Ann. $ 15-78-10 et seq.(West Supp. 2002). On November 20, 1997, the DistrictCourt granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment on the $ 1983 claim, and two weeks later issued an orderdeclining to exercise jurisdiction over the remaining statelaw claims, dismissing them without prejudice pursuant to28 U. S. C. $ 1367(c)(3).On December 18, 1997, petitioner filed her wrongful-deathand survival claims in state court. After the jury returneda verdict of $80,000 against respondent on the wrongfuldeath claim, respondent appealed to the South Carolina Supreme Court, which reversed on the ground that petitioner'sstate-law claims were time barred. Although they wouldnot have been time barred under $ 1367(d)'s tolling rule, theState Supreme Court held that $ 1367(d) was unconstitutional as applied to claims brought in state court against aState's political subdivisions, because it "interferes with theState's sovereign authority to establish the extent to whichits political subdivisions are subject to suit." 349 S.

S. 456 (2003)Opinion of the CourtIIARespondent and its amici first contend that $ 1367(d) isfacially invalid because it exceeds the enumerated powersof Congress. We disagree. Although the Constitution doesnot expressly empower Congress to toll limitations periodsfor state-law claims brought in state court, it does give Con-gress the authority "[t]o make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution [Congress's Ar-ticle I, $ 8,] Powers and all other Powers vested by thisConstitution in the Government of the United States . . . ."Art. I, $ 8, cl. 18. The enactment of $ 1367(d) was not thefirst time Congress prescribed the alteration of a state-lawlimitations period;1 nor is this the first case in which we haveruled on its authority to do so. In Stewart v. Kahn, 11 Wall.1 See, e. g., Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940, 50 U. S. C. App.$ 525 ("The period of military service shall not be included in computingany period now or hereafter to be limited by any law, regulation, or orderfor the bringing of any action or proceeding in any court . . . by or againstany person in military service"); 42 U. S.

RICHLAND COUNTYOpinion of the Court493 (1871), we upheld as constitutional a federal statute thattolled limitations periods for state-law civil and criminalcases for the time during which actions could not be prose-cuted because of the Civil War. We reasoned that this lawwas both necessary and proper to carrying into effect theFederal Government's war powers, because it "remed[ied]the evils" that had arisen from the war. "It would be astrange result if those in rebellion, by protracting the conflict, could thus rid themselves of their debts, and Congress,which had the power to wage war and suppress the insurrection, had no power to remedy such an evil, which is one ofits consequences."Id., at 507.Of course $ 1367(d) has nothing to do with the war power.We agree with petitioner and intervenor United States, how-ever, that $ 1367(d) is necessary and proper for carrying intoexecution Congress's power "[t]o constitute Tribunals infe-rior to the supreme Court," U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 8, cl. 9,and to assure that those tribunals may fairly and efficientlyexercise "[t]he judicial Power of the United States," Art. III,$ 1. As to "necessity": The federal courts can assuredlyexist and function in the absence of $ 1367(d), but we longago rejected the view that the Necessary and Proper Clausedemands that an Act of Congress be " `absolutely neces-sary' " to the exercise of an enumerated power. See McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 414-415 (1819). Rather, itsuffices that $ 1367(d) is "conducive to the due administrationof justice" in federal court,2 and is "plainly adapted" to thatend, id., at 417, 421. Section 1367(d) is conducive to the administration of justice because it provides an alternative tothe unsatisfactory options that federal judges faced whenthey decided whether to retain jurisdiction over supplemen-tal state-law claims that might be time barred in state court.In the pre-$ 1367(d) world, they had three basic choices:2 This was Chief Justice Marshall's description in McCulloch of why--by way of example--legislation punishing perjury in the federal courts isvalid under the Necessary and Proper Clause. See 4 Wheat., at 417.538US2 Unit: $U43 [10-27-04 11:18:54] PAGES PGT: OPIN463Cite as: 538 U. S. 456 (2003)Opinion of the CourtFirst, they could condition dismissal of the state-law claimon the defendant's waiver of any statute-of-limitations defense in state court. See, e. g., Duckworth v. Franzen, 780F. 2d 645, 657 (CA7 1985);Financial General Bankshares,Inc. v. Metzger, 680 F. 2d 768, 778 (CADC 1982). Thatwaiver could be refused, however, in which case one of theremaining two choices would have to be pursued. Second,they could retain jurisdiction over the state-law claim eventhough it would more appropriately be heard in state court.See Newman v. Burgin, 930 F. 2d 955, 963-964 (CA1 1991)(collecting cases). That would produce an obvious frustration of statutory policy. And third, they could dismiss thestate-law claim but allow the plaintiff to reopen the federalcase if the state court later held the claim to be time barred.See, e. g., Rheaume v. Texas Dept. of Public Safety, 666 F. 2d925, 932 (CA5 1982). That was obviously inefficient. Byproviding a straightforward tolling rule in place of this regime, $ 1367(d) unquestionably promotes fair and efficient operation of the federal courts and is therefore conducive tothe administration of justice.And it is conducive to the administration of justice for another reason: It eliminates a serious impediment to access tothe federal courts on the part of plaintiffs pursuing federaland state-law claims that "derive from a common nucleus ofoperative fact," Mine Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U. S. 715, 725(1966). Prior to enactment of $ 1367(d), they had the following unattractive options: (1) They could file a single federalcourt action, which would run the risk that the federal courtwould dismiss the state-law claims after the limitations period had expired; (2) they could file a single state-law action,which would abandon their right to a federal forum; (3) theycould file separate, timely actions in federal and state courtand ask that the state-court litigation be stayed pending resolution of the federal case, which would increase litigationcosts with no guarantee that the state court would oblige.Section 1367(d) replaces this selection of inadequate choices538US2 Unit: $U43 [10-27-04 11:18:54] PAGES PGT: OPIN464 JINKS v. RICHLAND COUNTYOpinion of the Courtwith the assurance that state-law claims asserted under$ 1367(a) will not become time barred while pending in federal court.We are also persuaded, and respondent does not deny, that$ 1367(d) is "plainly adapted" to the power of Congress toestablish the lower federal courts and provide for the fairand efficient exercise of their Article III powers. There isno suggestion by either of the parties that Congress enacted$ 1367(d) as a "pretext" for "the accomplishment of objectsnot entrusted to the [federal] government," McCulloch,supra, at 423, nor is the connection between $ 1367(d) andCongress's authority over the federal courts so attenuatedas to undermine the enumeration of powers set forth in Article I, $ 8, cf. United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, 567-568(1995); United States v. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598, 615 (2000).Respondent and its amici further contend, however, that$ 1367(d) is not a "proper" exercise of Congress's Article Ipowers because it violates principles of state sovereignty.See Printz v. United States, 521 U. S. 898, 923-924 (1997).Respondent views $ 1367(d)'s tolling rule as a regulation ofstate-court "procedure," and contends that Congress maynot, consistent with the Constitution, prescribe proceduralrules for state courts' adjudication of purely state-law claims.See, e. g., Bellia, Federal Regulation of State Court Procedures, 110 Yale L. J. 947 (2001); Congressional Authority toRequire State Courts to Use Certain Procedures in ProductsLiability Cases, 13 Op. Off. Legal Counsel 372, 373-374(1989) (stating that "potential constitutional questions" arisewhen Congress "attempts to prescribe directly the statecourt procedures to be followed in products liability cases").Assuming for the sake of argument that a principled dichotomy can be drawn, for purposes of determining whether anAct of Congress is "proper," between federal laws that regulate state-court "procedure" and laws that change the "substance" of state-law rights of action, we do not think that538US2 Unit: $U43 [10-27-04 11:18:54] PAGES PGT: OPIN465Cite as: 538 U. S. 456 (2003)Opinion of the Courtstate-law limitations periods fall into the category of "proce-dure" immune from congressional regulation. Respondent'sreliance on Sun Oil Co. v. Wortman, 486 U. S. 717 (1988),which held a state statute of limitations to be "procedural"for purposes of the Full Faith and Credit Clause, is mis-placed. As we noted in that very case, the meaning of" `substance' " and " `procedure' " in a particular context is"largely determined by the purposes for which the dichotomy is drawn." Id., at 726. For purposes of Erie R. Co. v.Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64 (1938), for example, statutes of limita-tions are treated as substantive. Guaranty Trust Co. v.York, 326 U. S. 99 (1945). Stewart v. Kahn, 11 Wall., at 506-507, provides ample support for the proposition that--if thesubstance-procedure dichotomy posited by respondent isvalid--the tolling of limitations periods falls on the "substantive" side of the line. To sustain $ 1367(d) in this case, weneed not (and do not) hold that Congress has unlimitedpower to regulate practice and procedure in state courts.We therefore reject respondent's contention that $ 1367(d)is facially unconstitutional. BRespondent next maintains that $ 1367(d) should not beinterpreted to apply to claims brought against a State's political subdivisions. We find this contention also to be with-out merit.The South Carolina Tort Claims Act, S. C. Code Ann. $ 15-78-10 et seq. (West Supp. 2002), confers upon respondent animmunity from tort liability for any claim brought more thantwo years after the injury was or should have been discov-ered. In respondent's view, $ 1367(d)'s extension of the timeperiod in which a State's political subdivisions may be suedconstitutes an impermissible abrogation of "sovereign immunity." That is not so. Although we have held that Con-gress lacks authority under Article I to override aState'simmunity from suit in its own courts, see Alden v. Maine,538US2 Unit: $U43 [10-27-04 11:18:54] PAGES PGT: OPIN466 JINKS v. RICHLAND COUNTYOpinion of the Court527 U. S. 706 (1999), it may subject a municipality to suit instate court if that is done pursuant to a valid exercise of itsenumerated powers, see id., at 756. Section 1367(d) tolls thelimitations period with respect to state-law causes of actionbrought against municipalities, but we see no reason whythat represents a greater intrusion on "state sovereignty"than the undisputed power of Congress to override state-lawimmunity when subjecting a municipality to suit under a federal cause of action. In either case, a State's authority toset the conditions upon which its political subdivisions aresubject to suit in its own courts must yield to the enactmentsof Congress. This is not an encroachment on "state sovereignty," but merely the consequence of those cases (whichrespondent does not ask us to overrule) which hold that municipalities, unlike States, do not enjoy a constitutionally protected immunity from suit.Nor do we see any reason to construe $ 1367(d) not to applyto claims brought against a State's political subdivisions absent an "unmistakably clear" statement of the statute's applicability to such claims. Although we held in Raygor v. Regents of Univ. of Minn., 534 U. S. 533 (2002), that $ 1367(d)does not apply to claims filed in federal court against Statesbut subsequently dismissed on sovereign immunity grounds,we did so to avoid interpreting the statute in a manner thatwould raise "serious constitutional doubt" in light of ourdecisions protecting a State's sovereign immunity fromcongressional abrogation, id., at 543. As we have justexplained, however, no such constitutional doubt arises fromholding that petitioner's claim against respondent--which isnot a State, but a political subdivision of a State--falls underthe definition of "any claim asserted under subsection (a)."$ 1367(d) (emphasis added). In any event, the idea that an"unmistakably clear" statement is required before an Act ofCongress may expose a local government to liability cannotpossibly be reconciled with our holding in Monell v. New538US2 Unit: $U43 [10-27-04 11:18:54] PAGES PGT: OPIN467Cite as: 538 U. S. 456 (2003)Souter, J., concurringYork City Dept. of Social Servs., 436 U.
