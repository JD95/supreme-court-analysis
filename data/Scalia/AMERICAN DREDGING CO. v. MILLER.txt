This case presents the question whether, in admiraltycases filed in a state court under the Jones Act, 46 U. S. C.App. $ 688, and the "saving to suitors clause," 28 U. S. C.$ 1333(1), federal law pre-empts state law regarding the doctrine of forum non conveniens.IRespondent William Robert Miller, a resident of Missis-sippi, moved to Pennsylvania to seek employment in 1987.He was hired by petitioner American Dredging Company, aPennsylvania corporation with its principal place of businessin New Jersey, to work as a seaman aboard the MV John R.,a tug operating on the Delaware River. In the course ofthat employment respondent was injured. After receivingmedical treatment in Pennsylvania and New York, he returned to Mississippi where he continued to be treated bylocal physicians.On December 1, 1989, respondent filed this action in theCivil District Court for the Parish of Orleans, Louisiana.He sought relief under the Jones Act, which authorizes a sea-man who suffers personal injury "in the course of his employment" to bring "an action for damages at law," 46 U. S. C.App. $ 688(a), and over which state and federal courts haveconcurrent jurisdiction. See Engel v. Davenport, 271 U. S.33, 37 (1926). Respondent also requested relief under general maritime law for unseaworthiness, for wages, and formaintenance and cure. SeeMcAllister v. Magnolia Petro-leum Co., 357 U. S. 221, 224 (1958) (setting forth means ofrecovery available to injured seaman).The trial court granted petitioner's motion to dismiss theaction under the doctrine of forum non conveniens, holdingthat it was bound to apply that doctrine by federal maritimelaw. The Louisiana Court of Appeal for the Fourth Districtaffirmed. 580 So. 2d 1091 (1991). The Supreme Court ofLouisiana reversed, holding that Article 123(C) of the Louisi510us2$23K 06-19-97 22:51:48 PAGES OPINPGT446 AMERICAN DREDGING CO. v. MILLEROpinion of the Courtana Code of Civil Procedure, which renders the doctrine offorum non conveniens unavailable in Jones Act and maritime law cases brought in Louisiana state courts, is not pre-empted by federal maritime law. 595 So. 2d 615 (1992).American Dredging Company filed a petition for a writ ofcertiorari, which we granted. 507 U. S. 1028 (1993).IIThe Constitution provides that the federal judicial power"shall extend . . . to all Cases of admiralty and maritimeJurisdiction." U. S. Const., Art. III, $ 2, cl. 1. Federal-court jurisdiction over such cases, however, has never beenentirely exclusive. The Judiciary Act of 1789 provided:"That the district courts shall have, exclusively of thecourts of the several States . . . exclusive original cognizance of all civil causes of admiralty and maritime juris-diction . . . within their respective districts as well asupon the high seas; saving to suitors, in all cases, theright of a common law remedy, where the common lawis competent to give it." $ 9, 1 Stat. 76-77 (emphasisadded).The emphasized language is known as the "saving to suitorsclause." This provision has its modern expression at 28U. S. C. $ 1333(1), which reads (with emphasis added):"The district courts shall have original jurisdiction,exclusive of the courts of the States, of:"(1) Any civil case of admiralty or maritime jurisdic-tion, saving to suitors in all cases all other remedies towhich they are otherwise entitled."We have held it to be the consequence of exclusive federaljurisdiction that state courts "may not provide a remedyinrem for any cause of action within the admiralty jurisdiction." Red Cross Line v. Atlantic Fruit Co., 264 U. S. 109,124 (1924). An in rem suit against a vessel is, we have said,510us2$23K 06-19-97 22:51:48 PAGES OPINPGT447Cite as: 510 U.

In exercising in personamjurisdiction, however, a state court may " `adopt such remedies, and . . . attach to them such incidents, as it sees fit' solong as it does not attempt to make changes in the `substantive maritime law.' " Madruga v. Superior Court of Cal.,County of San Diego, 346 U. S. 556, 561 (1954) (quoting RedCross Line, supra, at 124). That proviso is violated whenthe state remedy "works material prejudice to the character-istic features of the general maritime law or interferes withthe proper harmony and uniformity of that law in its interna-tional and interstate relations."Southern Pacific Co. v.Jensen, 244 U. S. 205, 216 (1917). The issue before us hereis whether the doctrine of forum non conveniens is eithera "characteristic feature" of admiralty or a doctrine whoseuniform application is necessary to maintain the "proper har-mony" of maritime law. We think it is neither.1AUnder the federal doctrine of forum non conveniens,"when an alternative forum has jurisdiction to hear [a] case,and when trial in the chosen forum would `establish . . . op1 Justice Stevens asserts that we should not test the Louisiana lawagainst the standards of Jensen, a case which, though never explicitlyoverruled, is in his view as discredited as Lochner v. New York, 198 U. S.45 (1905). See post, at 458-459. Petitioner's pre-emption argument wasprimarily based upon the principles established in Jensen, as repeated inthe later cases (which Justice Stevens also disparages, see post, at 459)of Knickerbocker Ice Co. v. Stewart, 253 U. S. 149 (1920), and Washingtonv. W. C. Dawson & Co., 264 U.

Since we ultimately find that the Louisiana law meets the standards of Jensen anyway, we think it inappropriate to overrule Jensen indictum, and without argument or even invitation.510us2$23K 06-19-97 22:51:48 PAGES OPINPGT448 AMERICAN DREDGING CO. v.

S. 501(1947), Justice Jackson described some of the multifariousfactors relevant to the forum non conveniens determination:"An interest to be considered, and the one likely to bemost pressed, is the private interest of the litigant. Important considerations are the relative ease of access tosources of proof; availability of compulsory process forattendance of unwilling, and the cost of obtaining at-tendance of willing, witnesses; possibility of view ofpremises, if view would be appropriate to the action; andall other practical problems that make trial of a caseeasy, expeditious and inexpensive. There may also bequestions as to the enforcibility[sic] of a judgment ifone is obtained. . . ."Factors of public interest also have [a] place in apply-ing the doctrine. Administrative difficulties follow forcourts when litigation is piled up in congested centersinstead of being handled at its origin. Jury duty is aburden that ought not to be imposed upon the people ofa community which has no relation to the litigation. Incases which touch the affairs of many persons, there isreason for holding the trial in their view and reachrather than in remote parts of the country where theycan learn of it by report only. There is a local interestin having localized controversies decided at home.There is an appropriateness, too, in having the trial of adiversity case in a forum that is at home with the statelaw that must govern the case, rather than having a510us2$23K 06-19-97 22:51:48 PAGES OPINPGT449Cite as: 510 U.

Id., at 508-509.2Although the origins of the doctrine in Anglo-Americanlaw are murky, most authorities agree that forum non conveniens had its earliest expression not in admiralty but inScottish estate cases. See Macmaster v. Macmaster, 11Sess. Cas. 685, 687 (No. 280) (2d Div. Scot.) (1833); McMorinev. Cowie, 7 Sess. Cas. (2d ser.) 270, 272 (No. 48) (1st Div.Scot.) (1845); La Socie'te' du Gaz de Paris v. La Socie'te' Anonyme de Navigation "Les Armateurs Franc,ais," [1926] Sess.Cas. (H. L.) 13 (1925). See generally Speck, Forum NonConveniens and Choice of Law in Admiralty: Time for anOverhaul, 18 J. Mar. L. & Com. 185, 187 (1987); Barrett, TheDoctrine of Forum Non Conveniens, 35 Calif. L. Rev. 380,386-387 (1947); Braucher, The Inconvenient Federal Forum,60 Harv. L. Rev. 908, 909 (1947); but see Dainow, The Inap-propriate Forum, 29 Ill. L. Rev. 867, 881, n. 58 (1935) (doctrine in Scotland was "borrowed" from elsewhere beforemiddle of 19th century).Even within the United States alone, there is no basis forregardingforum non conveniens as a doctrine that origi-nated in admiralty. To be sure, within federal courts it mayhave been given its earliest and most frequent expression inadmiralty cases. SeeThe Maggie Hammond, 9 Wall. 435,457 (1870); The Belgenland, 114 U. S. 355, 365-366 (1885).2 Gilbert held that it was permissible to dismiss an action brought in aDistrict Court in New York by a Virginia plaintiff against a defendantdoing business in Virginia for a fire that occurred in Virginia. Such adismissal would be improper today because of the federal venue transferstatute, 28 U. S. C. $ 1404(a): "For the convenience of parties and witnesses,in the interest of justice, a district court may transfer any civil action toany other district or division where it might have been brought." By thisstatute, "[d]istrict courts were given more discretion to transfer . . . thanthey had to dismiss on grounds of forum non conveniens." Piper Aircraft Co. v. Reyno, 454 U. S. 235, 253 (1981). As a consequence, the federaldoctrine of forum non conveniens has continuing application only in caseswhere the alternative forum is abroad.510us2$23K 06-19-97 22:51:48 PAGES OPINPGT450 AMERICAN DREDGING CO. v. MILLEROpinion of the CourtBut the doctrine's application has not been unique to admi-ralty. When the Court held, in Gilbert, supra, that forumnon conveniens applied to all federal diversity cases, JusticeBlack's dissent argued that the doctrine had been applied inmaritime cases "[f]or reasons peculiar to the special prob-lems of admiralty."Id., at 513. The Court disagreed, recit-ing a long history of valid application of the doctrine by statecourts, both at law and in equity. Id., at 504-505, and n. 4.It observed that the problem of plaintiffs' misusing venue tothe inconvenience of defendants "is a very old one affectingthe administration of the courts as well as the rights of litigants, and both in England and in this country the commonlaw worked out techniques and criteria for dealing with it."Id., at 507. Our most recent opinion dealing with forumnon conveniens, Piper Aircraft Co. v. Reyno, 454 U. S. 235(1981), recognized that the doctrine "originated in Scotland,and became part of the common law of many States," id.,at 248, n. 13 (citation omitted), and treated the forum nonconveniens analysis of Canada Malting Co. v. Paterson S. S.,Ltd., 285 U. S. 413 (1932), an admiralty case, as binding prec-edent in the nonadmiralty context.In sum, the doctrine of forum non conveniens neitheroriginated in admiralty nor has exclusive application there.To the contrary, it is and has long been a doctrine of generalapplication. Louisiana's refusal to apply forum non conveniens does not, therefore, work "material prejudice to [a]characteristic featur[e] of the general maritime law."South-ern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, 244 U. S., at 216.BPetitioner correctly points out that the decision here underreview produces disuniformity. As the Fifth Circuit notedin Ikospentakis v. Thalassic S. S. Agency, 915 F. 2d 176, 179(1990), maritime defendants "have access to a forum nonconveniens defense in federal court that is not presently rec-ognized in Louisiana state courts." We must therefore con510us2$23K 06-19-97 22:51:48 PAGES OPINPGT451Cite as: 510 U. S. 443 (1994)Opinion of the Courtsider whether Louisiana's rule "interferes with the properharmony and uniformity" of maritime law,Southern PacificCo. v. Jensen, supra, at 216.InThe Lottawanna, 21 Wall. 558, 575 (1875), Justice Bradley, writing for the Court, said of the Article III provisionextending federal judicial power "to all Cases of admiraltyand maritime Jurisdiction":"One thing . . . is unquestionable; the Constitutionmust have referred to a system of law coextensive with,and operating uniformly in, the whole country. It certainly could not have been the intention to place therules and limits of maritime law under the disposal andregulation of the several States, as that would have defeated the uniformity and consistency at which the Con-stitution aimed on all subjects of a commercial characteraffecting the intercourse of the States with each otheror with foreign states."By reason of this principle, we disallowed in Jensen the ap-plication of state workers' compensation statutes to injuriescovered by the admiralty jurisdiction. Later, in Knickerbocker Ice Co. v. Stewart, 253 U. S. 149, 163-164 (1920), weheld that not even Congress itself could permit such applica-tion and thereby sanction destruction of the constitutionallyprescribed uniformity. We have also relied on the uniformity principle to hold that a State may not require that a mari-time contract be in writing where admiralty law regards oralcontracts as valid, Kossick v. United Fruit Co., 365 U. S.731 (1961).The requirement of uniformity is not, however, absolute.As Jensen itself recognized: "[I]t would be difficult, if notimpossible, to define with exactness just how far the generalmaritime law may be changed, modified, or affected by statelegislation. That this may be done to some extent cannot bedenied." 244 U. S., at 216. A later case describes to whatbreadth this "some extent" extends:510us2$23K 06-19-97 22:51:48 PAGES OPINPGT452 AMERICAN DREDGING CO. v. MILLEROpinion of the Court"It is true that state law must yield to the needs of auniform federal maritime law when this Court finds inroads on a harmonious system[,] [b]ut this limitation stillleaves the States a wide scope. State-created liens areenforced in admiralty. State remedies for wrongfuldeath and state statutes providing for the survival ofactions . . . have been upheld when applied to maritimecauses of action. . . . State rules for the partition andsale of ships, state laws governing the specific performance of arbitration agreements, state laws regulatingthe effect of a breach of warranty under contracts ofmaritime insurance--all these laws and others havebeen accepted as rules of decision in admiralty cases,even, at times, when they conflicted with a rule of maritime law which did not require uniformity." Romerov. International Terminal Operating Co., 358 U. S. 354,373-374 (1959) (footnotes omitted).It would be idle to pretend that the line separating permissible from impermissible state regulation is readily discernible in our admiralty jurisprudence, or indeed is evenentirely consistent within our admiralty jurisprudence.Compare Kossick, supra (state law cannot require provisionof maritime contract to be in writing), with Wilburn BoatCo. v. Fireman's Fund Ins. Co., 348 U. S. 310 (1955) (statelaw can determine effect of breach of warranty in marineinsurance policy).3 Happily, it is unnecessary to wrestle3 Whatever might be the unifying theme of this aspect of our admiraltyjurisprudence, it assuredly is not what the dissent takes it to be, namely,the principle that the States may not impair maritime commerce, see post,at 463-464, 467. In Fireman's Fund, for example, we did not inquirewhether the breach-of-warranty rule Oklahoma imposed would help orharm maritime commerce, but simply whether the State had power toregulate the matter. The no-harm-to-commerce theme that the dissentplays is of course familiar to the ear--not from our admiralty repertoire,however, but from our "negative Commerce Clause" jurisprudence, see510us2$23K 06-19-97 22:51:48 PAGES OPINPGT453Cite as: 510 U. S. 443 (1994)Opinion of the Courtwith that difficulty today. Wherever the boundaries of per-missible state regulation may lie, they do not invalidate staterejection of forum non conveniens, which is in two respectsquite dissimilar from any other matter that our opinions haveheld to be governed by federal admiralty law: it is proceduralrather than substantive, and it is most unlikely to produceuniform results.As to the former point: At bottom, the doctrine offorumnon conveniens is nothing more or less than a superveningvenue provision, permitting displacement of the ordinaryrules of venue when, in light of certain conditions, the trialcourt thinks that jurisdiction ought to be declined. Butvenue is a matter that goes to process rather than substantive rights--determining which among various competentcourts will decide the case. Uniformity of process (beyondthe rudimentary elements of procedural fairness) is as-suredly not what the law of admiralty seeks to achieve, sinceit is supposed to apply in all the courts of the world. Justas state courts, in deciding admiralty cases, are not boundby the venue requirements set forth for federal courts in theUnited States Code, so also they are not bound by the federalcommon-law venue rule (so to speak) of forum non conve-niens. Because the doctrine is one of procedure rather thansubstance, petitioner is wrong to claim support from our de-cision in Pope & Talbot, Inc. v. Hawn, 346 U. S. 406 (1953),which held that Pennsylvania courts must apply the admiBendix Autolite Corp. v. Midwesco Enterprises, Inc., 486 U. S. 888, 891(1988). No Commerce Clause challenge is presented in this case.Similarly misdirected is the dissent's complaint that Article 123 of theLouisiana Code of Civil Procedure unfairly discriminates against maritimedefendants because it permits application of forum non conveniens in nonmaritime cases, see post, at 462-463. The only issue raised and arguedin this appeal, and the only issue we decide, is whether state courts mustapply the federal rule of forum non conveniens in maritime actions.Whether they may accord discriminatory treatment to maritime actionsby applying a state forum non conveniens rule in all except maritimecases is a question not remotely before us.510us2$23K 06-19-97 22:51:48 PAGES OPINPGT454 AMERICAN DREDGING CO. v. MILLEROpinion of the Courtralty rule that contributory negligence is no bar to recovery.The other case petitioner relies on, Garrett v. MooreMcCormack Co., 317 U. S. 239, 248-249 (1942), held that thetraditional maritime rule placing the burden of proving thevalidity of a release upon the defendant pre-empts state lawplacing the burden of proving invalidity upon the plaintiff.In earlier times, burden of proof was regarded as "procedural" for choice-of-law purposes such as the one before ushere, see, e. g., Levy v. Steiger, 233 Mass. 600, 124 N. E. 477(1919); Restatement of Conflict of Laws $ 595 (1934). Formany years, however, it has been viewed as a matter of substance, see Cities Service Oil Co. v. Dunlap, 308 U. S. 208,212 (1939)--which is unquestionably the view that the Courttook in Garrett, stating that the right of the plaintiff to befree of the burden of proof "inhered in his cause of action,""was a part of the very substance of his claim and cannot beconsidered a mere incident of a form of procedure." 317U. S., at 249. Unlike burden of proof (which is a sort of default rule of liability) and affirmative defenses such as contributory negligence (which eliminate liability), forum nonconveniens does not bear upon the substantive right to recover, and is not a rule upon which maritime actors rely inmaking decisions about primary conduct--how to managetheir business and what precautions to take.44 It is because forum non conveniens is not a substantive right of theparties, but a procedural rule of the forum, that the dissent is wrong tosay our decision will cause federal-court forum non conveniens determinations in admiralty cases to be driven, henceforth, by state law--i. e.,that the federal court in a State with the Louisiana rule may as well acceptjurisdiction, since otherwise the state court will. See post, at 468-469.That is no more true of forum non conveniens than it is of venue. Underboth doctrines, the object of the dimissal is achieved whether or not theparty can then repair to a state court in the same location. Federal courtswill continue to invoke forum non conveniens to decline jurisdiction inappropriate cases, whether or not the State in which they sit chooses toburden its judiciary with litigation better handled elsewhere.510us2$23K 06-19-97 22:51:48 PAGES OPINPGT455Cite as: 510 U. S. 443 (1994)Opinion of the CourtBut to tell the truth, forum non conveniens cannot reallybe relied upon in making decisions about secondary conduct--in deciding, for example, where to sue or where oneis subject to being sued. The discretionary nature of thedoctrine, combined with the multifariousness of the factorsrelevant to its application, see the quotation fromGilbert,supra, at 448-449, make uniformity and predictability of outcome almost impossible. "The forum non conveniens de-termination," we have said, "is committed to the sound discretion of the trial court. It may be reversed only whenthere has been a clear abuse of discretion; where the courthas considered all relevant public and private interest fac-tors, and where its balancing of these factors is reasonable,its decision deserves substantial deference." Piper AircraftCo. v. Reyno, 454 U. S., at 257. We have emphasized that" `[e]ach case turns on its facts' " and have repeatedly rejected the use of per se rules in applying the doctrine. Id.,at 249; Koster v. (American) Lumbermens Mut. CasualtyCo., 330 U. S., at 527. In such a regime, one can rarely counton the fact that jurisdiction will be declined.CWhat we have concluded from our analysis of admiraltylaw in general is strongly confirmed by examination of federal legislation. While there is an established and continu-ing tradition of federal common lawmaking in admiralty, thatlaw is to be developed, insofar as possible, to harmonize withthe enactments of Congress in the field. Foremost amongthose enactments in the field of maritime torts is the JonesAct, 46 U. S. C. App. $ 688.That legislation, which establishes a uniform federal lawthat state as well as federal courts must apply to the determination of employer liability to seamen, Garrett, supra, at244, incorporates by reference "all statutes of the UnitedStates modifying or extending the common-law right or rem-edy in cases of personal injury to railway employees." 46510us2$23K 06-19-97 22:51:48 PAGES OPINPGT456 AMERICAN DREDGING CO. v. MILLEROpinion of the CourtU. S. C. App. $ 688(a). Accordingly, we have held that theJones Act adopts "the entire judicially developed doctrineof liability" under the Federal Employers' Liability Act(FELA), 35 Stat. 65, as amended, 45 U. S. C. $ 51et seq. Kernan v. American Dredging Co., 355 U. S. 426, 439 (1958).More particularly, we have held that the Jones Act adoptsthe "uniformity requirement" of the FELA, requiring statecourts to apply a uniform federal law. Garrett, supra, at244. And--to come to the point of this excursus--despitethat uniformity requirement we held in Missouri ex rel.Southern R. Co. v. Mayfield, 340 U. S. 1, 5 (1950), that a statecourt presiding over an action pursuant to the FELA"should be freed to decide the availability of the principle offorum non conveniens in these suits according to its ownlocal law." We declared forum non conveniens to be a mat-ter of "local policy,"id., at 4, a proposition well substantiatedby the local nature of the "public factors" relevant to theforum non conveniens determination. See Reyno, supra,at 241, and n. 6 (quoting Gilbert, 330 U. S., at 509).We think it evident that the rule whichMayfield announced for the FELA applies as well to the Jones Act,which in turn supports the view that maritime commerce ingeneral does not require a uniform rule of forum non conveniens. Amicus Maritime Law Association of the UnitedStates argues that "whether or not it is appropriate to analogize from FELA to the Jones Act, Mayfield cannot save theresult below because the Louisiana statute abolishes theforum non conveniens doctrine in all maritime cases, notjust those arising under the Jones Act." Brief for MaritimeLaw Association as Amicus Curiae 16. It is true enoughthat the Mayfield rule does not operate ex proprio vigorebeyond the field of the FELA and (by incorporation) theJones Act. But harmonization of general admiralty lawwith congressional enactments would have little meaning ifwe were to hold that, though forum non conveniens is alocal matter for purposes of the Jones Act, it is neverthelessa matter of global concern requiring uniformity under gen510us2$23K 06-19-97 22:51:48 PAGES OPINPGT457Cite as: 510 U. S. 443 (1994)Souter, J., concurringeral maritime law. That is especially so in light of our rec-ognition in McAllister v. Magnolia Petroleum Co., 357 U. S.,at 224-225, that, for practical reasons, a seaman will almostalways combine in a single action claims for relief under theJones Act and general maritime law. It would produce dis-sonance rather than harmony to hold that his claims for unseaworthiness and maintenance and cure, but not his JonesAct claim, could be dismissed forforum non conveniens.The Jones Act's treatment of venue lends further supportto our conclusion. In Bainbridge v. Merchants & MinersTransp. Co., 287 U. S. 278, 280-281 (1932), we held that although 46 U. S. C. App. $ 688(a) contains a venue provision,"venue [in Jones Act cases brought in state court] should . . .[be] determined by the trial court in accordance with the lawof the state." The implication of that holding is that venueunder the Jones Act is a matter of judicial housekeeping thathas been prescribed only for the federal courts. We notedearlier that forum non conveniens is a sort of superveningvenue rule--and here again, what is true for venue underthe Jones Act should ordinarily be true under maritime lawin general. What we have prescribed for the federal courtswith regard to forum non conveniens is not applicable tothe States.* * *Amicus the Solicitor General has urged that we limit ourholding, thatforum non conveniens is not part of the uni-form law of admiralty, to cases involving domestic entities.We think it unnecessary to do that. Since the parties to thissuit are domestic entities it is quite impossible for our holding to be any broader.The judgment of the Supreme Court of Louisiana is
