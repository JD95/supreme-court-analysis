This case presents the question whether the claim-preclusive effect of a federal judgment dismissing a diversity action on statute-of-limitations grounds is determinedby the law of the State in which the federal court sits.IPetitioner filed a complaint against respondent in Cali-fornia state court, alleging inducement of breach of contractand various business torts. Respondent removed the caseto the United States District Court for the Central Districtof California on the basis of diversity of citizenship, see 28U. S. C. $$ 1332, 1441 (1994 ed. and Supp. IV), and successfully moved to dismiss petitioner's claims as barred by Cali-fornia's 2-year statute of limitations. In its order of dismissal, the District Court, adopting language suggested byrespondent, dismissed petitioner's claims "in [their] entiretyon the merits and with prejudice." App. to Pet. for Cert.59a. Without contesting the District Court's designation ofits dismissal as "on the merits," petitioner appealed to theCourt of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which affirmed theDistrict Court's order. 168 F. 3d 501 (1999) (table). Peti-tioner also brought suit against respondent in the State Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland, alleging the samecauses of action, which were not time barred under Maryland's 3-year statute of limitations. Respondent sought in-junctive relief against this action from the California federalcourt under the All Writs Act, 28 U. S.

Lockheed Martin Corp., 988F. Supp. 913, 914 (1997)). The California federal court denied the relief requested, and the Maryland federal court re-manded the case to state court because the federal questionarose only by way of defense, ibid. Following a hearing, theMaryland state court granted respondent's motion to dismisson the ground of res judicata. Petitioner then returned tothe California federal court and the Ninth Circuit, unsuccessfully moving both courts to amend the former's earlier orderso as to indicate that the dismissal was not "on the merits."Petitioner also appealed the Maryland trial court's order ofdismissal to the Maryland Court of Special Appeals. TheCourt of Special Appeals affirmed, holding that, regardlessof whether California would have accorded claim-preclusiveeffect to a statute-of-limitations dismissal by one of its owncourts, the dismissal by the California federal court barredthe complaint filed in Maryland, since the res judicata effectof federal diversity judgments is prescribed by federal law,under which the earlier dismissal was on the merits andclaim preclusive. 128 Md. App. 39, 736 A. 2d 1104 (1999).After the Maryland Court of Appeals declined to review thecase, we granted certiorari. 530 U. S. 1260 (2000).IIPetitioner contends that the outcome of this case is con-trolled by Dupasseur v. Rochereau, 21 Wall. 130, 135 (1875),which held that the res judicata effect of a federal diver-sity judgment "is such as would belong to judgments ofthe State courts rendered under similar circumstances," andmay not be accorded any "higher sanctity or effect." Since,petitioner argues, the dismissal of an action on statute-of-limitations grounds by a California state court would not beclaim preclusive, it follows that the similar dismissal of thisdiversity action by the California federal court cannot be531US2 Unit: $U26 [05-24-01 09:04:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN501Cite as: 531 U. S. 497 (2001)Opinion of the Courtclaim preclusive. While we agree that this would be theresult demanded byDupasseur, the case is not dispositivebecause it was decided under the Conformity Act of 1872,17 Stat. 196, which required federal courts to apply the procedural law of the forum State in nonequity cases. Thatarguably affected the outcome of the case. SeeDupasseur,supra, at 135. See also Restatement (Second) of Judgments$ 87, Comment a, p. 315 (1980) (hereinafter Restatement)("Since procedural law largely determines the matters thatmay be adjudicated in an action, state law had to be consid-ered in ascertaining the effect of a federal judgment").Respondent, for its part, contends that the outcome of thiscase is controlled by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(b),which provides as follows:"Involuntary Dismissal: Effect Thereof. For failure ofthe plaintiff to prosecute or to comply with these rulesor any order of court, a defendant may move for dismissal of an action or of any claim against the defendant.Unless the court in its order for dismissal otherwisespecifies, a dismissal under this subdivision and anydismissal not provided for in this rule, other than adismissal for lack of jurisdiction, for improper venue, orfor failure to join a party under Rule 19, operates as anadjudication upon the merits."Since the dismissal here did not "otherwise specif[y]" (indeed, it specifically stated that it was "on the merits"), anddid not pertain to the excepted subjects of jurisdiction,venue, or joinder, it follows, respondent contends, that thedismissal "is entitled to claim preclusive effect." Brief forRespondent 3-4.Implicit in this reasoning is the unstated minor premisethat all judgments denominated "on the merits" are entitledto claim-preclusive effect. That premise is not necessarilyvalid. The original connotation of an "on the merits" adjudication is one that actually "pass[es] directly on the substance531US2 Unit: $U26 [05-24-01 09:04:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN502 SEMTEK INT'L INC. v. LOCKHEED MARTIN CORP.Opinion of the Courtof [a particular] claim" before the court. Restatement $ 19,Commenta, at 161. That connotation remains common toevery jurisdiction of which we are aware. See ibid. ("Theprototyp[ical] [ judgment on the merits is] one in which themerits of [a party's] claim are in fact adjudicated [for or]against the [party] after trial of the substantive issues").And it is, we think, the meaning intended in those manystatements to the effect that a judgment "on the merits"triggers the doctrine of res judicata or claim preclusion.See, e. g., Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, 439 U. S. 322, 326,n. 5 (1979) ("Under the doctrine of res judicata, a judgmenton the merits in a prior suit bars a second suit involvingthe same parties or their privies based on the same causeof action"); Goddard v. Security Title Ins. & Guarantee Co.,14 Cal. 2d 47, 51, 92 P. 2d 804, 806 (1939) ("[A] final judgment, rendered upon the merits by a court having jurisdiction of the cause . . . is a complete bar to a new suit between[the parties or their privies] on the same cause of action"(internal quotation marks and citations omitted)).But over the years the meaning of the term "judgment onthe merits" "has gradually undergone change," R. Marcus,M. Redish, & E. Sherman, Civil Procedure: A Modern Approach 1140-1141 (3d ed. 2000), and it has come to be appliedto some judgments (such as the one involved here) that donot pass upon the substantive merits of a claim and hencedo not (in many jurisdictions) entail claim-preclusive effect.Compare, e. g., Western Coal & Mining Co. v. Jones, 27 Cal.2d 819, 826, 167 P. 2d 719, 724 (1946), and Koch v. RodlinEnterprises, Inc., 223 Cal. App. 3d 1591, 1596, 273 Cal. Rptr.438, 441 (1990), with Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc., 514U. S. 211, 228 (1995) (statute of limitations); Goddard, supra,at 50-51, 92 P. 2d, at 806-807, and Allston v. IncorporatedVillage of Rockville Centre, 25 App. Div. 2d 545, 546, 267N. Y. S. 2d 564, 565-566 (1966), with Federated DepartmentStores, Inc. v. Moitie, 452 U. S. 394, 399, n. 3 (1981) (demurreror failure to state a claim). See also Restatement $ 19, Com531US2 Unit: $U26 [05-24-01 09:04:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN503Cite as: 531 U. S. 497 (2001)Opinion of the Courtment a and Reporter's Note; 18 C. Wright, A. Miller, &E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure $ 4439, pp. 355-358 (1981) (hereinafter Wright & Miller). That is why theRestatement of Judgments has abandoned the use of theterm--"because of its possibly misleading connotations," Restatement $ 19, Comment a, at 161.In short, it is no longer true that a judgment "on themerits" is necessarily a judgment entitled to claim-preclusiveeffect; and there are a number of reasons for believing thatthe phrase "adjudication upon the merits" does not bearthat meaning in Rule 41(b). To begin with, Rule 41(b) setsforth nothing more than a default rule for determiningthe import of a dismissal (a dismissal is "upon the merits,"with the three stated exceptions, unless the court "otherwise specifies"). This would be a highly peculiar context inwhich to announce a federally prescribed rule on the complexquestion of claim preclusion, saying in effect, "All federaldismissals (with three specified exceptions) preclude suitelsewhere, unless the court otherwise specifies."And even apart from the purely default character of Rule41(b), it would be peculiar to find a rule governing the effectthat must be accorded federal judgments by other courtsensconced in rules governing the internal procedures of therendering court itself. Indeed, such a rule would arguablyviolate the jurisdictional limitation of the Rules EnablingAct: that the Rules "shall not abridge, enlarge or modify anysubstantive right," 28 U. S. C. $ 2072(b). Cf. Ortiz v. Fibreboard Corp., 527 U. S. 815, 842 (1999) (adopting a "limitingconstruction" of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(1)(B)in order to "minimiz[e] potential conflict with the Rules Enabling Act, and [to] avoi[d] serious constitutional concerns").In the present case, for example, if California law left petitioner free to sue on this claim in Maryland even after theCalifornia statute of limitations had expired, the federalcourt's extinguishment of that right (through Rule 41(b)'s531US2 Unit: $U26 [05-24-01 09:04:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN504 SEMTEK INT'L INC. v. LOCKHEED MARTIN CORP.Opinion of the Courtmandated claim-preclusive effect of its judgment) wouldseem to violate this limitation.Moreover, as so interpreted, the Rule would in many casesviolate the federalism principle of Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins,304 U. S. 64, 78-80 (1938), by engendering " `substantial'variations [in outcomes] between state and federal litigation"which would "[l]ikely . . . influence the choice of a forum,"Hanna v. Plumer, 380 U. S. 460, 467-468 (1965). See alsoGuaranty Trust Co. v. York, 326 U. S. 99, 108-110 (1945).Cf. Walker v. Armco Steel Corp., 446 U. S. 740, 748-753(1980). With regard to the claim-preclusion issue involvedin the present case, for example, the traditional rule is thatexpiration of the applicable statute of limitations merelybars the remedy and does not extinguish the substantiveright, so that dismissal on that ground does not have claimpreclusive effect in other jurisdictions with longer, unexpiredlimitations periods. See Restatement (Second) of Conflictof Laws $$ 142(2), 143 (1969); Restatement of Judgments $ 49,Comment a (1942). Out-of-state defendants sued on staleclaims in California and in other States adhering to thistraditional rule would systematically remove state-law suitsbrought against them to federal court--where, unless otherwise specified, a statute-of-limitations dismissal would barsuit everywhere.1Finally, if Rule 41(b) did mean what respondent suggests,we would surely have relied upon it in our cases recognizingthe claim-preclusive effect of federal judgments in federalquestion cases. Yet for over half a century since the pro1 Rule 41(b), interpreted as a preclusion-establishing rule, would nothave the two effects described in the preceding paragraphs--arguableviolation of the Rules Enabling Act and incompatibility with Erie R. Co.v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64 (1938)--if the court's failure to specify an otherthan-on-the-merits dismissal were subject to reversal on appeal wheneverit would alter the rule of claim preclusion applied by the State in whichthe federal court sits. No one suggests that this is the rule, and we areaware of no case that applies it.531US2 Unit: $U26 [05-24-01 09:04:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN505Cite as: 531 U. S. 497 (2001)Opinion of the Courtmulgation of Rule 41(b), we have not once done so. See,e. g., Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U. S. 477, 488-489, n. 9 (1994);Federated Department Stores, Inc. v. Moitie, supra, at 398;Blonder-Tongue Laboratories, Inc. v. University of Ill.Foundation, 402 U. S. 313, 324, n. 12 (1971).We think the key to a more reasonable interpretation ofthe meaning of "operates as an adjudication upon the merits"in Rule 41(b) is to be found in Rule 41(a), which, in discussingthe effect of voluntary dismissal by the plaintiff, makes clearthat an "adjudication upon the merits" is the opposite of a"dismissal without prejudice":"Unless otherwise stated in the notice of dismissal orstipulation, the dismissal is without prejudice, exceptthat a notice of dismissal operates as an adjudicationupon the merits when filed by a plaintiff who has oncedismissed in any court of the United States or of anystate an action based on or including the same claim."See also 18 Wright & Miller $ 4435, at 329, n. 4 ("Both partsof Rule 41 . . . use the phrase `without prejudice' as a contrastto adjudication on the merits"); 9id., $ 2373, at 396, n. 4(" `[W]ith prejudice' is an acceptable form of shorthand for`an adjudication upon the merits' "). See also Goddard, 14Cal. 2d, at 54, 92 P. 2d, at 808 (stating that a dismissal "withprejudice" evinces "[t]he intention of the court to make[the dismissal] on the merits"). The primary meaning of"dismissal without prejudice," we think, is dismissal withoutbarring the plaintiff from returning later, to the same court,with the same underlying claim. That will also ordinarily(though not always) have the consequence of not barring theclaim from other courts, but its primary meaning relates tothe dismissing court itself. Thus, Black's Law Dictionary(7th ed. 1999) defines "dismissed without prejudice" as "removed from the court's docket in such a way that the plaintiffmay refile the same suit on the same claim," id., at 482, anddefines "dismissal without prejudice" as "[a] dismissal that531US2 Unit: $U26 [05-24-01 09:04:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN506 SEMTEK INT'L INC. v. LOCKHEED MARTIN CORP.Opinion of the Courtdoes not bar the plaintiff from refiling the lawsuit within theapplicable limitations period," ibid.We think, then, that the effect of the "adjudication uponthe merits" default provision of Rule 41(b)--and, presumably, of the explicit order in the present case that used thelanguage of that default provision--is simply that, unlike adismissal "without prejudice," the dismissal in the presentcase barred refiling of the same claim in the United StatesDistrict Court for the Central District of California. Thatis undoubtedly a necessary condition, but it is not a sufficientone, for claim-preclusive effect in other courts.2IIIHaving concluded that the claim-preclusive effect, inMaryland, of this California federal diversity judgment isdictated neither by Dupasseur v. Rochereau, as petitionercontends, nor by Rule 41(b), as respondent contends, weturn to consideration of what determines the issue. Neitherthe Full Faith and Credit Clause, U. S. Const., Art. IV, $ 1,3nor the full faith and credit statute, 28 U. S. C. $ 1738,4 ad2 We do not decide whether, in a diversity case, a federal court's "dismissal upon the merits" (in the sense we have described), under circumstances where a state court would decree only a "dismissal without prejudice," abridges a "substantive right" and thus exceeds the authorizationof the Rules Enabling Act. We think the situation will present itself morerarely than would the arguable violation of the Act that would ensue frominterpreting Rule 41(b) as a rule of claim preclusion; and if it is a violation,can be more easily dealt with on direct appeal.3 Article IV, $ 1, provides as follows:"Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts,Records, and judicial Proceedings of every other State. And the Congress may by general Laws prescribe the Manner in which such Acts,Records and Proceedings shall be proved, and the Effect thereof."4 Title 28 U. S. C. $ 1738 provides in relevant part as follows:"The records and judicial proceedings of any court of any . . . State,Territory or Possession . . . shall have the same full faith and credit inevery court within the United States and its Territories and Possessionsas they have by law or usage in the courts of such State, Territory orPossession from which they are taken."531US2 Unit: $U26 [05-24-01 09:04:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN507Cite as: 531 U. S. 497 (2001)Opinion of the Courtdresses the question. By their terms they govern the ef-fects to be given only to state-court judgments (and, in thecase of the statute, to judgments by courts of territoriesand possessions). And no other federal textual provision,neither of the Constitution nor of any statute, addresses theclaim-preclusive effect of a judgment in a federal diversityaction.It is also true, however, that no federal textual provisionaddresses the claim-preclusive effect of a federal-court judg-ment in a federal-question case, yet we have long held thatStates cannot give those judgments merely whatever effectthey would give their own judgments, but must accord themthe effect that this Court prescribes. See Stoll v. Gottlieb,305 U. S. 165, 171-172 (1938);Gunter v. Atlantic Coast LineR. Co., 200 U. S. 273, 290-291 (1906); Deposit Bank v. Frankfort, 191 U. S. 499, 514-515 (1903). The reasoning of thatline of cases suggests, moreover, that even when States areallowed to give federal judgments (notably, judgments indiversity cases) no more than the effect accorded to statejudgments, that disposition is by direction of this Court,which has the last word on the claim-preclusive effect ofallfederal judgments:"It is true that for some purposes and within certainlimits it is only required that the judgments of thecourts of the United States shall be given the same forceand effect as are given the judgments of the courts ofthe States wherein they are rendered; but it is equallytrue that whether a Federal judgment has been givendue force and effect in the state court is a Federal ques-tion reviewable by this court, which will determine foritself whether such judgment has been given due weightor otherwise. . . ."When is the state court obliged to give to Federaljudgments only the force and effect it gives to statecourt judgments within its own jurisdiction? Suchcases are distinctly pointed out in the opinion of Mr. Jus531US2 Unit: $U26 [05-24-01 09:04:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN508 SEMTEK INT'L INC. v. LOCKHEED MARTIN CORP.Opinion of the Courttice Bradley in Dupasseur v. Rochereau [which statedthat the case was a diversity case, applying state lawunder state procedure]." Ibid.In other words, in Dupasseur the State was allowed (indeed,required) to give a federal diversity judgment no more effectthan it would accord one of its own judgments only becausereference to state law wasthe federal rule that this Courtdeemed appropriate. In short, federal common law governsthe claim-preclusive effect of a dismissal by a federal courtsitting in diversity. See generally R. Fallon, D. Meltzer, &D. Shapiro, Hart and Wechsler's The Federal Courts andthe Federal System 1473 (4th ed. 1996); Degnan, FederalizedRes Judicata, 85 Yale L. J. 741 (1976).It is left to us, then, to determine the appropriate federalrule. And despite the sea change that has occurred in thebackground law sinceDupasseur was decided--not only re-peal of the Conformity Act but also the watershed decisionof this Court in Erie--we think the result decreed by Du-passeur continues to be correct for diversity cases. Sincestate, rather than federal, substantive law is at issue thereis no need for a uniform federal rule. And indeed, nationwide uniformity in the substance of the matter is betterserved by having the same claim-preclusive rule (the staterule) apply whether the dismissal has been ordered by astate or a federal court. This is, it seems to us, a classiccase for adopting, as the federally prescribed rule of deci-sion, the law that would be applied by state courts in theState in which the federal diversity court sits. See Gasperini v. Center for Humanities, Inc., 518 U. S. 415, 429-431(1996); Walker v. Armco Steel Corp., 446 U. S., at 752-753;Bernhardt v. Polygraphic Co. of America, 350 U. S. 198, 202-205 (1956); Palmer v. Hoffman, 318 U. S. 109, 117 (1943);Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Elec. Mfg. Co., 313 U. S. 487, 496 (1941);Cities Service Oil Co. v. Dunlap, 308 U. S. 208, 212 (1939).As we have alluded to above, any other rule would producethe sort of "forum-shopping . . . and . . . inequitable ad531US2 Unit: $U26 [05-24-01 09:04:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN509Cite as: 531 U. S. 497 (2001)Opinion of the Courtministration of the laws" that Erie seeks to avoid, Hanna,380 U. S., at 468, since filing in, or removing to, federal courtwould be encouraged by the divergent effects that thelitigants would anticipate from likely grounds of dismissal.See Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, 326 U. S., at 109-110.This federal reference to state law will not obtain, ofcourse, in situations in which the state law is incompati-ble with federal interests. If, for example, state law didnot accord claim-preclusive effect to dismissals for willfulviolation of discovery orders, federal courts' interest in theintegrity of their own processes might justify a contraryfederal rule. No such conflict with potential federal interests exists in the present case. Dismissal of this state causeof action was decreed by the California federal court onlybecause the California statute of limitations so required; andthere is no conceivable federal interest in giving that timebar more effect in other courts than the California courtsthemselves would impose.* * *Because the claim-preclusive effect of the California fed-eral court's dismissal "upon the merits" of petitioner's actionon statute-of-limitations grounds is governed by a federalrule that in turn incorporates California's law of claim preclusion (the content of which we do not pass upon today),the Maryland Court of Special Appeals erred in holding thatthe dismissal necessarily precluded the bringing of this ac-tion in the Maryland courts. The judgment is reversed, andthe case remanded for further proceedings not inconsistentwith this opinion.
