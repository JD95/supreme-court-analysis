GAUDINOpinion of the CourtHousing Administration (FHA), an agency within the De-partment of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Respondent would purchase rental housing, renovate it, obtainan inflated appraisal, and sell it to a "straw buyer" (a friendor relative), for whom respondent would arrange an FHAinsured mortgage loan. Then, as prearranged, respondentwould repurchase the property (at a small profit to the strawbuyer) and assume the mortgage loan. Twenty-nine ofthese ventures went into default.Respondent was charged by federal indictment with,among other things, multiple counts of making false statements on federal loan documents in violation of 18 U. S. C.$ 1001. Two of these counts charged that respondent hadmade false statements on HUD/FHA form 92800-5 by knowingly inflating the appraised value of the mortgaged property. The other false-statement counts charged that respondent had made misrepresentations on HUD/FHA formHUD-1, the settlement form used in closing the sales of theproperties. Line 303 of this form requires disclosure of theclosing costs to be paid or received by the borrower/ buyerand the seller. The forms executed by respondent showedthat the buyer was to pay some of the closing costs, whereasin fact he, the seller, had arranged to pay all of them. Toprove the materiality of these false statements, the Government offered the testimony of several persons charged withadministering FHA/HUD programs, who explained why therequested information was important.At the close of the evidence, the United States DistrictCourt for the District of Montana instructed the jury that,to convict respondent, the Government was required toprove, inter alia, that the alleged false statements were material to the activities and decisions of HUD. But, the courtfurther instructed, "[t]he issue of materiality . . . is not submitted to you for your decision but rather is a matter for thedecision of the court. You are instructed that the statements charged in the indictment are material statements."515us2$81k 08-25-98 19:26:11 PAGES OPINPGT509Cite as: 515 U. S. 506 (1995)Opinion of the CourtApp. 24, 29. The jury convicted respondent of the $ 1001charges.A panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit re-versed these convictions because Circuit precedent dictatedthat materiality in a $ 1001 prosecution be decided by thejury. 997 F. 2d 1267 (1993). On rehearing en banc, theCourt of Appeals stood by this precedent. It held that tak-ing the question of materiality from the jury denied respondent a right guaranteed by the Fifth and Sixth Amendmentsto the United States Constitution. 28 F. 3d 943 (1994). Wegranted certiorari. 513 U. S. 1071 (1995).IISection 1001 of Title 18 provides:"Whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of anydepartment or agency of the United States knowinglyand willfully falsifies, conceals or covers up by any trick,scheme, or device a material fact, or makes any false,fictitious or fraudulent statements or representations, ormakes or uses any false writing or document knowingthe same to contain any false, fictitious or fraudulentstatement or entry, shall be fined not more than $10,000or imprisoned not more than five years, or both."It is uncontested that conviction under this provision re-quires that the statements be "material" to the Governmentinquiry, and that "materiality" is an element of the offensethat the Government must prove. The parties also agree onthe definition of "materiality": The statement must have "anatural tendency to influence, or [be] capable of influencing,the decision of the decisionmaking body to which it was ad-dressed."Kungys v. United States, 485 U. S. 759, 770 (1988)(internal quotation marks omitted). The question for ourresolution is whether respondent was entitled to have thiselement of the crime determined by the jury.The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitutionguarantees that no one will be deprived of liberty without515us2$81k 08-25-98 19:26:11 PAGES OPINPGT510 UNITED STATES v. GAUDINOpinion of the Court"due process of law"; and the Sixth, that "[i]n all criminalprosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedyand public trial, by an impartial jury." We have held thatthese provisions require criminal convictions to rest upon ajury determination that the defendant is guilty of every ele-ment of the crime with which he is charged, beyond a reasonable doubt.1 Sullivan v. Louisiana, 508 U. S. 275, 277-278(1993). The right to have a jury make the ultimate determination of guilt has an impressive pedigree. Blackstone de-scribed "trial by jury" as requiring that "the truth of everyaccusation, whether preferred in the shape of indictment,information, or appeal, should afterwards be confirmed bythe unanimous suffrage of twelve of [the defendant's] equalsand neighbors . . . ." 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on theLaws of England 343 (1769) (emphasis added). Justice Storywrote that the "trial by jury" guaranteed by the Constitu-tion was "generally understood to mean . . . a trial by a juryof twelve men, impartially selected, who must unanimouslyconcur in the guilt of the accused before a legal convictioncan be had." 2 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitutionof the United States 541, n. 2 (4th ed. 1873) (emphasis addedand deleted).2 This right was designed "to guard against a1 The "beyond a reasonable doubt" point is not directly at issue in thepresent case, since it is unclear what standard of proof the District Courtapplied in making its determination of materiality, and since the NinthCircuit's reversal of the District Court's judgment did not rest upon thestandard used but upon the failure to submit the question to the jury. Itis worth noting, however, that some courts which regard materiality as a"legal" question for the judge do not require the higher burden of proof.See, e. g., United States v. Gribben, 984 F. 2d 47, 51 (CA2 1993); UnitedStates v. Chandler, 752 F. 2d 1148, 1151 (CA6 1985).2 We held in Williams v. Florida, 399 U. S. 78 (1970), that the 12-personrequirement to which Story referred is not an indispensable component ofthe right to trial by jury. But in so doing we emphasized that the jury'sdetermination of ultimate guilt is indispensable. The "essential featureof a jury," we said, is "the interposition between the accused and his accuser of the commonsense judgment of a group of laymen . . . [in] thatgroup's determination of guilt or innocence." Id., at 100. See also Apo515us2$81k 08-25-98 19:26:11 PAGES OPINPGT511Cite as: 515 U.

Id., at 540-541. See also Duncan v.Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 151-154 (1968) (tracing the historyof trial by jury).IIIThus far, the resolution of the question before us seemssimple. The Constitution gives a criminal defendant theright to demand that a jury find him guilty of all the ele-ments of the crime with which he is charged; one of theelements in the present case is materiality; respondenttherefore had a right to have the jury decide materiality.To escape the force of this logic, the Government offersessentially three arguments. Having conceded the minorpremise--that materiality is an element of the offense--theGovernment argues first, that the major premise is flawed;second, that (essentially) a page of history is worth a volumeof logic, and uniform practice simply excludes the element ofmateriality from the syllogism; and third, that stare decisisrequires the judgment here to be reversed.AAs to the first, the Government's position is that "material-ity," whether as a matter of logic or history, is a "legal" question, and that although we have sometimes spoken of "re-quiring the jury to decide `all the elements of a criminaloffense,' e. g., Estelle v. McGuire, [502 U. S. 62, 69] (1991);see Victor v. Nebraska, [511 U. S. 1, 5] (1994); Patterson v.New York, 432 U. S. 197, 210 (1977), the principle actuallyapplies toonly the factual components of the essential ele-ments." Brief for United States 33 (emphasis added). TheGovernment claims that this understanding of the jury's roledaca v. Oregon, 406 U. S. 404 (1972) (plurality opinion) (applying similaranalysis to conclude that jury unanimity is not constitutionally required).515us2$81k 08-25-98 19:26:11 PAGES OPINPGT512 UNITED STATES v. GAUDINOpinion of the Courtdates back to Sparf v. United States, 156 U. S. 51 (1895), andis reaffirmed by recent decisions of this Court.By limiting the jury's constitutionally prescribed roleto "the factual components of the essential elements" theGovernment surely does not mean to concede that the jurymust pass upon all elements that contain some factual com-ponent, for that test is amply met here. Deciding whether astatement is "material" requires the determination of atleast two subsidiary questions of purely historical fact: (a)"what statement was made?" and (b) "what decision wasthe agency trying to make?" The ultimate question: (c)"whether the statement was material to the decision," requires applying the legal standard of materiality (quotedabove) to these historical facts. What the Government apparently argues is that the Constitution requires only that(a) and (b) be determined by the jury, and that (c) may bedetermined by the judge. We see two difficulties with this.First, the application-of-legal-standard-to-fact sort of question posed by (c), commonly called a "mixed question of lawand fact," has typically been resolved by juries. See J.Thayer, Preliminary Treatise on Evidence at Common Law194, 249-250 (1898). Indeed, our cases have recognized inother contexts that the materiality inquiry, involving as itdoes "delicate assessments of the inferences a `reasonable[decisionmaker]' would draw from a given set of facts andthe significance of those inferences to him, . . . [is] peculiarlyon[e] for the trier of fact." TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., 426 U. S. 438, 450 (1976) (securities fraud); McLanahan v. Universal Ins. Co., 1 Pet. 170, 188-189, 191 (1828)(materiality of false statements in insurance applications).The second difficulty with the Government's position isthat it has absolutely no historical support. If it were true,the lawbooks would be full of cases, regarding materialityand innumerable other "mixed-law-and-fact" issues, in whichthe criminal jury was required to come forth with "findingsof fact" pertaining to each of the essential elements, leaving515us2$81k 08-25-98 19:26:11 PAGES OPINPGT513Cite as: 515 U. S. 506 (1995)Opinion of the Courtit to the judge to apply the law to those facts and render theultimate verdict of "guilty" or "not guilty." We know of nosuch case. Juries at the time of the framing could not beforced to produce mere "factual findings," but were entitledto deliver a general verdict pronouncing the defendant's guiltor innocence. Morgan, A Brief History of Special Verdictsand Special Interrogatories, 32 Yale L. J. 575, 591 (1922).See also G. Clementson, Special Verdicts and Special Find-ings by Juries 49 (1905); Alschuler & Deiss, A Brief Historyof the Criminal Jury in the United States, 61 U. Chi. L. Rev.867, 912-913 (1994). Justice Chase's defense to one of thecharges in his 1805 impeachment trial was that "he wellknows, that it is the right of juries in criminal cases, to givea general verdict of acquittal, which cannot be set aside onaccount of its being contrary to law, and that hence resultsthe power of juries, to decide on the law as well as on thefacts, in all criminal cases. This power he holds to be asacred part of our legal privileges . . . ." 1 S. Smith &T. Lloyd, Trial of Samuel Chase 34 (1805).Sparf, supra, the case on which the Government relies,had nothing to do with the issue before us here. The question there was whether the jury could be deprived of thepower to determine, not only historical facts, not only mixedquestions of fact and law, but pure questions of law in acriminal case. As the foregoing quotation from JusticeChase suggests, many thought the jury had such power.See generally Alschuler & Deiss, supra, at 902-916. We decided that it did not. In criminal cases, as in civil, we held,the judge must be permitted to instruct the jury on the lawand to insist that the jury follow his instructions. 156 U. S.,at 105-106. But our decision in no way undermined the historical and constitutionally guaranteed right of criminal defendants to demand that the jury decide guilt or innocenceon every issue, which includes application of the law to thefacts. To the contrary, Justice Harlan, writing for theCourt, explained the many judicial assertions of the jury's515us2$81k 08-25-98 19:26:11 PAGES OPINPGT514 UNITED STATES v. GAUDINOpinion of the Courtright to determine both law and fact as expressions of "theprinciple, that when the question is compounded of law andfact, a general verdict, ex necessitate, disposes of the case inhand, both as to law and fact." Id., at 90 (emphasis in original). He gave as an example the 1807 treason trial of AaronBurr in which Chief Justice Marshall charged the jury that" `levying war is an act compounded of law and fact; of whichthe jury, aided by the court must judge. . . . [And] hav[ing]now heard the opinion of the court on the law of the case[,][t]hey will apply that law to the facts, and will find a verdictof guilty or not guilty as their own consciences may direct.' "Id., at 67 (quoting 2 Burr's Trial 548, 550 (D. Robertson ed.1875)) (emphasis in original). Other expressions of the sameprinciple abound. See United States v. Battiste, 24 F. Cas.1042, 1043 (No. 14,545) (CC Mass. 1835) (Story, J., sitting asCircuit Justice) (the jury's general verdict is "necessarilycompounded of [both] law and fact"). As Thayer wrote atthe end of the 19th century: "From the beginning . . . it wasperceived that any general verdict, such as . . . not guilty,involved a conclusion of law, and that the jury did, in a sense,in such cases answer a question of law." Thayer, supra, at253.The more modern authorities the Government cites alsodo not support its concept of the criminal jury as mere factfinder. Although each contains language discussing thejury's role as factfinder, see Sullivan v. Louisiana, 508 U. S.275 (1993); Court of Ulster Cty. v. Allen, 442 U. S. 140, 156(1979); Patterson v. New York, 432 U. S. 197, 206 (1977); Inre Winship, 397 U. S. 358, 364 (1970), each also confirms thatthe jury's constitutional responsibility is not merely to determine the facts, but to apply the law to those facts and drawthe ultimate conclusion of guilt or innocence. The point isput with unmistakable clarity in Allen, which involved theconstitutionality of statutory inferences and presumptions.Such devices, Allen said, can help515us2$81k 08-25-98 19:26:11 PAGES OPINPGT515Cite as: 515 U. S. 506 (1995)Opinion of the Court"the trier of fact to determine the existence of an ele-ment of the crime--that is, an `ultimate' or `elemental'fact--from the existence of one or more `evidentiary' or`basic' facts . . . . Nonetheless, in criminal cases, theultimate test of any device's constitutional validity in agiven case remains constant: the device must not undermine the factfinder's responsibility at trial, based on evi-dence adduced by the State, to find theultimate factsbeyond a reasonable doubt." Allen, supra, at 156.See also Sullivan, supra, at 277 ("The right [to jury trial]includes, of course, as its most important element, the rightto have the jury, rather than the judge, reach the requisitefinding of `guilty' "); Patterson, supra, at 204; Winship,supra, at 361, 363. BThe Government next argues that, even if the jury is gen-erally entitled to pass on all elements of a crime, there is ahistorical exception for materiality determinations in per-jury prosecutions. We do not doubt that historical practiceis relevant to what the Constitution means by such conceptsas trial by jury, seeMurray's Lessee v. Hoboken Land &Improvement Co., 18 How. 272, 276-277 (1856); Holland v.Illinois, 493 U. S. 474, 481 (1990), and it is precisely historicalpractice that we have relied on in concluding that the jurymust find all the elements. The existence of a unique his-torical exception to this principle--and an exception thatreduces the power of the jury precisely when it is mostimportant,i. e., in a prosecution not for harming anotherindividual, but for offending against the Government itself--would be so extraordinary that the evidence for it wouldhave to be convincing indeed. It is not so.The practice of having courts determine the materiality offalse statements in perjury prosecutions is neither as old, noras uniform, as the Government suggests. In England, nopre-Revolution cases appear to have addressed the question,515us2$81k 08-25-98 19:26:11 PAGES OPINPGT516 UNITED STATES v. GAUDINOpinion of the Courtand the judges reached differing results when the issuefinally arose in the mid-19th century. CompareQueen v.Lavey, 3 Car. & K. 26, 30, 175 Eng. Rep. 448, 450 (Q. B. 1850)(materiality is a jury question),Queen v. Goddard, 2 F. & F.361, 175 Eng. Rep. 1096 (1861) (same), with Queen v. Courtney, 5 Ir. C. L. 434, 439 (Ct. Crim. App. 1856) (dictum) (mate-riality is a question for the judge);Queen v. Gibbon, Le. &Ca. 109, 113-114, 169 Eng. Rep. 1324, 1326 (1861) (same). Itwas not until 1911, 120 years after the adoption of our Bill ofRights, that the rule the Government argues for was finallyadopted in England--not by judicial decision but by Act ofParliament. See Perjury Act of 1911, $ 1(6), 1 & 2 Geo. V,ch. 6.Much more importantly, there was also no clear practiceof having the judge determine the materiality question inthis country at or near the time the Bill of Rights wasadopted. The Government cites Power v. Price, 16 Wend.450 (N. Y. 1836), as "[t]he earliest reported case on the question" whether "materiality in perjury prosecutions is a question for the court rather than the jury," claiming that there"New York's highest court held that a trial judge had correctly reserved the question of materiality to itself." Brieffor United States 18. Power held nothing even close to this.Power was not a perjury case; indeed, it was not even a criminal prosecution. It was a civil action in which Price suedPower for the slander of imputing to him the crime of perjury. The Court of Appeals held that Price did not need toprove the materiality of the alleged false statement in orderto make out a prima facie case; but that Power could raiseimmateriality as an affirmative defense negating intent toimpute perjury. 16 Wend., at 455-456. It then said thatthe trial court "was clearly right in instructing the jury thatthe testimony given on the former trial was proved to bematerial," since "it merely decided a question of law, arisingupon the proof of facts as to which there was no dispute orcontrariety of testimony." Id., at 456. But the courts'515us2$81k 08-25-98 19:26:11 PAGES OPINPGT517Cite as: 515 U. S. 506 (1995)Opinion of the Courtpower to resolve mixed-law-and-fact questions in civil casesis not at issue here; civil and criminal juries' required rolesare obviously not identical, or else there could be no directedverdicts for civil plaintiffs. The other early case relied uponby the Government, Steinman v. McWilliams, 6 Pa. 170,177-178 (1847), another slander case, is inapt for the samereason. The earliest American case involving the point thatwe have been able to find places the Government itself inopposition to its position here. InUnited States v. Cowing,25 F. Cas. 680, 681 (No. 14,880) (CC DC 1835), the UnitedStates argued that materiality in a perjury prosecution wasa matter for the jury's consideration, citing an unpublisheddecision of the General Court of Virginia. The federalcourt, however, did not address the issue.State and federal cases appear not to have addressed thequestion until the latter part of the 19th century, at whichtime they do not display anything like the "virtual unanimity" claimed by the Government. Brief for United States18. Some of the opinions cited by the Government, asserting that materiality was a question of "law" for the judge,appear to have involved either demurrers to the indictmentor appeals from convictions in which the case for materialitywas so weak that no reasonable juror could credit it--so thateven on our view of the matter the case should not have goneto the jury. (The prosecution's failure to provide minimalevidence of materiality, like its failure to provide minimalevidence of any other element, of course raises a question of"law" that warrants dismissal.) See, e. g., United States v.Shinn, 14 F. 447, 452 (CC Ore. 1882); United States v. Singleton, 54 F. 488, 489 (SD Ala. 1892); United States v. Bedgood,49 F. 54, 60 (SD Ala. 1891); Nelson v. State, 32 Ark. Rep. 192,195 (1877). And some of the other cited cases involve theconvicted defendant's claim that materiality should not havebeen decided by the jury, so that even if the issue was notone of the prosecution's failure to make a threshold case, itdid not arise in a context in which the defendant's right to515us2$81k 08-25-98 19:26:11 PAGES OPINPGT518 UNITED STATES v. GAUDINOpinion of the Courtjury trial was at issue. See, e. g., Cothran v. State, 39 Miss.541, 547 (1860);State v. Williams, 30 Mo. 364, 367 (1860);State v. Lewis, 10 Kan. 157, 160 (1872); People v. Lem You,97 Cal. 224, 228-230, 32 P. 11, 12 (1893);Thompson v. People,26 Colo. 496, 504, 59 P. 51, 54-55 (1899); Barnes v. State, 15Ohio C. C. 14, 25-26 (1897).Even assuming, however, that all the Government's lasthalf-of-the-19th-century cases fully stand for the propositionthat the defendant has no right to jury determination of materiality, there are cases that support the other view. SeeCommonwealth v. Grant, 116 Mass. 17, 20 (1874); Lawrencev. State, 2 Tex. Crim. 479, 483-484 (1877); State v. Spencer,45 La. Ann. 1, 11-12, 12 So. 135, 138 (1893); Young v. People,134 Ill. 37, 42, 24 N. E. 1070, 1071 (1890) (approving the treatment of materiality as "a mixed question of law and fact,and thus one for the jury"). At most there had developed adivision of authority on the point, as the treatise writers ofthe period amply demonstrate. Bishop in 1872 took the position that "[p]ractically, . . . the whole subject is to be passedupon by the jury, under instructions from the judge, as involving, like most other cases, mixed questions of law and offact." 2 J. Bishop, Commentaries on Law of Criminal Procedure $ 935, p. 508 (2d ed.). May's 1881 treatise reported that"[w]hether materiality is a question of law for the court orof fact for a jury, is a point upon which the authorities areabout equally divided." J. May, Law of Crimes $ 188, p. 205.Greenleaf, writing in 1883, sided with Bishop ("It seems thatthe materiality of the matter assigned is a question for thejury"), 3 S. Greenleaf, Law of Evidence $ 195, p. 189, n. (b)(14th ed.)--but two editions later, in 1899, said that the question was one for the judge, 3 S. Greenleaf, Law of Evidence$ 195, p. 196, n. 2 (16th ed.).In sum, we find nothing like a consistent historical tradition supporting the proposition that the element of materiality in perjury prosecutions is to be decided by the judge.Since that proposition is contrary to the uniform general un515us2$81k 08-25-98 19:26:11 PAGES OPINPGT519Cite as: 515 U. S. 506 (1995)Opinion of the Courtderstanding (and we think the only understanding consistentwith principle) that the Fifth and Sixth Amendments requireconviction by a jury of all elements of the crime, we mustreject those cases that have embraced it. Though uniformpostratification practice can shed light upon the meaning ofan ambiguous constitutional provision, the practice here isnot uniform, and the core meaning of the constitutional guar-antees is unambiguous.CThe Government's final argument is that the principle ofstare decisis requires that we deny respondent's constitutional claim, citing our decision in Sinclair v. United States,279 U. S. 263 (1929). That case is not controlling in thestrictest sense, since it involved the assertion of a SixthAmendment right to have the jury determine, not "materiality" under $ 1001, but rather "pertinency" under that provi-sion of Title 2 making it criminal contempt of Congress torefuse to answer a "question pertinent to [a] question under[congressional] inquiry," Rev. Stat. $ 102, 2 U. S. C. $ 192.The two questions are similar, however, and the essentialargument made by respondent here was made by appellantin that case, who sought reversal of his conviction because ofthe trial court's failure to submit the question of pertinencyto the jury: "[I]t has been said over and over again, thatevery essential ingredient of the crime must be proven tothe satisfaction of the jury beyond a reasonable doubt."Brief for Appellant in Sinclair v. United States, O. T. 1928,No. 555, p. 109; 279 U. S., at 277 (argument for appellant).Though we did not address the constitutional argument explicitly, we held that the question of pertinency was "rightlydecided by the court as one of law."Id., at 298. And tyingthe case even closer to the present one was our dictum thatpertinency "is not essentially different from . . . materialityof false testimony," which "when an element in the crime ofperjury, is one for the court." Ibid. Thus, while Sinclairis not strictly controlling, it is fair to say that we cannot hold515us2$81k 08-25-98 19:26:11 PAGES OPINPGT520 UNITED STATES v. GAUDINOpinion of the Courtfor respondent today while still adhering to the reasoningand the holding of that case.But the reasoning of Sinclair has already been repudiatedin a number of respects. The opinion rested upon the assumption that "pertinency" is a pure question of law--thatis, it does "not depend upon the probative value of evidence."Ibid. We contradicted that assumption in Deutch v. UnitedStates, 367 U. S. 456 (1961), reversing a conviction under$ 192 because "the Government at the trial failed to carry itsburden of proving the pertinence of the questions." Id., at469. Though it had introduced documentary and testimonialevidence "to show the subject of the subcommittee's inquiry," it had failed to provide evidence to support the conclusion that the petitioner's false statement was pertinent tothat subject.Our holding in Sinclair rested also upon the assertion that"[i]t would be incongruous and contrary to well-establishedprinciples to leave the determination of [the] matter [of pertinency] to a jury," 279 U. S., at 299, citing ICC v. Brimson,154 U. S. 447, 489 (1894), and Horning v. District of Columbia, 254 U. S. 135 (1920). Both the cases cited to supportthat assertion have since been repudiated. Brimson's holding that no right to jury trial attaches to criminal contemptproceedings was overruled in Bloom v. Illinois, 391 U. S.194, 198-200 (1968). Horning's holding that it was harmlesserror, if error at all, for a trial judge effectively to order thejury to convict, see 254 U. S., at 138, has been proved anunfortunate anomaly in light of subsequent cases. SeeQuercia v. United States, 289 U. S. 466, 468, 472 (1933); Bihnv. United States, 328 U. S. 633, 637-639 (1946).Other reasoning in Sinclair, not yet repudiated, we repudiate now. It said that the question of pertinency "may belikened to those concerning relevancy at the trial of issuesin court," which "is uniformly held [to be] a question of law"for the court. 279 U.

S. 506 (1995)Opinion of the Courtdence says nothing about how relevancy should be treatedwhen (like "pertinence" or "materiality") it is made an element of a criminal offense. It is commonplace for the samemixed question of law and fact to be assigned to the courtfor one purpose, and to the jury for another. The questionof probable cause to conduct a search, for example, is re-solved by the judge when it arises in the context of a motionto suppress evidence obtained in the search; but by the jurywhen it is one of the elements of the crime of depriving aperson of constitutional rights under color of law, see 18U. S. C. $$ 241-242. Cf.United States v. McQueeney, 674F. 2d 109, 114 (CA1 1982); United States v. Barker, 546 F. 2d940, 947 (CADC 1976).That leaves as the sole prop for Sinclair its reliance uponthe unexamined proposition, never before endorsed by thisCourt, that materiality in perjury cases (which is analogousto pertinence in contempt cases) is a question of law for thejudge. But just as there is nothing to support Sinclair except that proposition, there is, as we have seen, nothing tosupport that proposition except Sinclair. While this perfect circularity has a certain esthetic appeal, it has no logic.We do not minimize the role that stare decisis plays in ourjurisprudence. See Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491U. S. 164, 172 (1989). That role is somewhat reduced, however, in the case of a procedural rule such as this, whichdoes not serve as a guide to lawful behavior. See Payne v.Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 828 (1991). It is reduced all themore when the rule is not only procedural but rests upon aninterpretation of the Constitution. See ibid. And we thinkstare decisis cannot possibly be controlling when, in additionto those factors, the decision in question has been provedmanifestly erroneous, and its underpinnings eroded, by subsequent decisions of this Court. Rodriguez de Quijas v.Shearson/American Express, Inc., 490 U. S. 477, 480-481(1989); Andrews v. Louisville & Nashville R. Co., 406 U. S.320 (1972).515us2$81k 08-25-98 19:26:11 PAGES OPINPGT522 UNITED STATES v. GAUDINOpinion of the CourtThe Government also claims stare decisis benefit from ourdecision in Kungys v. United States, 485 U. S. 759 (1988),which held that, in appellate review of a District Court (non-jury) denaturalization proceeding, the appellate court'snewly asserted standard of materiality could be applied tothe facts by the appellate court itself, rather than requiringremand to the District Court for that application. Id., at772. But as we have observed, the characterization of amixed question of law and fact for one purpose does not gov-ern its characterization for all purposes. It is hard to imagine questions more diverse than, on the one hand, whetheran appellate court must remand to a district court for a determination of materiality in a denaturalization proceeding(Kungys) and, on the other hand, whether the Constitutionrequires the finding of the element of materiality in a crimi-nal prosecution to be made by the jury (the present case).It can be argued that Kungys itself did not heed this advice,since it relied upon both our prior decision in Sinclair, see485 U. S., at 772, and a decision of the United States Courtof Appeals for the Sixth Circuit holding that materiality in a$ 1001 prosecution is a question of " `law' " for the court, ibid.(quotingUnited States v. Abadi, 706 F. 2d 178, 180, cert. de-nied, 464 U. S. 821 (1983)). But the result in Kungys couldbe thought to follow a fortiori from the quite different casesof Sinclair and Abadi, whereas nonentitlement under theSixth Amendment to a jury determination cannot possiblybe thought to followa fortiori from Kungys. In any event,Kungys assuredly did not involve an adjudication to whichthe Sixth Amendment right to jury trial attaches, see Luriav. United States, 231 U. S. 9 (1913), and hence had no reasonto explore the constitutional ramifications of Sinclair andAbadi, as we do today. Whatever support it gave to thevalidity of those decisions was obiter dicta, and may properlybe disregarded.* * *The Constitution gives a criminal defendant the right tohave a jury determine, beyond a reasonable doubt, his guilt515us2$81k 08-25-98 19:26:11 PAGES OPINPGT523Cite as: 515 U.

Thetrial judge's refusal to allow the jury to pass on the "materiality" of Gaudin's false statements infringed that right. Thejudgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.
