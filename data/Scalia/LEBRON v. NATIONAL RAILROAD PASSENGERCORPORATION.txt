In this case we consider whether actions of the NationalRailroad Passenger Corporation, commonly known as Amtrak, are subject to the constraints of the Constitution.IPetitioner, Michael A. Lebron, creates billboard displaysthat involve commentary on public issues, and that seemingly propel him into litigation. See, e. g., Lebron v. Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, 749 F. 2d 893(CADC 1984). In August 1991, he contacted TransportationDisplays, Incorporated (TDI), which manages the leasing ofthe billboards in Amtrak's Pennsylvania Station in New YorkCity, seeking to display an advertisement on a billboard ofcolossal proportions, known to New Yorkers (or at least tothe more Damon Runyonesque among them) as "the Spectac-ular." The Spectacular is a curved, illuminated billboard,approximately 103 feet long and 10 feet high, which domi-nates the main entrance to Penn Station's waiting room andticket area.On November 30, 1992, Lebron signed a contract with TDIto display an advertisement on the Spectacular for twomonths beginning in January 1993. The contract providedthat "[a]ll advertising copy is subject to approval of TDI and[Amtrak] as to character, text, illustration, design and operation." App. 671. Lebron declined to disclose the specificcontent of his advertisement throughout his negotiations*Briefs of amici curiae urging reversal were filed for the AmericanCivil Liberties Union by Stephen R. Shapiro, Marjorie Heins, and ArthurN. Eisenberg; and for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund,Inc., et al. by James F. Fitzpatrick, Elliot M. Mincberg, and LawrenceS. Ottinger.513us2$22K 04-01-98 17:46:13 PAGES OPINPGT377Cite as: 513 U. S. 374 (1995)Opinion of the Courtwith TDI, although he did explain to TDI that it was gener-ally political. On December 2, he submitted to TDI (andTDI later forwarded to Amtrak) an advertisement describedby the District Court as follows:"The work is a photomontage, accompanied by consider-able text. Taking off on a widely circulated Coors beeradvertisement which proclaims Coors to be the `RightBeer,' Lebron's piece is captioned `Is it the Right's BeerNow?' It includes photographic images of convivialdrinkers of Coors beer, juxtaposed with a Nicaraguanvillage scene in which peasants are menaced by a can ofCoors that hurtles towards them, leaving behind a trailof fire, as if it were a missile. The accompanying text,appearing on either end of the montage, criticizes theCoors family for its support of right-wing causes, particularly the contras in Nicaragua. Again taking off onCoors' advertising which uses the slogan of `Silver Bullet' for its beer cans, the text proclaims that Coors is`The Silver Bullet that aims The Far Right's politicalagenda at the heart of America.' " 811 F. Supp. 993, 995(SDNY 1993).Amtrak's vice president disapproved the advertisement, in-voking Amtrak's policy, inherited from its predecessor aslandlord of Penn Station, the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, "that it will not allow political advertising on the[S]pectacular advertising sign." App. 285.Lebron then filed suit against Amtrak and TDI, claiming,inter alia, that the refusal to place his advertisement on theSpectacular had violated his First and Fifth Amendmentrights. After expedited discovery, the District Court ruledthat Amtrak, because of its close ties to the Federal Government, was a Government actor, at least for First Amendmentpurposes, and that its rejection of Lebron's proposed advertisement as unsuitable for display in Penn Station had violated the First Amendment. The court granted Lebron an513us2$22K 04-01-98 17:46:13 PAGES OPINPGT378 LEBRON v. NATIONAL RAILROAD PASSENGERCORPORATIONOpinion of the Courtinjunction and ordered Amtrak and TDI to display Lebron'sadvertisement on the Spectacular.The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuitreversed. 12 F. 3d 388 (1993). The panel's opinion firstnoted that Amtrak was, by the terms of the legislation thatcreated it, not a Government entity,id., at 390; and thenconcluded that the Federal Government was not so involvedwith Amtrak that the latter's decisions could be consideredfederal action, id., at 391-392. Chief Judge Newman dissented. We granted certiorari. 511 U. S. 1105 (1994).IIWe have held once, Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority, 365 U. S. 715 (1961), and said many times, that ac-tions of private entities can sometimes be regarded as governmental action for constitutional purposes. See, e. g., SanFrancisco Arts & Athletics, Inc. v. United States OlympicComm., 483 U. S. 522, 546 (1987); Blum v. Yaretsky, 457 U. S.991, 1004 (1982); Moose Lodge No. 107 v. Irvis, 407 U. S. 163,172 (1972). It is fair to say that "our cases deciding whenprivate action might be deemed that of the state have notbeen a model of consistency." Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Co., 500 U. S. 614, 632 (1991) (O'Connor, J., dissenting).It may be unnecessary to traverse that difficult terrain in thepresent case, since Lebron's first argument is that Amtrak isnot a private entity but Government itself. Before turningto the merits of this argument, however, it is necessary todiscuss the propriety of reaching it. Lebron did not raisethis point below; indeed, he expressly disavowed it in boththe District Court and the Court of Appeals. See Plaintiff 'sPre-Trial Proposed Conclusions of Law in No. 92-CIV-9411(SDNY), p. 12, n. 1, reprinted in App. in No. 93-7127 (CA2),p. 1297; Brief for Appellee in No. 93-7127 (CA2), p. 30, n. 39.In those courts Lebron argued that Amtrak's actions weresubject to constitutional requirements because Amtrak, al513us2$22K 04-01-98 17:46:13 PAGES OPINPGT379Cite as: 513 U. S. 374 (1995)Opinion of the Courtthough a private entity, was closely connected with federalentities. It was not until after we granted certiorari thatLebron first explicitly presented--in his brief on the merits--the alternative argument that Amtrak was itself a federal entity.Our traditional rule is that "[o]nce a federal claim is properly presented, a party can make any argument in supportof that claim; parties are not limited to the precise arguments they made below." Yee v. Escondido, 503 U. S. 519,534 (1992); see also Dewey v. Des Moines, 173 U. S. 193, 198(1899). Lebron's contention that Amtrak is part of the Government is in our view not a new claim within the meaningof that rule, but a new argument to support what has beenhis consistent claim: that Amtrak did not accord him therights it was obliged to provide by the First Amendment.Cf. Yee, supra, at 534-535. In fact, even if this were a claimnot raised by petitioner below, we would ordinarily feel freeto address it, since it was addressed by the court below.Our practice "permit[s] review of an issue not pressed so longas it has been passed upon . . . ." United States v. Williams,504 U. S. 36, 41 (1992). See Virginia Bankshares, Inc. v.Sandberg, 501 U. S. 1083, 1099, n. 8 (1991); Stevens v. Department of Treasury, 500 U. S. 1, 8 (1991).Respondent asserts that, in addition to not having beenraised below, the issue of whether Amtrak is a Governmententity was not presented in the petition for certiorari. Asthis Court's Rule 14.1(a) and simple prudence dictate, we willnot reach questions not fairly included in the petition. "TheCourt decides which questions to consider through wellestablished procedures; allowing the able counsel who arguebefore us to alter these questions or to devise additionalquestions at the last minute would thwart this system."Taylor v. Freeland & Kronz, 503 U. S. 638, 646 (1992). Here,however, we are satisfied that the argument that Amtrak isa Government entity is fairly embraced within the question513us2$22K 04-01-98 17:46:13 PAGES OPINPGT380 LEBRON v. NATIONAL RAILROAD PASSENGERCORPORATIONOpinion of the Courtset forth in the petition for certiorari 1--which explicitlypresents neither the "Government entity" theory nor the"closely connected to Government" theory of First Amend-ment application, but rather the facts that would supportboth. The argument in the petition, moreover, thoughcouched in terms of a different but closely related theory,fairly embraced the argument that Lebron now advances.See Pet. for Cert. 16-18.The dissent contends that the "Government entity" ques-tion in the present case occupies the same status, insofar asRule 14.1(a) is concerned, as the "physical taking" questionwhich we deemed excluded inYee v. Escondido, supra. Itgives two reasons for that equivalence: First, the fact thatLebron prefaced his question presented by the phrase,"Whether the court of appeals erred in holding." App. toPet. for Cert. i. The dissent asserts that this is similar tothe preface inYee, which had the effect of limiting the ques-tion to the precise ground relied upon by the Court of Appeal. Post, at 402. But the preface in Yee was not at allsimilar. What we said caused the question presented to belimited to the physical-taking issue was not the fact that thatwas the only ground addressed by the lower-court-said-tobe-in-error; but rather the fact that that was the only groundof decision in two previous Court of Appeals cases,departure1 Certiorari was sought and granted in this case on the followingquestion:"Whether the court of appeals erred in holding that Amtrak's assertedpolicy barring the display of political advertising messages in Pennsylvania Station, New York, was not state action, where:"(a) the United States created Amtrak, endowed it with governmentalpowers, owns all its voting stock, and appoints all members of its Board;"(b) the United States-appointed Board approved the advertising policychallenged here;"(c) the United States keeps Amtrak afloat every year by subsidizingits losses; and"(d) Pennsylvania Station was purchased for Amtrak by the UnitedStates and is shared with several other governmental entities."513us2$22K 04-01-98 17:46:13 PAGES OPINPGT381Cite as: 513 U. S. 374 (1995)Opinion of the Courtfrom which was said by the question presented to be theissue in the appeal.2 503 U. S., at 536-537.The dissent's second reason for believing that Yee governsthe Rule 14.1(a) issue here is that the structural relationshipbetween the clearly presented question and the assertedlyincluded question in the two cases is the same. As the dis-sent correctly analyzesYee, it involved one "umbrella claim"(government taking of property without just compensation)and "two distinct questions" that were "[s]ubsidiary to thatclaim" (whether a physical taking had occurred, and whethera regulatory taking had occurred).Post, at 401. But thequestions in Yee were "distinct" in two important ways thatthe claims here are not. First of all, it was possible to consider the existence of a physical taking without assuming (asone of the premises of the inquiry) the nonexistence of aregulatory taking; whereas here it is quite impossible to consider whether the Government connections are sufficient toconvert private-entity Amtrak into a Government actorwithout first assuming that Amtrak is a private entity. Theopinion in Yee did not have to begin: "Assuming that no regulatory taking has occurred, . . . ." But the portion of today'sdissent addressing the merits of this case must begin:"Accepting Lebron's concession that Amtrak is a privateentity, . . . ." Post, at 408. The question of private-entitystatus is, in other words, a prior question. The secondrespect in which the issues here are less "distinct" than inYee is that the factors relevant to their resolution overlap.In Yee, what would go to show a regulatory taking and2 The question presented in Yee read as follows:" `Two federal courts of appeal have held that the transfer of a premiumvalue to a departing mobilehome tenant, representing the value of theright to occupy at a reduced rate under local mobilehome rent controlordinances, constitute[s] an impermissible taking. Was it error for thestate appellate court to disregard the rulings and hold that there wasno taking under the fifth and fourteenth amendments?' " 503 U. S., at536-537.513us2$22K 04-01-98 17:46:13 PAGES OPINPGT382 LEBRON v. NATIONAL RAILROAD PASSENGERCORPORATIONOpinion of the Courtwhat would go to show a physical taking were quitedifferent. Here, however, those very elements that wewould be considering in determining whether Amtrak-theprivate-entity is so closely connected with the Governmentas to be a Government actor (for example, the constitutionof its board) also bear upon whether it is in fact a privateentity at all. When a question is, like this one, both priorto the clearly presented question and dependent upon manyof the same factual inquiries, refusing to regard it as embraced within the petition may force us to assume what thefacts will show to be ridiculous, a risk that ought to beavoided.The recent decision of ours that invites comparison withthe dissent's insistence that the "Government entity" question is "precluded," post, at 400, is not Yee, but United StatesNat. Bank of Ore. v. Independent Ins. Agents of America,Inc., 508 U. S. 439 (1993). There, in a case raising the question of the proper interpretation of 12 U. S. C. $ 92 (1926 ed.),we upheld the propriety of the Court of Appeals' consideringthe prior question whether 12 U. S. C. $ 92 had been inadvertently repealed--even though the parties themselves hadfailed to raise that question, not only (as here) in the courtbelow, but even in the initial briefs and oral arguments before the Court of Appeals itself. That is to say, the situationthere, at the court of appeals level, was what the situationwould be before us here, if (1) the dissent were correct thatRule 14.1(a) was not complied with, and (2) in addition, eventhe petitioner's principal brief and oral argument had failedto raise the "Government entity" issue. Even so, we held inIndependent Insurance Agents that it was proper for theCourt of Appeals to request supplemental briefing upon, andto decide, the statutory repeal question, and we then wenton to inquire into that question ourselves. Our opinion wasunanimous, not a single Justice protesting that the judgesof the Court of Appeals, or of this Court, had constituted513us2$22K 04-01-98 17:46:13 PAGES OPINPGT383Cite as: 513 U.

Agents than a narrowholding that the Court of Appeals' decision to reach the statutory repealissue was not so imprudent as to be reversible for abuse of discretion.Even that is a damaging concession, given the dissent's apparent positionthat allowing a litigant "to resuscitate [a] claim that he himself put torest" always violates "prudential" rules. Post, at 406. But in fact thelanguage of the Independent Ins. Agents opinion is much more approvingof the Court of Appeals' action than that. It declines even to brush asidethe Court of Appeals' (questionable) contention that there was "a `duty' toaddress the status of section 92," saying only that "[w]e need not decide"that question. 508 U. S., at 448. And it goes on to state that the Courtof Appeals acted "without any impropriety," and that its decision to consider the issue was "certainly no abuse of its discretion." Ibid. (emphasisadded). If we had not thought that the Court of Appeals' entertainmentof the statutory repeal question was, not merely unreversible, but appropriate, we would not have rendered ourselves complicit in the enterpriseby exercising our own discretion to grant certiorari on that question.(There was no particular need to intervene, since the Court of Appealshad upheld the law.)The dissent also seeks to characterize Independent Ins. Agents as nomore than an application of "the traditional principle that there can be noestoppel in the way of ascertaining the existence of a law." Post, at 404(internal quotation marks omitted). It was indeed an application of thatprinciple insofar as concerned the claim that the appellants' right to assertrepeal of the statute had been forfeited. But forfeit was not the onlypoint decided in the case: not every nonforfeited claim merits consideration on appeal.513us2$22K 04-01-98 17:46:13 PAGES OPINPGT384 LEBRON v.

See generally National Railroad PassengerCorporation v. Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co., 470 U. S. 451,453-456 (1985). As initially conceived, Amtrak was to be513us2$22K 04-01-98 17:46:13 PAGES OPINPGT385Cite as: 513 U. S. 374 (1995)Opinion of the Court"a for profit corporation," 84 Stat. 1330, but Congress latermodified this language to provide, less optimistically perhaps, that Amtrak "shall be operated and managed as a forprofit corporation," $ 541.Amtrak is incorporated under the District of ColumbiaBusiness Corporation Act, D. C. Code Ann. $ 29-301 et seq.(1981 and Supp. 1994), but is subject to the provisions of thatAct only insofar as the RPSA does not provide to the con-trary, see $ 541. It does provide to the contrary with respect to many matters of structure and power, including themanner of selecting the company's board of directors. TheRPSA provides for a board of nine members, six of whomare appointed directly by the President of the United States.The Secretary of Transportation, or his designee, sits exofficio. $ 543(a)(1)(A). The President appoints three moredirectors with the advice and consent of the Senate,$ 543(a)(1)(C), selecting one from a list of individuals recommended by the Railway Labor Executives Association,$ 543(a)(1)(C)(i), one "from among the Governors of Stateswith an interest in rail transportation," $ 543(a)(1)(C)(ii), andone as a "representative of business with an interest in railtransportation," $ 543(a)(1)(C)(iii). These directors serve4-year terms. $ 543(a)(2)(A).

These directorsserve 2-year terms. $ 543(a)(2)(B). The holders of Amtrak's preferred stock select two more directors, who serve1-year terms. $ 543(a)(1)(E). Since the United States presently holds all of Amtrak's preferred stock, which it received(and still receives) in exchange for its subsidization of Amtrak's perennial losses, see $ 544(c), the Secretary of Transportation selects these two directors. The ninth member ofthe board is Amtrak's president, $ 543(a)(1)(B), who servesas the chairman of the board, $ 543(a)(4), is selected by theother eight directors, and serves at their pleasure, $ 543(d).513us2$22K 04-01-98 17:46:13 PAGES OPINPGT386 LEBRON v.

In considering the question before us,it is useful to place Amtrak within its proper context in thelong history of corporations created and participated in bythe United States for the achievement of governmentalobjectives.The first was the Bank of the United States, created bythe Act of Feb. 25, 1791, ch. 10, 1 Stat. 191, which authorizedthe United States to subscribe 20 percent of the corporation'sstock,id., at 196. That Bank expired pursuant to the termsof its authorizing Act 20 years later. A second Bank of theUnited States, the bank of McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat.316 (1819), andOsborn v. Bank of United States, 9 Wheat.738 (1824), was incorporated by the Act of April 10, 1816, 34 Originally, Amtrak's board comprised 15 directors: 7 selected by theshareholders and 8 (one of whom had to be the Secretary of Transportation) appointed by the President of the United States. See RPSA$$ 303(a) and (c), 84 Stat. 1330-1331. In 1973, Congress increased thenumber of directors to 17, the number of Presidential appointees to 9, andmade the Secretary of Transportation a director ex officio. See AmtrakImprovement Act of 1973, $ 3(a), 87 Stat. 548. In 1976, the number ofPresidential appointees (apart from the Secretary of Transportation) wasreduced to eight and Amtrak's president made a director ex officio. SeeRail Transportation Improvement Act, $ 103, 90 Stat. 2615. Amtrak'sboard was given its current size and membership in 1981. See OmnibusBudget Reconciliation Act of 1981, $ 1174, 95 Stat. 689.513us2$22K 04-01-98 17:46:13 PAGES OPINPGT387Cite as: 513 U.

Remini, Andrew Jackson and the Bank War155-175 (1967). During the remainder of the 19th century,the Federal Government continued to charter private corporations, see, e. g., Act of July 2, 1864, 13 Stat. 365 (NorthernPacific Railroad Company), but only once participated in sucha venture itself: the Union Pacific Railroad, chartered in 1862with the specification that two of its directors would be appointed by the President of the United States. Act of July1, 1862, $ 1, 12 Stat. 491. See F. Leazes, Jr., Accountabilityand the Business State 117, n. 8 (1987) (hereinafter Leazes).The Federal Government's first participation in a corporate enterprise in which (as with Amtrak) it appointed a majority of the directors did not occur until the present century.In 1902, to facilitate construction of the Panama Canal, Congress authorized the President to purchase the assets of theNew Panama Canal Company of France, including that company's stock holdings in the Panama Railroad Company, aprivate corporation chartered in 1849 by the State of NewYork. See Act of June 28, 1902, 32 Stat. 481; see also General Accounting Office, Reference Manual of GovernmentCorporations, S. Doc. No. 86, 79th Cong., 1st Sess., 176 (1945)(hereinafter GAO Corporation Manual). The United Statesbecame the sole shareholder of the Panama Railroad, andcontinued to operate it under its original charter, with theSecretary of War, as the holder of the stock, electing theRailroad's 13 directors.

NATIONAL RAILROAD PASSENGERCORPORATIONOpinion of the Court78th Cong., 2d Sess., 20 (1944) (hereinafter Reduction ofExpenditures).The first large-scale use of Government-controlled corpo-rations came with the First World War. In 1917 and 1918,Congress created, among others, the United States GrainCorporation, the United States Emergency Fleet Corpora-tion, the United States Spruce Production Corporation, andthe War Finance Corporation. See Leazes 20. These enti-ties were dissolved after the war ended. See Reduction ofExpenditures 1.The Great Depression brought the next major group ofGovernment corporations, which proved to be more enduring. These were primarily directed to stabilizing the economy and to making distress loans to farms, homeowners,banks, and other enterprises. See R. Moe, CRS Report forCongress, Administering Public Functions at the Margins ofGovernment: The Case of Federal Corporations 6-7 (1983).The Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC), to take thepremier example, was initially authorized to make loans tobanks, insurance companies, railroads, land banks, and agricultural credit organizations, including loans secured by theassets of failed banks. See Act of Jan. 22, 1932, $ 5, 47 Stat.6-7. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC),was established to hold and liquidate the assets of failedbanks, and to insure bank deposits. See Act of June 16,1933, ch. 89, $ 8, 48 Stat. 168, as amended, 12 U. S. C. $ 1811et seq. (1988 ed. and Supp. V). And a few corporations, suchas the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), brought the Government into the commercial sale of goods and services.See Act of May 18, 1933, ch. 32, 48 Stat. 58, as amended, 16U. S. C. $ 831 et seq. (1988 ed. and Supp. V).The growth of federal corporations during the Depressionand the World War II era was not limited to the numerousentities specifically approved by Congress. In 1940, Congress empowered the RFC to create corporations withoutspecific congressional authorization. See Act of June 25,513us2$22K 04-01-98 17:46:13 PAGES OPINPGT389Cite as: 513 U. S. 374 (1995)Opinion of the Court1940, $ 5, 54 Stat. 573-574. The RFC proceeded to do sowith gusto, incorporating on its own the Defense Plant Corporation, the Defense Supplies Corporation, the Metals Re-serve Company (which itself created several subsidiaries),the Petroleum Reserves Corporation, the Rubber Development Corporation, and the War Damage Corporation, amongothers. See GAO Corporation Manual 32, 38, 169, 182, 219,279. Other corporations were formed, sometimes understate law, without even the general congressional authorization granted the RFC. For example, the Defense HomesCorporation was organized under Maryland law by the Secretary of the Treasury, using emergency funds allocated tothe President, id., at 28 ("It is not clear what, if any, specificFederal statutory authority was relied upon for the creationof the Defense Homes Corporation"); and the Tennessee Valley Associated Cooperatives, Inc., was chartered under Tennessee law by the TVA, id., at 244 ("There has been foundno Federal statute specifically authorizing the Board ofDirectors of the Tennessee Valley Authority to organizea corporation"). By 1945, the General Accounting Office'sReference Manual of Government Corporations listed 58government corporations, with total assets (in 1945 dollars)of $29.6 billion. See id., at iii, v-vi.By the end of World War II, Government-created and-controlled corporations had gotten out of hand, in both theirnumber and their lack of accountability. Congress moved toreestablish order in the Government Corporation ControlAct (GCCA), 59 Stat. 597, as amended, 31 U. S. C. $ 9101 etseq. (1988 ed. and Supp. V). See Pritchett, The GovernmentCorporation Control Act of 1945, 40 Am. Pol. Sci. Rev. 495(1946). The GCCA required that specified corporations,both wholly owned and partially owned by the Government,be audited by the Comptroller General. See 59 Stat. 599,600. Additionally, the wholly owned corporations were required, for the first time, to submit budgets which would beincluded in the budget submitted annually to Congress by513us2$22K 04-01-98 17:46:13 PAGES OPINPGT390 LEBRON v. NATIONAL RAILROAD PASSENGERCORPORATIONOpinion of the Courtthe President. Id., at 598; see also Leazes 22-23. TheGCCA also ordered the dissolution or liquidation of allgovernment corporations created under state law, exceptfor those that Congress should act to reincorporate; andprohibited creation of new Government corporations without specific congressional authorization. 59 Stat. 602; cf. 31U. S. C. $ 9102.Thus, in the years immediately following World War II,many Government corporations were dissolved, and to ourknowledge only one, the Saint Lawrence Seaway Develop-ment Corporation, was created. See Leazes 25, 27. In the1960's, however, the allure of the corporate form was feltagain, and new entities proliferated. Many of them followedthe traditional model, often explicitly designated as Government agencies and located within the existing Governmentstructure. See, e. g., Foreign Assistance Act of 1969, $ 105,83 Stat. 809 (creating the Overseas Private Investment Corporation as "an agency of the United States under the policyguidance of the Secretary of State"), as amended, 22 U. S. C.$ 2191 et seq. (1988 ed. and Supp. V). Beginning in 1962,however, the Government turned to sponsoring corporationsthat it specifically designated not to be agencies or establishments of the United States Government, and declined to subject to the control mechanisms of the GCCA. The first ofthese, the Communications Satellite Corporation (Comsat),was incorporated under the District of Columbia BusinessCorporation Act, D. C. Code Ann. $ 29-301 et seq. (1981 andSupp. 1994), see 47 U. S. C. $ 731 et seq., with the purpose ofentering the private sector, but doing so with Governmentconferred advantages, see Moe, supra, at 22. Comsat wascapitalized entirely with private funds. See Seidman,Government-sponsored Enterprise in the United States, inThe New Political Economy: The Public Use of the PrivateSector 92 (B. Smith ed. 1975). In contrast to the corporations that had in the past been deemed part of the Government, Comsat's board was to be controlled by its private513us2$22K 04-01-98 17:46:13 PAGES OPINPGT391Cite as: 513 U. S. 374 (1995)Opinion of the Courtshareholders; only 3 of its 15 directors were appointed by thePresident, $ 733(a).The Comsat model, which was seen as allowing the Gov-ernment to act unhindered by the restraints of bureaucracyand politics, see Moe, CRS Report, at 22, 24, was soon fol-lowed in creating other corporations. But some of thesenew "private" corporations, though said by their charters notto be agencies or instrumentalities of the Government, see,e. g., 47 U. S. C. $ 396(b) (Corporation for Public Broadcasting(CPB)); 42 U. S. C. $ 2996d(e)(1) (Legal Services Corporation(LSC)), and though not subjected to the restrictions of theGCCA, were (unlike Comsat) managed by boards of directorson which Government appointees had not just a few votesbut voting control. See Public Broadcasting Act of 1967,$ 201, 81 Stat. 369 (CPB's entire board appointed by Presi-dent); Legal Services Corporation Act of 1974, $ 2, 88 Stat.379 (same for LSC).Amtrak is yet another variation upon the Comsat theme.Like Comsat, CPB, and LSC, its authorizing statute declaresthat it "will not be an agency or establishment of the UnitedStates Government." 84 Stat. 1330; see 45 U. S. C. $ 541.Unlike Comsat, but like CPB and LSC, its board of directorsis controlled by Government appointees. And unlike allthree of those "private" corporations, ithas been added tothe list of corporations covered by the GCCA, see 31 U. S. C.$ 9101 (1988 ed. and Supp. V). As one perceptive observerhas concluded with regard to the post-Comsat Governmentsponsored "private" enterprises:"There is no valid basis for distinguishing between manygovernment-sponsored enterprises and other types ofgovernment activities, except for the fact that they aredesigned [designated?] by law as `not an agency andinstrumentality of the United States Government.'Comparable powers and immunities could be grantedto such agencies without characterizing them as non-government." Seidman, supra, at 93.513us2$22K 04-01-98 17:46:13 PAGES OPINPGT392 LEBRON v. NATIONAL RAILROAD PASSENGERCORPORATIONOpinion of the CourtIVAmtrak claims that, whatever its relationship with theFederal Government, its charter's disclaimer of agency status prevents it from being considered a Government entity inthe present case. This reliance on the statute is misplaced.Section 541 is assuredly dispositive of Amtrak's status as aGovernment entity for purposes of matters that are withinCongress's control--for example, whether it is subject to stat-utes that impose obligations or confer powers upon Government entities, such as the Administrative Procedure Act, 5U. S. C. $ 551 et seq. (1988 ed. and Supp. V), the Federal Advisory Committee Act, 5 U. S. C. App. $ 1 et seq., and the lawsgoverning Government procurement, see 41 U. S. C. $ 5 etseq. (1988 ed. and Supp. V). And even beyond that, we think$ 541 can suffice to deprive Amtrak of all those inherent powers and immunities of Government agencies that it is withinthe power of Congress to eliminate. We have no doubt, forexample, that the statutory disavowal of Amtrak's agencystatus deprives Amtrak of sovereign immunity from suit, seeSentner v. Amtrak, 540 F. Supp. 557, 560 (NJ 1982), and ofthe ordinarily presumed power of Government agencies authorized to incur obligations to pledge the credit of theUnited States, see,e. g., Debt Obligations of Nat. CreditUnion Admin., 6 Op. Off. Legal Counsel 262, 264 (1982).But it is not for Congress to make the final determinationof Amtrak's status as a Government entity for purposes ofdetermining the constitutional rights of citizens affected byits actions. If Amtrak is, by its very nature, what the Con-stitution regards as the Government, congressional pronouncement that it is not such can no more relieve it of itsFirst Amendment restrictions than a similar pronouncementcould exempt the Federal Bureau of Investigation from theFourth Amendment. The Constitution constrains governmental action "by whatever instruments or in whatevermodes that action may be taken."Ex parte Virginia, 100U. S. 339, 346-347 (1880). And under whatever congres513us2$22K 04-01-98 17:46:13 PAGES OPINPGT393Cite as: 513 U. S. 374 (1995)Opinion of the Courtsional label. As we said of the Reconstruction Finance Cor-poration in deciding whether debts owed it were owed theUnited States Government: "That the Congress chose to callit a corporation does not alter its characteristics so as tomake it something other than what it actually is . . . ."Cherry Cotton Mills, Inc. v. United States, 327 U. S. 536,539 (1946).Amtrak points to two of our opinions that characterizeAmtrak as a nongovernmental entity. The first isNationalRailroad Passenger Corporation v. Boston & Maine Corp.,503 U. S. 407, 410 (1992), which describes the corporationas "not an agency or instrumentality of the United StatesGovernment." But the governmental or nongovernmentalnature of Amtrak had no conceivable relevance to the issuesbefore the Court in Boston & Maine. The quoted characterization, similar to that contained in the statute, was merelyset forth at the beginning of the opinion, in describingthe factual background of the case. It is hard to imagineweaker dictum.The second case is National Railroad Passenger Corporation v. Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co., 470 U. S. 451 (1985).There the governmental character of Amtrak was marginally relevant. The railroads opposing Amtrak in the caseargued that a subsequent statute reneging on the Government's own obligations was subject to a "more rigorousstandard of review" under the Due Process Clause than astatute impairing private contractual obligations. Id., at471. The Court said it did not have to consider that question because the contracts in question were "not betweenthe railroads and the United States but simply between therailroads and the nongovernmental corporation, Amtrak."Id., at 470. But it develops, later in the opinion, that theCourt would not have had to consider that question anyway,since it concluded that the contracts (whether those of theUnited States or not) did not incur the obligation alleged.The effect of the apparent reliance upon Amtrak's nongov513us2$22K 04-01-98 17:46:13 PAGES OPINPGT394 LEBRON v. NATIONAL RAILROAD PASSENGERCORPORATIONOpinion of the Courternmental character was at most to enable the Court tomake, later in the opinion, without applying the "more rigorous standard" urged by the railroads, the superfluous argu-ment that "[e]ven were the Court of Appeals correct that therailroads have a private contractual right . . . we disagreewith the Court of Appeals' conclusion that the Due ProcessClause limited Congress' power to [affect that right as itdid]."Id., at 476. Moreover, for the purpose at hand inAtchison it was quite proper for the Court to treat Congress's assertion of Amtrak's nongovernmental status in$ 541 as conclusive. As we have suggested above, even ifAmtrak is a Government entity, $ 541's disavowal of that sta-tus certainly suffices to disable that agency from incurringcontractual obligations on behalf of the United States. Forthese reasons, we think thatAtchison's assumption of Am-trak's nongovernmental status (a point uncontested by theparties in the case, since it was not Amtrak's governmentalcharacter that the railroads relied upon to establish an obligation of the United States) does not bind us here.VThe question before us today is unanswered, therefore, bygoverning statutory text or by binding precedent of thisCourt. Facing the question of Amtrak's status for the firsttime, we conclude that it is an agency or instrumentality ofthe United States for the purpose of individual rights guar-anteed against the Government by the Constitution.This conclusion seems to us in accord with public and judi-cial understanding of the nature of Government-created and-controlled corporations over the years. A remarkable fea-ture of the heyday of those corporations, in the 1930's and1940's, was that, even while they were praised for their sta-tus "as agencies separate and distinct, administratively andfinancially and legally, from the government itself, [which]has facilitated their adoption of commercial methods of accounting and financing, avoidance of political controls, and513us2$22K 04-01-98 17:46:13 PAGES OPINPGT395Cite as: 513 U. S. 374 (1995)Opinion of the Courtutilization of regular procedures of business management,"it was fully acknowledged that they were a "device" of "government," and constituted "federal corporate agencies" apartfrom "regular government departments." Pritchett, 40 Am.Pol. Sci. Rev., at 495. The Reference Manual of GovernmentCorporations, prepared in 1945 by the Comptroller General,contains as one of its Tables "Corporations arranged according to supervising or interested Government department oragency," see GAO Corporation Manual x-xi. This lists the58 then-extant Government corporations under the variousdepartments and agencies, from the Agriculture Departmentto the War Department, and then concludes the list with five"Independent corporations"--analogous, one supposes, to the"independent agencies" of the Executive Branch proper.The whole tenor of the Manual is that these corporations arepart of the Government.This Court has shared that view. For example, in Reconstruction Finance Corporation v. J. G. Menihan Corp., 312U. S. 81 (1941), Chief Justice Hughes, writing for the Court,described the RFC, whose organic statute did not state it tobe a Government instrumentality, as, nonetheless, "a corporate agency of the government," and said that "it acts as agovernmental agency in performing its functions." Id., at83. In Cherry Cotton Mills, Inc. v. United States, 327 U. S.536 (1946), we had little difficulty finding that the RFC was"an agency selected by Government to accomplish purelygovernmental purposes," id., at 539, and was thus entitled tothe benefit of a statute giving the Court of Claims jurisdiction over "counterclaims . . . on the part of the Governmentof the United States," 28 U. S. C. $ 250(2) (1940 ed.). Likewise in Inland Waterways Corp. v. Young, 309 U. S. 517(1940), we found that the Inland Waterways Corporation,which similarly was not specifically designated in its charteras an instrumentality of the United States, see Act of June3, 1924, 43 Stat. 360, was an agency of the United States, sothat its funds were "public moneys" for which national banks513us2$22K 04-01-98 17:46:13 PAGES OPINPGT396 LEBRON v. NATIONAL RAILROAD PASSENGERCORPORATIONOpinion of the Courtcould give security under $ 45 of the National Bank Act of1864, 13 Stat. 113, 309 U. S., at 523-524. Justice Frankfurter wrote for the Court:"So far as the powers of a national bank to pledge itsassets are concerned, the form which Governmenttakes--whether it appears as the Secretary of theTreasury, the Secretary of War, or the Inland Water-ways Corporation--is wholly immaterial. The motiveswhich lead Government to clothe its activities in corpo-rate form are entirely unrelated to the problem of safeguarding governmental deposits . . . ." Id., at 523.Even Congress itself appeared to acknowledge, at leastuntil recent years, that Government-created and -controlledcorporations were part of the Government. The GCCA, discussed above, which brought to an end the era of uncontrolled growth of Government corporations, provided that,without explicit congressional authorization, no corporationshould be acquired or created by "any officer or agency ofthe Federal Government or by any Government corporationfor the purpose of acting as an agency or instrumentalityof the United States . . . ." $ 304(a), 59 Stat. 602 (emphasisadded). That was evidently intended to restrict the cre-ation ofall Government-controlled policy-implementing corporations, and not just some of them. And the companionprovision that swept away many of the extant corporationssaid that no wholly owned government corporation createdunder state law could continue "as an agency or instru-mentality of the United States," $ 304(b), 59 Stat. 602.Once again, that was evidently meant to eliminate policyimplementing government ownership of all state corporations, and not just some of them. From the 1930's onward,many of the statutes creating Government-controlled corporations said explicitly that they were agencies or instrumentalities of the United States, see, e. g., Act of June 9, 1947,$ 1, 61 Stat. 130, as amended, 12 U. S. C. $ 635 (creating the513us2$22K 04-01-98 17:46:13 PAGES OPINPGT397Cite as: 513 U. S. 374 (1995)Opinion of the CourtExport-Import Bank of Washington as "an agency of theUnited States of America"); Federal Crop Insurance Act,$ 503, 52 Stat. 72, 7 U. S. C. $ 1503 (creating Federal CropInsurance Corporation as "an agency of and within the Department of Agriculture"), and until 1962 none said otherwise. As we have described above, moreover, those laterstatutes, relatively few in number, took that statement, perhaps too uncritically, from an earlier statute pertaining toa corporation (Comsat) that wasgenuinely private and notGovernment controlled.That Government-created and -controlled corporations are(for many purposes at least) part of the Government itselfhas a strong basis, not merely in past practice and understanding, but in reason itself. It surely cannot be that government, state or federal, is able to evade the most solemnobligations imposed in the Constitution by simply resortingto the corporate form. On that thesis, Plessy v. Ferguson,163 U. S. 537 (1896), can be resurrected by the simple deviceof having the State of Louisiana operate segregated trainsthrough a state-owned Amtrak. In Pennsylvania v. Boardof Directors of City Trusts of Philadelphia, 353 U. S. 230(1957) (per curiam), we held that Girard College, which hadbeen built and maintained pursuant to a privately erectedtrust, was nevertheless a governmental actor for constitutional purposes because it was operated and controlled by aboard of state appointees, which was itself a state agency.Id., at 231. Amtrak seems to us an a fortiori case.Amtrak was created by a special statute, explicitly for thefurtherance of federal governmental goals. As we havedescribed, six of the corporation's eight externally nameddirectors (the ninth is named by a majority of the board itself) are appointed directly by the President of the UnitedStates--four of them (including the Secretary of Transportation) with the advice and consent of the Senate. See$$ 543(a)(1)(A), (C)-(D). Although the statute restricts mostof the President's choices to persons suggested by certain513us2$22K 04-01-98 17:46:13 PAGES OPINPGT398 LEBRON v. NATIONAL RAILROAD PASSENGERCORPORATIONOpinion of the Courtorganizations or persons having certain qualifications, thoserestrictions have been tailor-made by Congress for this entity alone. They do not in our view establish an absence ofcontrol by the Government as a whole, but rather constitutea restriction imposed by one of the political branches uponthe other. Moreover, Amtrak is not merely in the tempo-rary control of the Government (as a private corporationwhose stock comes into federal ownership might be); it isestablished and organized under federal law for the very purpose of pursuing federal governmental objectives, under thedirection and control of federal governmental appointees.It is in that respect no different from the so-called independent regulatory agencies such as the Federal CommunicationsCommission or the Securities Exchange Commission, whichare run by Presidential appointees with fixed terms. It istrue that the directors of Amtrak, unlike commissioners ofindependent regulatory agencies, are not, by the explicitterms of the statute, removable by the President for cause,and are not impeachable by Congress. But any reduction inthe immediacy of accountability for Amtrak directors vis-a` -vis regulatory commissioners seems to us of minor consequence for present purposes--especially since, by the veryterms of the chartering Act, Congress's "right to repeal,alter, or amend this chapter at any time is expressly reserved." 45 U. S. C. $ 541.Respondent appeals to statements this Court made in acase involving the second Bank of the United States, Bankof United States v. Planters' Bank of Georgia, 9 Wheat.904 (1824). There we allowed the Planters' Bank, in whichthe State of Georgia held a noncontrolling interest, see Actof Dec. 19, 1810, $ 1, reprinted in Digest of Laws of State ofGeorgia 34-35 (O. Prince ed. 1822); Act of Dec. 3, 1811, $ 1,id., at 35, to be sued in federal court despite the EleventhAmendment, reasoning that "[t]he State does not, by becoming a corporator, identify itself with the corporation," 9Wheat., at 907.

S. 374 (1995)Opinion of the Court"held shares in the old Bank of the United States; but theprivileges of the government were not imparted by that circumstance to the bank. The United States was not a partyto suits brought by or against the bank in the sense of theconstitution." Id., at 908. But it does not contradict thosestatements to hold that a corporation is an agency of theGovernment, for purposes of the constitutional obligations ofGovernment rather than the "privileges of the government,"when the State has specifically created that corporation forthe furtherance of governmental objectives, and not merelyholds some shares but controls the operation of the corpora-tion through its appointees.Respondent also invokes our decision in the Regional RailReorganization Act Cases, 419 U. S. 102 (1974), which foundthe Consolidated Rail Corporation, or Conrail, not to be afederal instrumentality, despite the President's power to appoint, directly or indirectly, 8 of its 15 directors. See id., at152, n. 40; Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973, $ 301,87 Stat. 1004. But we specifically observed in that case thatthe directors were placed on the board to protect the UnitedStates' interest "in assuring payment of the obligations guar-anteed by the United States," and that "[f]ull voting control. . . will shift to the shareholders if federal obligations fallbelow 50% of Conrail's indebtedness." 419 U. S., at 152.Moreover, we noted, "[t]he responsibilities of the federal di-rectors are not different from those of the other directors--to operate Conrail at a profit for the benefit of its sharehold-ers," ibid.--which contrasts with the public interest "goals"set forth in Amtrak's charter, see 45 U. S. C. $ 501a. Am-trak is worlds apart from Conrail: The Government exertsits control not as a creditor but as a policymaker, and noprovision exists that will automatically terminate controlupon termination of a temporary financial interest.55 Section 543(c) purports to divide the authority to select seven directorsbetween the common stockholders and the preferred stockholders uponconversion of one-fourth or more of Amtrak's outstanding preferred stock513us2$22K 04-01-98 17:46:13 PAGES OPINPGT400 LEBRON v.

We express no opinion as to whetherAmtrak's refusal to display Lebron's advertisement violatedthat Amendment, but leave it to the Court of Appeals todecide that. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is re-versed, and the case is remanded for further proceedingsconsistent with this opinion. It is so ordered.Justice O'Connor, dissenting.The Court holds that Amtrak is a Government entity andtherefore all of its actions are subject to constitutional challenge. Lebron, however, expressly disavowed this argu-ment below, and consideration of this broad and unexpectedquestion is precluded because it was not presented in thepetition for certiorari. The question on which we grantedcertiorari is narrower: Whether the alleged suppression ofLebron's speech by Amtrak, as a concededly private entity,should be imputed to the Government. Because Amtrak'sdecision to reject Lebron's billboard proposal was a matter ofprivate business judgment and not of Government coercion, Iwould affirm the judgment below.IThis Court's Rule 14.1(a) provides: "Only the questions setforth in the petition, or fairly included therein, will be considered by the Court."

Escondido, 503 U. S. 519, 537-538 (1992)(emphasis deleted). In Yee, we held that a regulatory takingargument, while subsidiary to the umbrella question whethera taking had occurred, was only complementary to the physical taking inquiry set forth in the petition and thus wasbarred under Rule 14.1(a). Seeid., at 535. Here, state action is the umbrella claim. Subsidiary to that claim, butcomplementary to each other, are two distinct questions:whether Amtrak is a Government entity, and whether Am-trak's conduct as a private actor is nevertheless attributableto the Government.We granted certiorari on the following question, set forthin the petition:"Whether the court of appeals erred in holding thatAmtrak's asserted policy barring the display of politicaladvertising messages in Pennsylvania Station, NewYork, was not state action, where:"(a) the United States created Amtrak, endowed itwith governmental powers, owns all its voting stock,and appoints all the members of its Board;"(b) the United States-appointed Board approved theadvertising policy challenged here;"(c) the United States keeps Amtrak afloat every yearby subsidizing its losses; and"(d) Pennsylvania Station was purchased for Amtrakby the United States and is shared with several othergovernmental entities." Pet. for Cert. i.The question asks whether the challenged policy "was notstate action" and therefore may, at first blush, appear topresent the umbrella inquiry. Yee suggests otherwise. Thepetition there recited two decisions by the Courts of Appealsand asked: "Was it error for the state appellate court to dis513us2$22J 04-01-98 17:46:13 PAGES OPINPGT402 LEBRON v. NATIONAL RAILROAD PASSENGERCORPORATIONO'Connor, J., dissentingregard the rulings and hold that there was no taking underthe fifth and fourteenth amendments?" Instead of focusingon whether "there was no taking," we read the question asa whole. Since the decisions by the Courts of Appeals andthe lower court opinion involved only physical takings, weconcluded: "Fairly construed, then, petitioners' question pre-sented is the equivalent of the question, `Did the court belowerr in finding no physical taking?' " 503 U. S., at 537.Just so here. The question asks whether the lower courterred and thus directs our attention to the decisions below.The District Court, in its thorough order, explicitly notedLebron's theory of the case: "Plaintiff does not contend thatAmtrak is a governmental agency. What plaintiff contendsis that the federal government is sufficiently entwined inAmtrak's operations and authority that the particular actions at issue must be deemed governmental action." 811F. Supp. 993, 999 (SDNY 1993). Before the Court of Appeals, in order to distinguish a long line of cases which heldthat Amtrak is not a Government agency, Lebron stated:"Since Lebron does not contend that Amtrak is a governmental entity per se, but rather is so interrelated to stateentities that it should be treated as a state actor here, thesecases are inapposite." Brief for Michael A. Lebron in No.93-7127 (CA2), p. 30, n. 39.The Court of Appeals, like the District Court, substantively discussed only the second question that Lebron argueshere--whether Amtrak's conduct in this case implicates "thepresence of government action in the activities of privateentities." 12 F. 3d 388, 390 (CA2 1993). To introduce itsanalysis, the Court of Appeals did state that "[t]he Rail Passenger Service Act of 1970 . . . created Amtrak as a private,for-profit corporation under the District of Columbia Business Corporation Act," ibid., relying on Congress' characterization of the corporation in 45 U. S. C. $ 541. In so asserting, the Court of Appeals did not " `pas[s] upon' " the questionsuch that it is now a proper basis for reversal, ante, at 379,513us2$22J 04-01-98 17:46:13 PAGES OPINPGT403Cite as: 513 U. S. 374 (1995)O'Connor, J., dissentingbut rather merely identified the question that the court hadto address and focused the inquiry on the precise argumentpresented by Lebron. This observation by the Court of Ap-peals is much like--indeed, much less extensive than--ourdiscussion of Amtrak's status as a private corporation in National Railroad Passenger Corporation v. Atchison, T. & S.F. R. Co., 470 U. S. 451, 453-456 (1985). I agree with theCourt that Atchison does not bind us, ante, at 393-394, but,by the same token, I do not see how the court below couldbe said to have addressed the issue. A passing observationcould not constitute binding precedent; so, too, it could notserve as the basis for reversal.The question set forth in the petition focused on thespecific action by Amtrak, not on the general nature of thecorporation as a private or public entity. Lebron askedwhether "Amtrak's asserted policy barring the display ofpolitical advertising messages in Pennsylvania Station, NewYork, was not state action." App. to Pet. for Cert. i. Thelist that follows this question, while partially concerning Amtrak's nature as an entity, went to support the thrust of thequery, which is whether these enumerated attributes renderAmtrak's advertising policy state action. Lebron's emphasis on the specific action challenged is the crucial differencebetween his alternative arguments for state action. Thefirst inquiry--whether Amtrak is a Government entity--focuses on whether Amtrak is so controlled by the Governmentthat it should be treated as a Government agency, and allof its decisions considered state action. The second inquirytakes Lebron at his word that Amtrak is not a Governmententity and instead focuses on the State's influence on particular actions by Amtrak as a private actor.Fairly construed, the question presented is whether theCourt of Appeals erred in holding that the advertising policyof Amtrak, as a private entity, is not attributable to the Federal Government despite the corporation's links thereto.This question is closely related and complementary to, but513us2$22J 04-01-98 17:46:13 PAGES OPINPGT404 LEBRON v. NATIONAL RAILROAD PASSENGERCORPORATIONO'Connor, J., dissentingcertainly not inclusive of, the question answered by theCourt today, which is whether those links render Amtrak thefunctional equivalent of a Government agency. In my view,the latter question is barred by Rule 14.1(a).Relying on United States Nat. Bank of Ore. v. Independent Ins. Agents of America, Inc., 508 U. S. 439 (1993), theCourt argues that it properly addresses whether Amtrak isa Government entity because that inquiry is "prior to theclearly presented question," namely, whether Amtrak's decision is attributable to the Government. Ante, at 382. Independent Ins. Agents, however, held only that the Court ofAppeals had authority to consider a waived claim sua sponteand did not abuse its discretion in doing so.* That is quitedifferent from the purpose for which the Court now marshalsthe case, which is to justify its consideration of a waivedquestion in the first instance. As explained below, I do notquestion the Court's authority, only its prudence. In anyevent, the dispute in Independent Ins. Agents centered onthe interpretation of a statute that may not have existed,and, as the Court recognizes, ante, at 383, n. 3, the decisionsimply applied the traditional principle that "[t]here can beno estoppel in the way of ascertaining the existence of a law."South Ottawa v. Perkins, 94 U. S. 260, 267 (1877). Here, oneneed not assume the existence of any predicate legal rule toaccept Lebron's word that Amtrak is a private entity.The mere fact that one question must be answered beforeanother does not insulate the former from Rule 14.1(a) andother waiver rules. In Stone v. Powell, 428 U. S. 465 (1976),*The Court would read more into the decision, because we "decline[d]even to brush aside the Court of Appeals' (questionable) contention thatthere was `a "duty" to address the status of section 92,' saying only that`[w]e need not decide' that question." Ante, at 383, n. 3. But by (prudently) reserving the question, the Court could not have implied its answer. And our "complicit[y] in the [Court of Appeals'] enterprise," ibid.,exists only if one indulges in the unlikely inference that we held more thanwhat we said we did.513us2$22J 04-01-98 17:46:13 PAGES OPINPGT405Cite as: 513 U.

Id., at 481, n. 15. We thus recognized thatthose decisions properly avoided the question of cognizabil-ity, which question, of course, is logically anterior to the merits of the Fourth Amendment claims presented. In Steagaldv.United States, 451 U. S. 204, 211 (1981), we held that theGovernment had conceded that the petitioner had a FourthAmendment interest in the searched home, an inquiry thatprecedes the question that was preserved, whether thesearch was reasonable. In Kamen v. Kemper FinancialServices, Inc., 500 U. S. 90, 97, n. 4 (1991), because the question was neither litigated below nor included in the petition,we assumed the existence of a cause of action under $ 20(a)of the Investment Company Act of 1940 before addressingthe requirements of such an action. See also Burks v.Lasker, 441 U. S. 471, 476 (1979) (assuming same). Finally,in McCormick v. United States, 500 U. S. 257 (1991), theCourt held that a state legislator did not violate the antiextortion Hobbs Act, 18 U. S. C. $ 1951, by accepting campaign contributions without an explicit exchange of improperpromises. The Court reached this question only after declining to consider whether the Act applies to local officialsat all, because that question was neither argued below norincluded in the petition for certiorari. McCormick, 500U. S., at 268, n. 6; see also id., at 280 (Scalia, J., concurring)(accepting the assumption, because the argument waswaived, that the Hobbs Act is a "federal `payment for officialaction' statute" even though "I think it well to bear in mindthat the statute may not exist").The Court does not take issue with these cases but arguesfurther that, because the question whether Amtrak is a Government entity is "dependent upon many of the same factualinquiries [as the clearly presented question], refusing to re513us2$22J 04-01-98 17:46:13 PAGES OPINPGT406 LEBRON v. NATIONAL RAILROAD PASSENGERCORPORATIONO'Connor, J., dissentinggard it as embraced within the petition may force us to as-sume what the facts will show to be ridiculous, a risk whichought to be avoided." Ante, at 382. A certain circularityinheres in this logic, because the Court must first answerthe omitted question in order to determine whether itsanswer turns on "the same factual inquiries" as the clearlypresented question. As for the facts, the record is shapedby the parties' arguments below. Perhaps serendipity hasgiven the Court a factual record adequate to decide a question other than that advanced below, but there is no guaran-tee of such convergence. It is rather unfair to hold a partyto a record that it may have developed differently in response to a different theory of the case. It is this risk ofunfairness, rather than the fear of seeming "ridiculous," thatwe should avoid.Rule 14.1(a), of course, imposes only a prudential limitation, but one that we disregard "only in the most exceptionalcases." Stone v. Powell, supra, at 481, n. 15; see also UnitedStates v. Mendenhall, 446 U. S. 544, 551, n. 5 (1980). Thisis not one of them. As noted before, not only did Lebrondisavow the argument that Amtrak is a Government entitybelow, he did so in order to distinguish troublesome cases.Lebron's postpetition attempt to resuscitate the claim thathe himself put to rest is precisely the kind of bait-and-switchstrategy that waiver rules, prudential or otherwise, are supposed to protect against. In Steagald, supra, at 211, forexample, we stated unequivocally that "the Government,through its assertions, concessions, and acquiescence, haslost its right to challenge petitioner's assertion that he possessed a legitimate expectation of privacy in the searchedhome." I see no difference here.The Rule's prudential limitation on our power of reviewserves two important purposes, both of which the Court disserves by deciding that Amtrak is a Government entity.First, the Rule provides notice and enables the respondentto sharpen its arguments in opposition to certiorari. "By513us2$22J 04-01-98 17:46:13 PAGES OPINPGT407Cite as: 513 U. S. 374 (1995)O'Connor, J., dissentingforcing the petitioner to choose his questions at the outset,Rule 14.1(a) relieves the respondent of the expense of unnecessary litigation on the merits and the burden of opposingcertiorari on unpresented questions."Yee, 503 U. S., at 536.Lebron argues that Amtrak has waived its Rule 14.1(a) argument by failing to object in the brief in opposition to certio-rari. But that is exactly the point: The question set forthdid not fairly include an argument that Amtrak is a Govern-ment agency, and, indeed, the petition was devoted towhether Amtrak's private decision should be imputed to theState. Even at pages 16-18, the petition did not "fairly embrac[e] the argument that Lebron now advances," ante, at380, but rather argued that the composition of Amtrak's board"renders an otherwise private entity a state actor," Pet. forCert. 16 (emphasis added)--thus specifically repeating theconcession he now wishes to withdraw. Amtrak could notrespond to a point not argued and did not waive an argumentthat was not at issue. Not until the merits brief did Amtrakhave notice that Lebron would contradict his persistent assertion that the corporation was a private entity.Second, the Rule assists the management of our cases."Rule 14.1(a) forces the parties to focus on the questions theCourt has viewed as particularly important, thus enablingus to make efficient use of our resources." Yee, supra, at536. We normally grant only petitions that present an important question of law on which the lower courts are inconflict. Here, the lower courts have generally held thatAmtrak is not a Government entity, see, e. g., Anderson v.National Railroad Passenger Corporation, 754 F. 2d 202,204 (CA7 1985); Ehm v. National Railroad Passenger Corporation, 732 F. 2d 1250, 1255 (CA5), cert. denied, 469 U. S. 982(1984), and none of our cases suggest otherwise. Evenwhere the lower courts are in clear conflict, we often deferconsideration of novel questions of law to permit further development. Despite the prevalence of publicly owned corporations, whether they are Government agencies is a question513us2$22J 04-01-98 17:46:13 PAGES OPINPGT408 LEBRON v. NATIONAL RAILROAD PASSENGERCORPORATIONO'Connor, J., dissentingseldom answered, and then only for limited purposes. SeeCherry Cotton Mills, Inc. v. United States, 327 U. S. 536, 539(1946); National Railroad Passenger Corporation v. Atchi-son, T. & S. F. R. Co., 470 U. S., at 471. Answering thisquestion today merely opens the back door to prematureadjudication of similarly broad and novel theories in thefuture.Weeding out such endeavors, Rule 14.1(a), like otherwaiver rules, rests firmly upon a limited view of our judicialpower. See,e. g., Carducci v. Regan, 714 F. 2d 171, 177(CADC 1983) (Scalia, J.) ("The premise of our adversarialsystem is that appellate courts do not sit as self-directedboards of legal inquiry and research, but essentially as arbiters of legal questions presented and argued by the partiesbefore them"). "The doctrine of judicial restraint teachesus that patience in the judicial resolution of conflicts maysometimes produce the most desirable result." Stevens,Some Thoughts on Judicial Restraint, 66 Judicature 177, 183(1982). Whether the result of today's decision is desirable Ido not decide. But I think it clear that the Court has exhib-ited little patience in reaching that result.IIAccepting Lebron's concession that Amtrak is a privateentity, I must "traverse th[e] difficult terrain," ante, at 378,that the Court sees fit to avoid, and answer the question thatis properly presented to us: whether Amtrak's decision toban Lebron's speech, although made by a concededly privateentity, is nevertheless attributable to the Government andtherefore considered state action for constitutional purposes.Reflecting the discontinuity that marks the law in this area,we have variously characterized the inquiry as whether"there is a sufficiently close nexus between the State and thechallenged action," Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co., 419U. S. 345, 351 (1974); whether the State, by encouraging thechallenged conduct, could be thought "responsible for those513us2$22J 04-01-98 17:46:13 PAGES OPINPGT409Cite as: 513 U. S. 374 (1995)O'Connor, J., dissentingactions," Blum v. Yaretsky, 457 U. S. 991, 1005 (1982); andwhether "the alleged infringement of federal rights [is]`fairly attributable to the State,' " Rendell-Baker v. Kohn,457 U. S. 830, 838 (1982), quotingLugar v. Edmondson OilCo., 457 U. S. 922, 937 (1982). Whatever the semantic formulation, I remain of the view that the conduct of a privateactor is not subject to constitutional challenge if such conduct is "fundamentally a matter of private choice and notstate action."Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Co., 500U. S. 614, 632 (1991) (O'Connor, J., dissenting).Lebron relies heavily onBurton v. Wilmington ParkingAuthority, 365 U. S. 715 (1961). There, the Court perceiveda symbiotic relationship between a racially segregated restaurant and a state agency from which the restaurant leasedpublic space. Noting that the State stood to profit from thediscrimination, the Court held that the government had "sofar insinuated itself into a position of interdependence with"the private restaurant that it was in effect "a joint participant in the challenged activity." Id., at 725. Focusing onthis language, Lebron argues that various features of Amtrak's structure and management--its statutory genesis, theheavy reliance on federal subsidies, and a board appointedby the President--places it in a symbiotic relationship withthe Government such that the decision to ban Lebron'sspeech should be imputed to the State.Our decision in Burton, however, was quite narrow. Werecognized "the limits of our inquiry" and emphasized thatour decision depended on the "peculiar facts [and] circumstances present." Id., at 726. We have since noted thatBurton limited its "actual holding to lessees of public property," Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co., supra, at 358,and our recent decisions in this area have led commentatorsto doubt its continuing vitality, see, e. g., L. Tribe, AmericanConstitutional Law $ 18-3, p. 1701, n. 13 (2d ed. 1988) ("Theonly surviving explanation of the result in Burton may bethat found in Justice Stewart's concurrence").513us2$22J 04-01-98 17:46:13 PAGES OPINPGT410 LEBRON v. NATIONAL RAILROAD PASSENGERCORPORATIONO'Connor, J., dissentingIn Jackson, we held that a private utility's termination ofservice to a customer is not subject to due process challenge,even though the termination was made pursuant to a statelaw. In doing so, we made clear that the question turns onwhether the challenged conduct results from private choice:"Respondent's exercise of the choice allowed by state lawwhere the initiative comes from it and not from the State,does not make its action in doing so `state action' for pur-poses of the Fourteenth Amendment." 419 U. S., at 357(footnote omitted). The rule applies even where the privateentity makes its decision in an environment heavily regulated by the government. Rendell-Baker, supra, involved aprivate school for troubled students who were transferredthere by authority of a state law, and for whose educationthe State paid the school. Public funds comprised 90% to99% of the school budget. The school fired petitioners, anda state grievance board reviewed that personnel action. Despite the school's pervasive ties to the State, we held thatthe discharge decisions were not subject to constitutionalchallenge because those actions "were not compelled or eveninfluenced by any state regulation." Id., at 841. We notedthat "in contrast to the extensive regulation of the schoolgenerally, the various regulators showed relatively little interest in the school's personnel matters." Ibid. Likewise,in Blum v. Yaretsky, supra, we held that the decisions of aregulated hospital to discharge its patients were not subjectto constitutional challenge. Although various Medicaid regulations and benefit adjustment procedures may have encouraged the hospital's decisions to discharge its patientsearly, we held that the State was not "responsible for thoseactions" because such actions "ultimately turn on medicaljudgments made by private parties according to professionalstandards that are not established by the State." Id., at1005, 1008. See also San Francisco Arts & Athletics, Inc.v. United States Olympic Comm., 483 U. S. 522, 547 (1987)("There is no evidence that the Federal Government coerced513us2$22J 04-01-98 17:46:13 PAGES OPINPGT411Cite as: 513 U. S. 374 (1995)O'Connor, J., dissentingor encouraged the USOC in the exercise of its right [to denyuse of its copyright]").These cases differ markedly from the "interdependence"or "joint participation" analysis ofBurton and stand forthe principle that, unless the government affirmativelyinfluenced or coerced the private party to undertake thechallenged action, such conduct is not state action for constitutional purposes. Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Co.,supra, is not to the contrary. In that case, the Court heldthat a private attorney's exercise of a peremptory challengeis attributable to the government and therefore subject toconstitutional inquiry. Although the opinion cited Burton,see 500 U. S., at 621, 624, it emphasized that a private partyexercising a peremptory challenge enjoys the "overt, significant assistance of the court," id., at 624. The decisiontherefore is an application of Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U. S. 1,19 (1948), which focused on the use of the State's coercivepower, through its courts, to effect the litigant's allegedlyunconstitutional choice. Moreover, Edmonson stressed thata litigant exercising a peremptory challenge performs a "traditional function of the government," 500 U. S., at 624, a theory of state action established by Marsh v. Alabama, 326U. S. 501 (1946), that is independent from Burton and notrelevant to this case.Relying thus on Shelley and Marsh, Edmonson did notnecessarily extend the "interdependence" rationale of Burton beyond the limited facts of that case. Given the pervasive role of government in our society, a test of state actionpredicated upon public and private "interdependence"sweeps much too broadly and would subject to constitutionalchallenge the most pedestrian of everyday activities, a problem that the Court recognized in Burton itself, see 365 U. S.,at 725-726. A more refined inquiry is that established byJackson, Rendell-Baker, Blum, and San Francisco Arts &Athletics: The conduct of a private entity is not subject toconstitutional scrutiny if the challenged action results from513us2$22J 04-01-98 17:46:13 PAGES OPINPGT412 LEBRON v. NATIONAL RAILROAD PASSENGERCORPORATIONO'Connor, J., dissentingthe exercise of private choice and not from state influenceor coercion.Applying this principle to the facts before us, I see nobasis to impute to the Government Amtrak's decision todisapprove Lebron's advertisement. Although a number offactors indicate the Government's pervasive influence inAmtrak's management and operation, none suggest that theGovernment had any effect on Amtrak's decision to turndown Lebron's proposal. The advertising policy that allegedly violates the First Amendment originated with a prede-cessor to Amtrak, the wholly private Pennsylvania RailroadCompany. A 1967 lease by that company, for example, prohibited "any advertisement which in the judgement of Licensor is or might be deemed to be slanderous, libelous, unlawful, immoral, [or] offensive to good taste . . . ." App. 326,|| 19. Amtrak simply continued this policy after it took over.The specific decision to disapprove Lebron's advertising wasmade by Amtrak's Vice President of Real Estate and Operations Development, who, as a corporate officer, was neitherappointed by the President nor directed by the Presidentappointed board to disapprove Lebron's proposal.Lebron nevertheless contends that the board, through itsapproval of the advertising policy, controlled the adverse action against him. This contention rests on the faulty premise that Amtrak's directors are state actors simply becausethey were appointed by the President; it assumes that theboard members sit as public officials and not as businessdirectors, thus begging the question whether Amtrak is aGovernment agency or a private entity. In any event, evenaccepting Lebron's premise that the board's approval hasconstitutional significance, the factual record belies his contention. The particular lease that permitted Amtrak to disallow Lebron's billboard was neither reviewed nor approveddirectly by the board. In fact, minutes of meetings datingback to 1985 showed that the board approved only one contract between Amtrak and Transportation Displays, Incor513us2$22J 04-01-98 17:46:13 PAGES OPINPGT413Cite as: 513 U. S. 374 (1995)O'Connor, J., dissentingporated, the billboard leasing company that served as Am-trak's agent, and even then it is not clear whether the boardapproved the contract or merely delegated authority to exe-cute the licensing agreement. App. 402. In short, nothingin this case suggests that the Government controlled, co-erced, or even influenced Amtrak's decision, made pursuantto corporate policy and private business judgment, to disap-prove the advertisement proposed by Lebron.Presented with this question, the Court of Appeals prop-erly applied our precedents and did not impute Amtrak's decision to the Government. I would affirm on this basis andnot reverse the Court of Appeals based on a theory that isforeign to this case. Respectfully, I dissent.513us2$23Q 01-04-97 17:58:05 PAGES OPINPGT414 OCTOBER TERM, 1994SyllabusMILWAUKEE BREWERY WORKERS' PENSIONPLANv. JOS. SCHLITZ BREWING CO. et al.certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe seventh circuitNo. 93-768. Argued December 5, 1994--Decided February 21, 1995The Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980 (MPPAA), 29U. S. C. $$ 1381-1461, permits an employer withdrawing from an underfunded multiemployer pension plan to "amortize" the charge it is required to pay to cover its fair share of the plan's unfunded liabilities bymaking installment payments to the plan. Following the August 14,1981, withdrawal of respondent Schlitz from petitioner multiemployerpension plan (Plan), a dispute arose as to when, for purposes of calculating Schlitz's amortization schedule, interest began to accrue on the company's withdrawal charge. The Plan claimed that accrual began on thelast day of the plan year preceding withdrawal, December 31, 1980, the"valuation date" as of which the withdrawal charge was determined.Schlitz, however, argued for January 1, 1982, the first day of the planyear following withdrawal. Under the Plan's reading, Schlitz's last annual installment would be substantially greater than it would underSchlitz's own reading. The District Court disagreed with Schlitz, butthe Court of Appeals reversed.Held: MPPAA calculates its installment schedule on the assumption thatinterest begins accruing on the first day of the plan year following withdrawal. Pp. 421-431.(a) For computation purposes, $ 1399(c)(1)(A)(i)--which (the partiesagree) governs this case and which authorizes an employer "to amortizethe [withdrawal] amount in . . . annual payments . . . , calculated as ifthe first payment were made on the first day of the plan year followingthe plan year in which the withdrawal occurs and as if each subsequentpayment were made on the first day of each subsequent plan year"--causes interest to accrue over subsequent plan years, but not during thewithdrawal year itself. Although the statute does not mention interestdirectly, the word "amortize" assumes interest charges. However, theword does not indicate that interest accrues during the withdrawal year.One generally does not pay interest on a debt of the kind here at issueuntil that debt arises--i. e., until its principal is outstanding. Underthe statute, the withdrawing employer's debt does not arise at the endof the year preceding the year of withdrawal. Rather, $ 1399(c)(1)(A)(i)'s instruction to calculate payments as if the "first payment" were513us2$23Q 01-04-97 17:58:05 PAGES OPINPGT415Cite as: 513 U. S. 414 (1995)Opinion of the Courtmade on the "first day" of the year following withdrawal demonstratesthat the debt must be treated as if it arose at that time. The Plan'scontrary reading of the statute cannot be easily reconciled with statutory provisions permitting an employer to pay the amount owed in alump sum and thereby avoid paying amortization interest, $ 1399(c)(4),and defining a withdrawing employer's basic liability without referenceto interest during the withdrawal year, $$ 1381(b)(1), 1391. Pp. 422-425.(b) The several arguments of the Plan and its amici--(1) that allowing a withdrawing employer to avoid interest during the withdrawalyear works against the statute's basic objective of requiring the employer to pay a fair share of the plan's underfunding; (2) that the statute's language actually favors calculating interest from the last day ofthe plan year before withdrawal; and (3) that the legislative historydemonstrates that Congress expressly rejected the idea of a "fundinggap" between the valuation date at the end of the plan year beforewithdrawal and the beginning of the year following withdrawal--arenot persuasive.

Thiscase focuses upon a withdrawing employer who amortizesthe charge, and it asks when, for purposes of calculating theamortization schedule, interest begins to accrue on the amortized charge. The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuitheld that, for purposes of computation, interest begins to accrue on the first day of the year after withdrawal. We agreeand affirm its judgment.IWe shall briefly describe the general purpose of MPPAA,the basic way MPPAA works, and the relevant interestrelated facts of the case before us.AMPPAA's General PurposeMPPAA helps solve a problem that became apparent afterCongress enacted the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 88 Stat. 829, 29 U. S. C. $ 1001 etseq. ERISA helped assure private-sector workers that theywould receive the pensions that their employers had promised them. See, e. g., Concrete Pipe & Products of Cal., Inc.v. Construction Laborers Pension Trust for Southern Cal.,508 U. S. 602, 605-609 (1993). To do so, among other things,ERISA required employers to make contributions thatwould produce pension plan assets sufficient to meet futurevested pension liabilities; it mandated termination insuranceto protect workers against a plan's bankruptcy; and, if a planbecame insolvent, it held any employer who had withdrawnfrom the plan during the previous five years liable for a fairshare of the plan's underfunding. See 26 U. S. C. $ 412 (minimum funding standards); 29 U. S. C. $ 1082 (same); 29 U. S. C.$ 1301 et seq. (termination insurance); 29 U. S. C. $ 1364 (withdrawal liability).Unfortunately, this scheme encouraged an employer towithdraw from a financially shaky plan and risk paying itsshare if the plan later became insolvent, rather than to re513us2$23Q 01-04-97 17:58:05 PAGES OPINPGT417Cite as: 513 U. S. 414 (1995)Opinion of the Courtmain and (if others withdrew) risk having to bear alone theentire cost of keeping the shaky plan afloat. Consequently,a plan's financial troubles could trigger a stampede for theexit doors, thereby ensuring the plan's demise. See Connolly v. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, 475 U. S.211, 216 (1986);Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation v.R. A. Gray & Co., 467 U. S. 717, 722-723, n. 2 (1984); see also29 U. S. C. $ 1001a(a)(4); H. R. Rep. No. 96-869, pt. 1,pp. 54-55 (1980); D. McGill & D. Grubbs, Fundamentals ofPrivate Pensions 618-619 (6th ed. 1989). MPPAA helpedeliminate this problem by changing the strategic considerations. It transformed what was only a risk (that a with-drawing employer would have to pay a fair share of underfunding) into a certainty. That is to say, it imposed awithdrawal charge on all employers withdrawing from anunderfunded plan (whether or not the plan later becameinsolvent). And, it set forth a detailed set of rules fordetermining, and collecting, that charge.BMPPAA's Basic ApproachThe way in which MPPAA calculates interest is related tothe way in which that statute answers three more general,and more important, questions: First, how much is the with-drawal charge? MPPAA's lengthy charge-determinationsection, $ 1391, sets forth rules for calculating a withdraw-ing employer's fair share of a plan's underfunding. See29 U. S. C. $ 1391. It explains (a) how to determine a plan'stotal underfunding; and (b) how to determine an employer'sfair share (based primarily upon the comparative number ofthat employer's covered workers in each earlier year and therelated level of that employer's contributions).One might expect $ 1391 to calculate a withdrawal chargethat equals the withdrawing employer's fair share of a plan'sunderfundingas of the day the employer withdraws. But,instead, $ 1391 instructs a plan to make the withdrawal513us2$23Q 01-04-97 17:58:05 PAGES OPINPGT418 MILWAUKEE BREWERY WORKERS' PENSION PLAN v.JOS. SCHLITZ BREWING CO.Opinion of the Courtcharge calculation, not as of the day of withdrawal, but as ofthe last day of the plan year preceding the year duringwhich the employer withdrew--a day that could be up to ayear earlier. See $$ 1391(b)(2)(A)(ii), (b)(2)(E)(i), (c)(2)(C)(i),(c)(3)(A), and (c)(4)(A). Thus (assuming for illustrative purposes that a plan's bookkeeping year and the calendar yearcoincide), the withdrawal charge for an employer withdrawing from an underfunded plan in 1981 equals that employer'sfair share of the underfunding as calculated on December 31,1980, whether the employer withdrew the next day (January1, 1981) or a year later (December 31, 1981). The reason forthis calculation date seems one of administrative convenience. Its use permits a plan to base the highly complexcalculations upon figures that it must prepare in any eventfor a report required under ERISA, see 29 U. S. C. $ 1082(c)(9), thereby avoiding the need to generate new figures tiedto the date of actual withdrawal.Second, how may the employer pay the withdrawalcharge? The statute sets forth two methods: (a) payment ina lump sum; and (b) payment in installments. The statute'slump-sum method is relatively simple. A withdrawing employer may pay the entire liability when the first paymentfalls due; pay installments for a while and then discharge itsremaining liability; or make a partial balloon payment andafterwards pay installments. See 29 U. S. C. $ 1399(c)(4).The statute's installment method is more complex. Thestatutory method is unusual in that the statute does not askthe question that a mortgage borrower would normally ask,namely, what is the amount of each of my monthly payments?What size monthly payment will amortize, say, a 7% 30-yearloan of $100,000? Rather, the statute fixes the amount ofeach payment and asks how many such payments there willhave to be. To put the matter more precisely, (1) the statutefixes the amount of each annual payment at a level that(roughly speaking) equals the withdrawing employer's typical contribution in earlier years; (2) it sets an interest rate,513us2$23Q 01-04-97 17:58:05 PAGES OPINPGT419Cite as: 513 U. S. 414 (1995)Opinion of the Courtequal to the rate the plan normally uses for its calculations;and (3) it then asks how many such annual payments it willtake to "amortize" the withdrawal charge at that interestrate. 29 U. S. C. $$ 1399(c)(1)(A)(i), (c)(1)(A)(ii), (c)(1)(C).It is as if Brown, who owes Smith $1,000, were to ask, not,"How much must I pay each month to pay off the debt (with7% interest) over two years?"--but, rather, "Assuming 7%interest, how many $100 monthly payments must I make topay off that debt?" To bring the facts closer to those of thiscase, assume that an employer withdraws from an under-funded plan in mid-1981; that the withdrawal charge (calculated as of the end of 1980) is $23.3 million; that the employernormally contributes about $4 million per year to the plan;and that the plan uses a 7% interest rate. In that case, thestatute asks: "How many annual payments of about $4 million does it take to pay off a debt of $23.3 million if the interest rate is 7%?" The fact that the statute poses theinstallment-plan question in this way, along with an additional feature of the statute, namely, that the statute forgivesall debt outstanding after 20 years, 29 U. S. C. $ 1399(c)(1)(B),suggests that maintaining level funding for the plan is animportant goal of the statute. The practical effect of thisconcern with maintaining level payments is that any amortization interest $ 1399(c)(1)(A)(i) may cause to accrue is addedto the end of the payment schedule (unless forgiven by$ 1399(c)(1)(B)).Third, when must the employer pay? The statute couldnot make the employer pay the calculated sum (or begin topay that sum) on the date in reference to which one calculates the withdrawal charge, for that date occurs before theemployer withdraws. (It is the last day of the precedingplan year, i. e., December 31, 1980, for an employer who withdraws in 1981.) The statute, of course, might make thewithdrawing employer pay (or begin payment) on the datethe employer actually withdraws. But, it does not do so.Rather, the statute says that a plan must draw up a schedule513us2$23Q 01-04-97 17:58:05 PAGES OPINPGT420 MILWAUKEE BREWERY WORKERS' PENSION PLAN v.JOS. SCHLITZ BREWING CO.Opinion of the Courtfor payment and "demand payment" as "soon as practicable"after withdrawal. 29 U. S. C. $ 1399(b)(1). It adds that"[w]ithdrawal liability shall be payable . . . no more than 60days after the date of the demand." $ 1399(c)(2).Thus, a plan that calculates quickly might demand payment the day after withdrawal and make the charge "payable" within 60 days thereafter. A plan that calculatesslowly might not be able to demand payment for manymonths after withdrawal. For example, in the case of theemployer who withdraws on August 14, 1981, incurring awithdrawal charge of $23.3 million (calculated as of December 31, 1980), the lump sum of $23.3 million, or the first ofthe installment payments of roughly $4 million, will become"payable" to the plan "no later than 60 days" after the plansent the withdrawing employer a demand letter. The dayof the first payment may thus come as soon as within 60 daysafter August 15, 1981, or it may not come for many monthsthereafter, depending upon the plan's calculating speed.CThis CaseThe facts of this case approximate those of our example.Three brewers, Schlitz, Pabst, and Miller, contributed formany years to a multiemployer pension plan (Plan). On August 14, 1981, Schlitz withdrew from the Plan. See App.151-152. By the end of September 1981, the Plan completedits calculations, created a payment schedule, and sent out ademand for payment (thereby making the first installmentpayment "payable") "on or before November 1, 1981." Id.,at 153, 154. From the outset, the parties agreed that theannual installment payment amounted to $3,945,481, and thatthe relevant interest rate was 7% per year. After variouscontroversies led to arbitration and a court proceeding between Schlitz and the Plan, the courts and parties eventuallydetermined that the withdrawal charge (calculated as of the513us2$23Q 01-04-97 17:58:05 PAGES OPINPGT421Cite as: 513 U. S. 414 (1995)Opinion of the Courtlast day of the previous plan-bookkeeping year, December 31,1980) amounted to $23.3 million.But the parties disagreed whether interest accrued during1981, the year in which Schlitz withdrew. The Plan claimedthat, for purposes of calculating the installment schedule, interest started accruing on the last day of the plan year preceding withdrawal (December 31, 1980). Schlitz, on theother hand, argued that accrual began on the first day of theplan year following withdrawal (January 1, 1982). Undereither reading, the number of annual payments is eight.But, under the Plan's reading, the final payment wouldamount to $3,499,361, whereas, in Schlitz's reading, that payment would amount to $880,331.The arbitrator in this case agreed with Schlitz's reading.See 9 EBC 2385, 2405 (1988). The District Court, reviewingthe arbitration award, disagreed, No. 88-C-908 (ED Wis.,June 6, 1991), reprinted in App. 25, 62-69, but the Court ofAppeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed the District Court,3 F. 3d 994 (1993). Because the Seventh Circuit's decisionconflicts with a holding of the Third Circuit, Huber v. Casablanca Industries, Inc., 916 F. 2d 85, 95-100 (1990), cert.dism'd, 506 U. S. 1088 (1993), this Court granted certiorari,512 U. S. 1234 (1994). Our conclusion, like that of the Seventh Circuit, is that, for purposes of computation, interestdoes not start accruing until the beginning of the plan yearafter withdrawal.IIAt first glance, the statutory provision that (the partiesagree) governs this case seems silent on the issue ofwithdrawal-year interest. Indeed, it does not mention interest directly at all. Rather, it says that a withdrawingemployer"shall pay the amount determined under section 1391 . . .over the period of years necessary to amortize theamount in level annual payments determined under sub513us2$23Q 01-04-97 17:58:05 PAGES OPINPGT422 MILWAUKEE BREWERY WORKERS' PENSION PLAN v.JOS. SCHLITZ BREWING CO.Opinion of the Courtparagraph (C), calculated as if the first payment weremade on the first day of the plan year following theplan year in which the withdrawal occurs and as if eachsubsequent payment were made on the first day of eachsubsequent plan year." 29 U. S. C. $ 1399(c)(1)(A)(i)(emphasis added).After considering the parties' arguments, which focus uponthe emphasized language, we have become convinced that,for purposes of computation, this provision, although causinginterest to accrue over subsequent plan years, does not causeinterest to accrue during the withdrawal year itself.AThe Plan points out, and we agree, that the word "amor-tize" normally assumes interest charges. After all, the veryidea of amortizing, say, a mortgage loan, involves paying theprincipal of the debt over time along with interest. But thePlan (supported by the Government, which is taking a viewof the matter contrary to the view the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation took in the Huber case, see 916 F. 2d, at96) goes on to claim that the word "amortize" indicates thatinterest accrues during the withdrawal year as well as dur-ing subsequent years. We do not agree with that claim. Inour view, one generally does not pay interest on a debt untilthat debt arises--that is to say, until the principal of the debtis outstanding. And the instruction to calculate payment asif the first payment were made at the beginning of the following year tells us to treat the debt as if it arose at thattime (i. e., the first day of the year after withdrawal), not asif it arose one year earlier.For one thing, unless a loan is involved, one normally expects a debtor to make a first payment at the time the debtarises, not one payment cycle later. Suppose, for example,that a taxpayer arranges to pay a large tax debt in four quar-terly installments. Would one not expect the taxpayer tomake the first payment on April 15, the day the tax debt513us2$23Q 01-04-97 17:58:05 PAGES OPINPGT423Cite as: 513 U. S. 414 (1995)Opinion of the Courtbecomes due? Similarly, would one not expect a buyer of,say, a business to make the first payment (a down payment)at the time of the closing? By way of contrast, when a loanis involved (say, when one borrows money on a home mortgage and repays it in installments), interest accrual normallydoes begin before the first payment. That is because theborrower has had the use of the money for one cycle beforethe first payment. In the case of a loan, it would seem pointless, and would simply generate an unnecessary back-andforth transfer of money, for a first repayment to take placeon the very day the lender disburses the loan proceeds.The "first payment" at issue here, however, looks more likea tax or purchase-money installment than a loan installment.Under the statute, the withdrawing employer's debt does notarise at the end of the year preceding the year of withdrawal.In fact, the employer may not have withdrawn from the planat the beginning of the year, but instead may have continuedto make its ordinary contribution until well into the year.In any event, the statute makes clear that the withdrawingemployer owes nothing until its plan demands payment,which will inevitably happen some time after the beginningof the year. See 29 U. S. C. $$ 1399(b)(1), (c)(2). In fact, thewithdrawing employer cannot determine, or pay, the amountof its debt until the plan has calculated that amount--whichmust take place some time after the beginning of the withdrawal year. All these features make it difficult to find anyanalogy in withdrawal liability to a loan.For another thing, we cannot easily reconcile the Plan'sreading of the statute with the statutory provision that permits an employer to pay the amount owed in a lump sum.That provision says that a withdrawing employer"shall be entitled to prepay the outstanding amount ofthe unpaid annual withdrawal liability payments determined under [$ 1399(c)(1)(C)], plus accrued interest, ifany, in whole or in part, without penalty." $ 1399(c)(4).513us2$23Q 01-04-97 17:58:05 PAGES OPINPGT424 MILWAUKEE BREWERY WORKERS' PENSION PLAN v.JOS. SCHLITZ BREWING CO.Opinion of the CourtWe read this provision to permit an employer, by payinga lump sum, to avoid paying the amortization interest that$ 1399(c)(1)(A)(i) would otherwise cause to accrue. (Underany other reading, the prepayment provision would not create much of an "entitle[ment]." Moreover, the prepaymentprovision refers to "payments determined under [$ 1399(c)(1)(C)]"--not $ 1399(c)(1)(A), the provision that causes amortization interest to accrue.) It would seem odd if the prepay-ment provision enabled an employer to avoid all interest except the interest accruing during the year of withdrawal.And, if interest accrued from the last day of the year beforewithdrawal, there would hardly ever be a time that no interest was due. Such a reading would thus make it very difficult to give meaning to the words "if any" in the phrase "plusaccrued interest, if any." (The Third Circuit suggested thatthese words might refer to a lump-sum payment made immediately after a scheduled installment. See Huber, 916 F. 2d,at 99. We agree that they could, theoretically. But, realistically speaking, it seems unlikely that Congress inserted "ifany" to deal with such an unusual event.)Further, the interpretation under which interest would accrue from the last day of the year before withdrawal is difficult to reconcile with the statutory language that defines awithdrawing employer's basic liability. Section 1381(a) saysthat the withdrawing employer becomes "liable to the plan inthe amount determined under this part to be the withdrawalliability." Section 1381(b)(1) defines "withdrawal liability"as "the amount determined under section 1391." Yet, $ 1391says nothing about a year's worth of interest. Why thenread the provision here at issue so that it inevitably and always creates liability in the amount of the withdrawal chargeplus one year's interest, irrespective of when the employer,in fact, withdraws and how or when the employee beginsto pay?Finally, the provision here at issue asks one to calculatethe installment payments as if the "first payment" was made,513us2$23Q 01-04-97 17:58:05 PAGES OPINPGT425Cite as: 513 U. S. 414 (1995)Opinion of the Courtnot on the last day of the withdrawal year, but on the "firstday" of the next year, i. e., one year plus one day after thewithdrawal charge calculation date. This choice of time (ayear and a day) would be an odd way to signal that one is totreat the first payment as if it occurred at the end of a cycle.BThe Plan (and supporting amici) make several argumentsin support of a reading in which, for purposes of calculation,interest starts accruing on the last day of the year beforewithdrawal. But we are not persuaded.First, the Plan argues that our interpretation worksagainst the basic objective of the statute, requiring a withdrawing employer to pay a fair share of the underfunding.Under our interpretation, says the Plan, the withdrawingemployer will fail to pay a year's worth of interest on thewithdrawal charge, thereby requiring the remaining employers to make up what, in fact, was part of the withdrawingemployer's fair share. Suppose, for example, that an underfunded plan needed exactly $20 million as of the end of 1980to create a sum that would grow to just the amount neededto pay then-vested benefits falling due, say, in 1999. By theend of 1981 that same plan would need more money; indeed,if we assume the $20 million would have grown 7% each year,it would need 7% more to pay those same vested 1999 benefits. Thus, if the withdrawing employer's fair share of the$20 million is $3 million as of the end of 1980, its fair sharemust have grown to $3,210,000 by the end of 1981. Why,asks the Plan, should the remaining employers have to makeup for this missing $210,000?One answer to the Plan's question is that the $210,000 willnot necessarily be missing. For one thing, until the em-ployer withdraws, it will be required to make contributionsthat should contain a component designed to reduce under-funding. See 26 U. S. C. $ 412(b)(2); 29 U. S. C. $ 1082. Foranother thing, if a plan moves quickly, it may be able to force513us2$23Q 01-04-97 17:58:05 PAGES OPINPGT426 MILWAUKEE BREWERY WORKERS' PENSION PLAN v.JOS. SCHLITZ BREWING CO.Opinion of the Courta withdrawing employer to begin making installment pay-ments even before the end of the withdrawal year. Eitherway, to charge such an employer a full year's worth of inter-est would overcharge that employer and thereby provide theremaining employers with a kind of underfunding-reductionwindfall.Another answer is that we are not convinced that MPPAAaims to make withdrawing employers pay an actuarially per-fect fair share, namely, a set of payments in amounts that,when invested, would theoretically produce (on the plan's ac-tuarial assumptions) a sum precisely sufficient to pay (theemployer's proportional share of) a plan's estimated vestedfuture benefits. For one thing, the statute forgives de minimis amounts. See 29 U. S. C. $ 1389. For another thing, itforgives all annual installment payments after 20 years, see$ 1399(c)(1)(B)--and that means that, if an employer's normalannual contribution was low compared to the withdrawalcharge, the presence or absence of withdrawal-year interest(which shows up at the end of the payment schedule, seesupra, at 419) will make no difference (for the last paymentswill never be made). Finally, in making the first installment"payable" only after a plan demands it, MPPAA contemplates that an employer sometimes may pay its actual firstinstallment long after the withdrawal year--as was the casein Huber, supra, at 88 (21/2-year delay)--in which case nointerpretation of the statute can avoid an employer's actuallypaying something less than its fair share of interest.Second, the Plan argues that the statute's language favorsits interpretation. It refers to a dictionary that defines anamortization plan as " `one where there are partial paymentsof the principal, and accrued interest, at stated periods fora definite time, at the expiration of which the entire indebtedness will be extinguished,' " Brief for Petitioner 27 (quoting Black's Law Dictionary 76 (5th ed. 1979)) (emphasisadded), and to another definition that says that, " `[i]f a loanis being repaid by the amortization method, each payment513us2$23Q 01-04-97 17:58:05 PAGES OPINPGT427Cite as: 513 U. S. 414 (1995)Opinion of the Courtis partially repayment of principal and partially payment ofinterest,' " Brief for Petitioner 27 (quoting S. Kellison, TheTheory of Interest 169 (2d ed. 1991)) (emphasis added).These definitions accurately describe the repayment of loans.But, they do not seem to focus upon whether or not onewould normally include interest in the first installment of anamortized payment of a debt that is not a loan. We have noreason to believe they intend to define away the issue beforeus here.The Plan adds that our reading of the statute makes thefirst "as if " clause in $ 1399(c)(1)(A)(i) superfluous because,"if Congress had not intended to include interest in the firstpayment, it could have simply provided that the presumedpayment schedule should be calculated as if payments weremade annually." Brief for Petitioner 38. It seems to usthat the premise of this argument is that, without contraryindication, one would expect that, in the case of an indebtedness of the kind here at issue, interest would not start accruing before the first payment is due--a premise with whichwe agree, see supra, at 422-423. More importantly, hadCongress not used the words "as if the first payment weremade on the first day of the plan year following the planyear in which the withdrawal occurs," the reader might havethought that interest would begin to accrue immediatelyupon withdrawal, a reading that has some intuitive appeal,see 3 F. 3d, at 1004 ("An assessment of interest between thedate of withdrawal and the date on which payments begin. . . would not be troubling"). But, the first "as if " clausemakes clear that interest does not begin accruing on thatdate. (The same concern may explain the second "as if "clause in $ 1399(c)(1)(A)(i), concerning subsequent payments.Without that clause, one might think that one should calculate the amortization schedule as if the first payment is madeout of order, and as if each successive payment is made onthe anniversary of the date of withdrawal.)513us2$23Q 01-04-97 17:58:05 PAGES OPINPGT428 MILWAUKEE BREWERY WORKERS' PENSION PLAN v.JOS. SCHLITZ BREWING CO.Opinion of the CourtWe recognize that Congress might have been more specific. For example, it could have said: "Calculate amortization as if the first payment is made on the date the employer's withdrawal liability is due" (had it intended interest tostart accruing on that date); or: "Calculate amortization as ifeach payment is made on the last day of the year at thebeginning of which it is due" (had it intended interest tostart accruing one cycle before the first payment is due). Instead, Congress said that one should calculate amortization"as if the first payment were made on the first day of theplan year following the plan year in which the withdrawaloccurs." And, that actual language, as we have said, offersmore support for our interpretation than for the alternative.Were we to read the actual language as does the Plan, wewould have to analogize the valuation date (the last day ofthe year preceding withdrawal) to the date on which liabilityarises; to the date on which the debt becomes "payable"; orto the date on which the employer withdraws. But, in fact,the calculation date is none of those things; it is a date chosensimply for ease of administration; and ease of administrationdoes not require choosing the same date for interest-accrualpurposes. See 3 F. 3d, at 1004 ("Establishing a simple rulefor calculating funding shortfalls has nothing to do withinterest").Third, the Plan points to legislative history. The Plansays that the original bill provided that interest would notbegin accruing until the date of withdrawal. And, the Planpoints out, just like the version that ultimately became law,the bill located the valuation date (the date as of which thewithdrawing employer's share in the plan's underfunding isdetermined) at the end of the plan year before withdrawal.Thus, the Plan says, the original bill contemplated a "fundinggap"--from the valuation date to the withdrawal date. Because the section providing that interest started accruing onthe withdrawal date did not make it into the statute as en513us2$23Q 01-04-97 17:58:05 PAGES OPINPGT429Cite as: 513 U. S. 414 (1995)Opinion of the Courtacted, the Plan argues, Congress expressly rejected the ideaof a "gap." Brief for Petitioner 41.For the reasons stated above, see supra, at 426-427, wedoubt that our reading, as a practical matter, will cause asignificant gap to occur. But, regardless, if we were to consider legislative history in this case, we would find that itundermines, rather than supports, the Plan's reading. ThePlan's rendering is incomplete, for the relevant statutoryprovisions went through not two but four versions:(1) the original bill, calling for a valuation on the last dayof the year before withdrawal and for interest accrualbeginning on the date of withdrawal,see S. 1076, 96th Cong., 1st Sess., $ 104 (1979) (adding ERISA $$ 4201(d)(1)(A), (e)(5)), reprinted in 125Cong.

No. 96-869,pt. 2, pp. 129-131, 135-136 (1980); and(4) a final version, which moved the valuation date backto the end of the year preceding withdrawal but retained the third version's interest-accrual language,see H. R. 3904, 96th Cong., 1st Sess., $ 104 (1980)(adding ERISA $$ 4211(b)(2)(E)(i), (c)(2)(C)(i)(I),(c)(3)(A), (c)(4)(A)(i), 4219(c)(1)(A)(i)), reprinted in126 Cong. Rec. 23003, 23014, 23016 (1980).This history suggests two things, neither of which helpsthe Plan. First, throughout the bill's history, the valuationdate and interest-accrual date moved about in an apparentlyuncoordinated way. This somewhat undermines the Plan'ssuggestion that Congress was very concerned about theinterplay between the two. It certainly dispels the notionthat the final version should primarily be viewed as a rejection of the "funding gap" found in the original bill. Second,the evolution of the "as if " clause from "as if each paymentwere made at the end of the year in which it is due" to "asif the payment were made on the first day of the plan year[following withdrawal]" suggests that Congress replaced ascheme in which interest starts accruing a full payment cyclebefore the first payment with a scheme in which interest starts accruing on the first day of the year followingwithdrawal.513us2$23Q 01-04-97 17:58:05 PAGES OPINPGT431Cite as: 513 U.
