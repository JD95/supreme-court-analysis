We must determine in this case whether Congress has au-thorized the Secretary of Transportation to appoint civilianmembers of the Coast Guard Court of Criminal Appeals, andif so, whether this authorization is constitutional under theAppointments Clause of Article II.IThe Coast Guard Court of Criminal Appeals (formerlyknown as the Coast Guard Court of Military Review) is anintermediate court within the military justice system. It isone of four military Courts of Criminal Appeals; others existfor the Army, the Air Force, and the Navy-Marine Corps.The Coast Guard Court of Criminal Appeals hears appealsfrom the decisions of courts-martial, and its decisions aresubject to review by the United States Court of Appeals forthe Armed Forces (formerly known as the United StatesCourt of Military Appeals).1Appellate military judges who are assigned to a Court ofCriminal Appeals must be members of the bar, but may becommissioned officers or civilians. Art. 66(a), Uniform Codeof Military Justice (UCMJ), 10 U. S. C. $ 866(a). During thetimes relevant to this case, the Coast Guard Court of Crimi-nal Appeals has had two civilian members, Chief Judge Joseph H. Baum and Associate Judge Alfred F. Bridgman, Jr.These judges were originally assigned to serve on the courtby the General Counsel of the Department of Transportation,1 The names of the Courts of Military Review and of the United StatesCourt of Military Appeals were changed, effective October 5, 1994, by Pub.L. 103-337, $ 924, 108 Stat. 2831.520US2 Unit: $U56 [09-10-99 19:44:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN654 EDMOND v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtwho is, ex officio, the Judge Advocate General of the CoastGuard, Art. 1(1), UCMJ, 10 U. S. C. $ 801(1). Subsequentevents, however, called into question the validity of theseassignments.In Weiss v. United States, 510 U. S. 163 (1994), we considered whether the assignment of commissioned militaryofficers to serve as military judges without reappointmentunder the Appointments Clause was constitutional. Weheld that military trial and appellate judges are officers ofthe United States and must be appointed pursuant to theAppointments Clause.Id., at 170. We upheld the judicialassignments at issue in Weiss because each of the militaryjudges had been previously appointed by the President as acommissioned military officer, and was serving on activeduty under that commission at the time he was assigned toa military court. We noted, however, that "allowing civilians to be assigned to Courts of Military Review, withoutbeing appointed pursuant to the Appointments Clause, obviously presents a quite different question." Id., at 170, n. 4.In anticipation of our decision in Weiss, Chief Judge Baumsent a memorandum to the Chief Counsel of the Coast Guardrequesting that the Secretary, in his capacity as a department head, reappoint the judges so the court would be constitutionally valid beyond any doubt. See United States v.Senior, 36 M. J. 1016, 1018 (C. G. C. M. R. 1993). On January15, 1993, the Secretary of Transportation issued a memorandum "adopting" the General Counsel's assignments to theCoast Guard Court of Military Review "as judicial appointments of my own." The memorandum then listed the namesof "[t]hose judges presently assigned and appointed by me,"including Chief Judge Baum and Judge Bridgman. Addendum to Brief for Petitioners A6.Two Terms ago, in Ryder v. United States, 515 U. S. 177(1995), we considered the validity of a conviction that hadbeen affirmed by a panel of the Coast Guard Court of Military Review, including its two civilian members, before the520US2 Unit: $U56 [09-10-99 19:44:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN655Cite as: 520 U. S. 651 (1997)Opinion of the Courtsecretarial appointments of January 15, 1993. The Government conceded that the civilian judges of the Court of Military Review had not been appointed pursuant to the Appointments Clause, see Brief for United States in Ryder v.United States, O. T. 1994, No. 94-431, p. 9, n. 9, but arguedthat Ryder's conviction should be affirmed notwithstandingthis defect. We disagreed, holding that Ryder was "entitledto a hearing before a properly appointed panel of " the CoastGuard Court of Military Review. 515 U. S., at 188. We didnot consider the validity of convictions affirmed by the courtafter the secretarial appointments.Each of the petitioners in the present case was convictedby court-martial. In each case the conviction and sentencewere affirmed, in whole or in part, by the Coast Guard Courtof Criminal Appeals (or its predecessor the Court of MilitaryReview) after the January 15, 1993, secretarial appointments. Chief Judge Baum participated in each decision, andJudge Bridgman participated in the appeals involving two ofthe petitioners. The Court of Appeals for the Armed Forcesaffirmed the convictions, relying on its holding on remand inUnited States v. Ryder, 44 M. J. 9 (1996), that the Secretaryof Transportation's appointments were valid and cured thedefect that had previously existed. 45 M. J. 19 (1996); 44M. J. 273 (1996); 44 M. J. 272 (1996). Petitioners sought review in a consolidated petition pursuant to this Court's Rule12.4, and we granted certiorari, 519 U. S. 977 (1996).IIPetitioners argue that the Secretary's civilian appointments to the Coast Guard Court of Criminal Appeals areinvalid for two reasons: First, the Secretary lacks authorityunder 49 U. S. C. $ 323(a) to appoint members of the court;second, judges of military Courts of Criminal Appeals areprincipal, not inferior, officers within the meaning of the Appointments Clause, and must therefore be appointed by the520US2 Unit: $U56 [09-10-99 19:44:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN656 EDMOND v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtPresident with the advice and consent of the Senate. Weconsider these contentions in turn.Congress has established the Coast Guard as a militaryservice and branch of the Armed Forces that, except in timeof war (when it operates as a service within the Navy),is part of the Department of Transportation. 14 U. S. C.$$ 1-3. The Secretary of Transportation has broad author-ity over the Coast Guard, including the power to "promulgate such regulations and orders as he deems appropriate tocarry out the provisions of [Title 14] or any other law applicable to the Coast Guard," $ 633. The Commandant of theCoast Guard is required to "carry out duties and powers prescribed by the Secretary of Transportation," and he "reportsdirectly to the Secretary." 49 U. S. C. $ 108(b). Most relevant to the present case, $ 323(a) provides: "The Secretaryof Transportation may appoint and fix the pay of officers andemployees of the Department of Transportation and mayprescribe their duties and powers." Petitioners do notdispute that judges of the Coast Guard Court of CriminalAppeals are officers of the Department of Transportation.Thus, although the statute does not specifically mentionCoast Guard judges, the plain language of $ 323(a) appearsto give the Secretary power to appoint them.Petitioners argue, however, that $ 323(a) is a default statute, applicable only where Congress has not otherwise pro-vided for the appointment of specific officers. Petitionerscontend that Article 66(a) of the UCMJ, 10 U. S. C. $ 866(a),gives the Judge Advocate General of each military branchexclusive authority to appoint judges of his respective Courtof Criminal Appeals. That provision reads as follows:"Each Judge Advocate General shall establish a Courtof Criminal Appeals which shall be composed of one ormore panels, and each such panel shall be composed ofnot less than three appellate military judges. . . . Appellate military judges who are assigned to a Court of520US2 Unit: $U56 [09-10-99 19:44:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN657Cite as: 520 U. S. 651 (1997)Opinion of the CourtCriminal Appeals may be commissioned officers or civil-ians, each of whom must be a member of a bar of a Federal court or of the highest court of a State. The JudgeAdvocate General shall designate as chief judge one ofthe appellate military judges of the Court of CriminalAppeals established by him. The chief judge shall determine on which panels of the court the appellatejudges assigned to the court will serve and which military judge assigned to the court will act as senior judgeon each panel."Were we to accept petitioners' interpretation of Article66(a) as providing for the "appointment" of Court of CriminalAppeals judges, their argument that Congress intended it tobe the exclusive means of appointment might prove persuasive. Ordinarily, where a specific provision conflicts with ageneral one, the specific governs.Busic v. United States,446 U. S. 398, 406 (1980). Conspicuously absent from Article66(a), however, is any mention of the "appointment" of mili-tary judges. Instead, the statute refers to judges "who areassigned to a Court of Criminal Appeals" (emphasis added).The difference between the power to "assign" officers to aparticular task and the power to "appoint" those officers isnot merely stylistic. InWeiss, we upheld the assignment ofmilitary officers to serve on military courts because they hadpreviously been "appointed" as officers of the United Statespursuant to the Appointments Clause, and because Congresshad not designated the position of a military judge as onerequiring reappointment. 510 U. S., at 176. We noted inWeiss that Congress has consistently used the word "ap-point" with respect to military positions requiring a separateappointment, rather than using terms not found within theAppointments Clause, such as "assign": "Congress repeatedly and consistently distinguished between an office thatwould require a separate appointment and a position or dutyto which one could be `assigned' or `detailed' by a superior520US2 Unit: $U56 [09-10-99 19:44:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN658 EDMOND v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtofficer." Id., at 172. We found it significant that the sec-tions of the UCMJ relating to military judges "speak explicitly and exclusively in terms of `detail' or `assign'; nowherein these sections is mention made of a separate appointment." Ibid. This analysis suggests that Article 66(a) con-cerns not the appointment of Court of Criminal Appealsjudges, but only their assignment.Moreover, we see no other way to interpret Article 66(a)that would make it consistent with the Constitution. Underthe Appointments Clause, Congress could not give the JudgeAdvocates General power to "appoint" even inferior officersof the United States; that power can be conferred only uponthe President, department heads, and courts of law. Thus,petitioners are asking us to interpret Article 66(a) in a manner that would render it clearly unconstitutional--which wemust of course avoid doing if there is another reasonable interpretation available. NLRB v. Catholic Bishop of Chi-cago, 440 U. S. 490, 500 (1979); Blodgett v. Holden, 275 U. S.142 (1927). Petitioners respond that reading $ 323(a) topermit the Secretary to appoint Court of Criminal Appealsjudges causes us unnecessarily to reach the constitutionalquestion whether those judges are inferior officers under theAppointments Clause, since Congress may vest only theappointment of inferior officers in a department head. Buta constitutional question confronted in order to preserve,if possible, a congressional enactment is not a constitutionalquestion confronted unnecessarily.We conclude that Article 66(a) does not give Judge Advocates General authority to appoint Court of CriminalAppeals judges; that $ 323(a) does give the Secretary ofTransportation authority to do so; and we turn to the con-stitutional question whether this is consistent with the Appointments Clause. IIIThe Appointments Clause of Article II of the Constitutionreads as follows:520US2 Unit: $U56 [09-10-99 19:44:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN659Cite as: 520 U. S. 651 (1997)Opinion of the Court"[The President] shall nominate, and by and with theAdvice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of thesupreme Court, and all other Officers of the UnitedStates, whose Appointments are not herein otherwiseprovided for, and which shall be established by Law: butthe Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of suchinferior Officers, as they think proper, in the Presidentalone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Depart-ments." U. S. Const., Art. II, $ 2, cl. 2.As we recognized in Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 125(1976)(per curiam), the Appointments Clause of Article IIis more than a matter of "etiquette or protocol"; it is amongthe significant structural safeguards of the constitutionalscheme. By vesting the President with the exclusive powerto select the principal (noninferior) officers of the UnitedStates, the Appointments Clause prevents congressional encroachment upon the Executive and Judicial Branches. Seeid., at 128-131; Weiss, supra, at 183-185 (Souter, J., concur-ring); Freytag v. Commissioner, 501 U. S. 868, 904, and n. 4(1991) (Scalia, J., concurring). This disposition was also de-signed to assure a higher quality of appointments: The Framers anticipated that the President would be less vulnerableto interest-group pressure and personal favoritism thanwould a collective body. "The sole and undivided responsi-bility of one man will naturally beget a livelier sense of duty,and a more exact regard to reputation." The FederalistNo. 76, p. 387 (M. Beloff ed. 1987) (A. Hamilton); accord, 3J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the UnitedStates 374-375 (1833). The President's power to select principal officers of the United States was not left unguarded,however, as Article II further requires the "Advice and Consent of the Senate." This serves both to curb Executiveabuses of the appointment power, see 3 Story, supra, at 376-377, and "to promote a judicious choice of [persons] for fillingthe offices of the union," The Federalist No. 76, at 386-387.520US2 Unit: $U56 [09-10-99 19:44:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN660 EDMOND v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtBy requiring the joint participation of the President and theSenate, the Appointments Clause was designed to ensurepublic accountability for both the making of a bad appointment and the rejection of a good one. Hamilton observed:"The blame of a bad nomination would fall upon thepresident singly and absolutely. The censure of rejecting a good one would lie entirely at the door of the senate; aggravated by the consideration of their havingcounteracted the good intentions of the executive. Ifan ill appointment should be made, the executive fornominating, and the senate for approving, would participate, though in different degrees, in the opprobrium anddisgrace." Id., No. 77, at 392.See also 3 Story, supra, at 375 ("If [the President] should . . .surrender the public patronage into the hands of profligatemen, or low adventurers, it will be impossible for him longto retain public favour").The prescribed manner of appointment for principal officers is also the default manner of appointment for inferiorofficers. "[B]ut," the Appointments Clause continues, "theCongress may by Law vest the Appointment of such inferiorOfficers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in theCourts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments." This provision, sometimes referred to as the "Excepting Clause," wasadded to the proposed Constitution on the last day of theGrand Convention, with little discussion. See 2 M. Farrand,Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, pp. 627-628 (1911ed.). As one of our early opinions suggests, its obvious purpose is administrative convenience, see United States v. Germaine, 99 U. S. 508, 510 (1879)--but that convenience wasdeemed to outweigh the benefits of the more cumbersomeprocedure only with respect to the appointment of "inferiorOfficers." Section 323(a), which confers appointment powerupon the Secretary of Transportation, can constitutionally be520US2 Unit: $U56 [09-10-99 19:44:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN661Cite as: 520 U. S. 651 (1997)Opinion of the Courtapplied to the appointment of Court of Criminal Appealsjudges only if those judges are "inferior Officers."Our cases have not set forth an exclusive criterion for dis-tinguishing between principal and inferior officers for Appointments Clause purposes. Among the offices that wehave found to be inferior are that of a district court clerk,Ex parte Hennen, 13 Pet. 225, 258 (1839), an election supervisor, Ex parte Siebold, 100 U. S. 371, 397-398 (1880), a viceconsul charged temporarily with the duties of the consul,United States v. Eaton, 169 U. S. 331, 343 (1898), and a"United States commissioner" in district court proceedings,Go-Bart Importing Co. v. United States, 282 U. S. 344, 352-354 (1931). Most recently, in Morrison v. Olson, 487 U. S.654 (1988), we held that the independent counsel created byprovisions of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, 28U. S. C. $$ 591-599, was an inferior officer. In reaching thatconclusion, we relied on several factors: that the independentcounsel was subject to removal by a higher officer (the Attorney General), that she performed only limited duties, thather jurisdiction was narrow, and that her tenure was limited.487 U. S., at 671-672.Petitioners are quite correct that the last two of these conclusions do not hold with regard to the office of militaryjudge at issue here. It is not "limited in tenure," as thatphrase was used in Morrison to describe "appoint[ment] essentially to accomplish a single task [at the end of which] theoffice is terminated." Id., at 672. Nor are military judges"limited in jurisdiction," as used in Morrison to refer to thefact that an independent counsel may investigate and prosecute only those individuals, and for only those crimes, thatare within the scope of jurisdiction granted by the specialthree-judge appointing panel. See Weiss, 510 U. S., at 192(Souter, J., concurring). However, Morrison did not purport to set forth a definitive test for whether an office is"inferior" under the Appointments Clause. To the contrary,it explicitly stated: "We need not attempt here to decide ex520US2 Unit: $U56 [09-10-99 19:44:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN662 EDMOND v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtactly where the line falls between the two types of officers,because in our view [the independent counsel] clearly fallson the `inferior officer' side of that line." 487 U. S., at 671.To support principal-officer status, petitioners emphasizethe importance of the responsibilities that Court of CriminalAppeals judges bear. They review those court-martial pro-ceedings that result in the most serious sentences, includingthose "in which the sentence, as approved, extends to death,dismissal . . . , dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge, orconfinement for one year or more." Art. 66(b)(1), UCMJ,10 U. S. C. $ 866(b)(1). They must ensure that the courtmartial's finding of guilt and its sentence are "correct in lawand fact," id., Art. 66(c), $ 866(c), which includes resolution ofconstitutional challenges. And finally, unlike most appellatejudges, Court of Criminal Appeals judges are not requiredto defer to the trial court's factual findings, but may independently "weigh the evidence, judge the credibility of witnesses, and determine controverted questions of fact, recognizing that the trial court saw and heard the witnesses."Ibid. We do not dispute that military appellate judges arecharged with exercising significant authority on behalf of theUnited States. This, however, is also true of offices that wehave held were "inferior" within the meaning of the Appointments Clause. See, e. g., Freytag v. Commissioner, 501U. S., at 881-882 (special trial judges having "significan[t] . . .duties and discretion" are inferior officers). The exercise of"significant authority pursuant to the laws of the UnitedStates" marks, not the line between principal and inferiorofficer for Appointments Clause purposes, but rather, as wesaid in Buckley, the line between officer and nonofficer. 424U. S., at 126.Generally speaking, the term "inferior officer" connotes arelationship with some higher ranking officer or officersbelow the President: Whether one is an "inferior" officer depends on whether he has a superior. It is not enough thatother officers may be identified who formally maintain a520US2 Unit: $U56 [09-10-99 19:44:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN663Cite as: 520 U. S. 651 (1997)Opinion of the Courthigher rank, or possess responsibilities of a greater magnitude. If that were the intention, the Constitution mighthave used the phrase "lesser officer." Rather, in the contextof a Clause designed to preserve political accountability relative to important Government assignments, we think itevident that "inferior officers" are officers whose work isdirected and supervised at some level by others who wereappointed by Presidential nomination with the advice andconsent of the Senate.This understanding of the Appointments Clause conformswith the views of the first Congress. On July 27, 1789, Congress established the first Executive department, the Department of Foreign Affairs. In so doing, it expressly designated the Secretary of the Department as a "principalofficer," and his subordinate, the Chief Clerk of the Department, as an "inferior officer:"Section 1. Be it enacted . . . That there shall be anExecutive department, to be denominated the Department of Foreign Affairs, and that there shall be a principal officer therein, to be called the Secretary for theDepartment of Foreign Affairs, who shall perform andexecute such duties as shall from time to time be enjoined on or intrusted to him by the President of theUnited States, agreeable to the Constitution, relative to[matters respecting foreign affairs]; and furthermore,that the said principal officer shall conduct the businessof the said department in such manner as the Presidentof the United States shall from time to time order orinstruct."Sec. 2. And be it further enacted, That there shallbe in the said department, an inferior officer, to be appointed by the said principal officer, and to be employedtherein as he shall deem proper, and to be called thechief Clerk in the Department of Foreign Affairs. . . ."Ch. 4, 1 Stat. 28.520US2 Unit: $U56 [09-10-99 19:44:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN664 EDMOND v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtCongress used similar language in establishing the Depart-ment of War, repeatedly referring to the Secretary of thatdepartment as a "principal officer," and the Chief Clerk, whowould be "employed" within the Department as the Secretary "shall deem proper," as an "inferior officer." Ch. 7,1 Stat. 49.Supervision of the work of Court of Criminal Appealsjudges is divided between the Judge Advocate General (whoin the Coast Guard is subordinate to the Secretary of Trans-portation) and the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces.The Judge Advocate General exercises administrative oversight over the Court of Criminal Appeals. He is chargedwith the responsibility to "prescribe uniform rules of proce-dure" for the court, and must "meet periodically [with otherJudge Advocates General] to formulate policies and proce-dure in regard to review of court-martial cases." Art. 66(f),UCMJ, 10 U. S. C. $ 866(f). It is conceded by the partiesthat the Judge Advocate General may also remove a Court ofCriminal Appeals judge from his judicial assignment withoutcause. The power to remove officers, we have recognized,is a powerful tool for control. Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U. S.714, 727 (1986); Myers v. United States, 272 U. S. 52 (1926).The Judge Advocate General's control over Court of Criminal Appeals judges is, to be sure, not complete. He may notattempt to influence (by threat of removal or otherwise) theoutcome of individual proceedings, Art. 37, UCMJ, 10U. S. C. $ 837, and has no power to reverse decisions of thecourt. This latter power does reside, however, in anotherExecutive Branch entity, the Court of Appeals for theArmed Forces.2 That court reviews every decision of the2 Article 141 of the UCMJ, 10 U. S. C. $ 941, states that the Court ofAppeals for the Armed Forces "is established under article I of the Constitution," and "is located for administrative purposes only in the Department of Defense." Although the statute does not specify the court's "location" for nonadministrative purposes, other provisions of the UCMJ makeclear that it is within the Executive Branch. The court reviews the judg520US2 Unit: $U56 [09-10-99 19:44:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN665Cite as: 520 U. S. 651 (1997)Opinion of the CourtCourts of Criminal Appeals in which: (a) the sentence ex-tends to death; (b) the Judge Advocate General orders suchreview; or (c) the court itself grants review upon petition ofthe accused. Id., Art. 67(a), $ 867(a). The scope of reviewis narrower than that exercised by the Court of CriminalAppeals: so long as there is some competent evidence in therecord to establish each element of the offense beyond a rea-sonable doubt, the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forceswill not reevaluate the facts. Id., Art. 67(c), $ 867(c); UnitedStates v. Wilson, 6 M. J. 214 (C. M. A. 1979). This limitationupon review does not in our opinion render the judges ofthe Court of Criminal Appeals principal officers. What issignificant is that the judges of the Court of Criminal Ap-peals have no power to render a final decision on behalf ofthe United States unless permitted to do so by other Execu-tive officers.Finally, petitioners argue that Freytag v. Commissioner,501 U. S. 868 (1991), which held that special trial judgescharged with assisting Tax Court judges were inferior offi-cers and could be appointed by the Chief Judge of the TaxCourt, suggests that Court of Criminal Appeals judgesare principal officers. Petitioners contend that Court ofCriminal Appeals judges more closely resemble Tax Courtjudges--who we implied (according to petitioners) wereprincipal officers--than they do special trial judges. Wenote initially that Freytag does not hold that Tax Courtjudges are principal officers; only the appointment of specialtrial judges was at issue in that case. Moreover, there aretwo significant distinctions between Tax Court judges andCourt of Criminal Appeals judges. First, there is no Execuments of only military tribunals, id., Art. 67, $ 867; its judges must meetannually in committee with the Judge Advocates General and two members appointed by the Secretary of Defense to survey the operation of themilitary justice system, id., Art. 146, $ 946; and the President may removeits judges for neglect of duty, misconduct, or mental or physical disability,id., Art. 142(c), $ 942(c).520US2 Unit: $U56 [09-10-99 19:44:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN666 EDMOND v.

S. C. $ 7482. And second, there is no officercomparable to a Judge Advocate General who supervises thework of the Tax Court, with power to determine its procedural rules, to remove any judge without cause, and to orderany decision submitted for review.Freytag does not controlour decision here.* * *We conclude that 49 U. S. C. $ 323(a) authorizes the Secre-tary of Transportation to appoint judges of the Coast GuardCourt of Criminal Appeals; and that such appointment is inconformity with the Appointments Clause of the Constitution, since those judges are "inferior Officers" within themeaning of that provision, by reason of the supervision overtheir work exercised by the General Counsel of the Depart-ment of Transportation in his capacity as Judge AdvocateGeneral and the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces.The judicial appointments at issue in this case are thereforevalid.Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Ap-peals for the Armed Forces with respect to each petitioner.
