In his petition for a writ of habeas corpus, Randy G. Spencer seeks to invalidate a September 24, 1992, order revokinghis parole. Because Spencer has completed the entire termof imprisonment underlying the parole revocation, we mustdecide whether his petition is moot.IOn October 17, 1990, petitioner began serving concurrent3-year sentences in Missouri on convictions of felony stealingand burglary. On April 16, 1992, he was released on parole,but on September 24, 1992, the Missouri Board of Probationand Parole, after hearing, issued an Order of Revocation revoking the parole. The order concluded that petitioner hadviolated three of the conditions, set forth in Missouri's Codeof Regulations, Title 14, $ 80-3.010 (1992), that a Missouriinmate must comply with in order to remain on parole:"NOW, THEREFORE, after careful consideration of evidence presented, said charges which warrant revocationare sustained, to wit:*A brief of amici curiae was filed for the State of California et al. byDaniel E.

App.55-56.The specific conduct that violated these conditions was de-scribed only by citation of the parole violation report thatthe board used in making its determination: "Evidence reliedupon for violation is from the Initial Violation Report dated7-27-92." Id., at 56.That report, prepared by State Probation and Parole Officer Jonathan Tintinger, summarized a June 3, 1992, policereport prepared by the Kansas City, Missouri Police Department, according to which a woman had alleged that petitioner, after smoking crack cocaine with her at a local crackhouse and later at his own home, pressed a screwdriveragainst her side and raped her. According to the KansasCity report, petitioner had admitted smoking crack cocainewith the woman, but claimed that the sexual intercourse between them had been consensual. Officer Tintinger's reportthen described his own interview with petitioner, at whichpetitioner again admitted smoking crack cocaine with thewoman, denied that he had pressed a screwdriver to her side,and did not respond to the allegation of rape. Finally, afternoting that "Spencer [was] a registered sex offender, havingbeen given a five-year prison sentence for Sodomy in 1983,"id., at 75, Officer Tintinger's report tentatively recommended that petitioner's parole be continued, but that he be523US1 Unit: $U30 [05-01-00 12:15:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN5Cite as: 523 U. S. 1 (1998)Opinion of the Courtplaced in a drug treatment center. The report withheldmaking "an ultimate recommendation based on the alleged[rape and dangerous weapon] violations" until the prosecut-ing attorney's office had a chance to dispose of those charges.Id., at 76. "In the event formal charges are ultimatelyfiled," it said, "a separate recommendation will be forthcom-ing."Ibid. Petitioner was never charged, but a September14, 1992, followup report prepared by Institutional ParoleOfficer Peggy McClure concluded that "there [did] appear tobe significant evidence that Spencer ha[d] violated the condi-tions of his parole as stated," and recommended that petitioner's parole be revoked. Id., at 64. Officer McClure'sreport is not mentioned in the Order of Revocation.On being returned to prison, petitioner began his effortsto invalidate the Order of Revocation. He first sought reliefin the Missouri courts, but was rejected by the Circuit Courtof De Kalb County, the Missouri Court of Appeals, and, finally, the Missouri Supreme Court. Then, on April 1, 1993,just over six months before the expiration of his 3-year sentence, petitioner filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus,see 28 U. S. C. $ 2254, in the United States District Court forthe Western District of Missouri, alleging that he had notreceived due process in the parole revocation proceedings.11 Specifically, according to petitioner's brief, he contended:"1. The Board denied him his right to a preliminary revocation hearingon the armed criminal action accusation. . . ."2. The Board denied him a hearing on the cancellation of his conditionalrelease date."3. The Board . . . :"a. . . . denied him the right to confront and cross-examine any of thewitnesses against him. . . ."b. . . . gave him no notice that the entire case for revoking his parolewould be the out-of-court statements in the violation report."c. . . . denied him the right to representation by a person of his choice."4.

KEMNAOpinion of the CourtOver petitioner's objections, the District Court granted theState two requested extensions of time to respond to thepetition, deferring the deadline from June 2, 1993, until July7, 1993. On July 14, 1993, after receiving the State's response, petitioner filed a lengthy "Motion and Request forFinal Disposition of this Matter," in which he requested thatthe District Court expedite decision on his case in order toprevent his claim from becoming moot. Before the DistrictCourt responded to this motion, however, on August 7, 1993,petitioner was re-released on parole, and, two months afterthat, on October 16, 1993, the term of his imprisonment expired. On February 3, 1994, the District Court "noted" petitioner's July motion, stating that "[t]he resolution of this casewill not be delayed beyond the requirements of this Court'sdocket." App. 127. Then, on August 23, 1995, the DistrictCourt dismissed petitioner's habeas petition. "Because," itsaid, "the sentences at issue here have expired, petitioner isno longer `in custody' within the meaning of 28 U. S. C.$ 2254(a), and his claim for habeas corpus relief is moot."Id., at 130.The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuitaffirmed the District Court's judgment,2 concluding that,under our decision in Lane v. Williams, 455 U. S. 624, 632(1982), petitioner's claim had become moot because he suffered no "collateral consequences" of the revocation order.91 F. 3d 1114 (1996). (It acknowledged that this interpretation of Lane did not accord with that of the Second and NinthCircuits in United States v. Parker, 952 F. 2d 31 (CA2 1991),statement within ten working days from the date of the decision." SeeBrief for Petitioner 5-6.2 By the time the case reached the Eighth Circuit, petitioner was onceagain in prison, this time serving a 7-year sentence for attempted felonystealing. He is still there, and the State informs us that he is scheduledto be released on parole on January 24, 1999.

Wegranted certiorari. 520 U. S. 1165 (1997).IIThe District Court's conclusion that Spencer's release fromprison caused his petition to be moot because it no longersatisfied the "in custody" requirement of the habeas statutewas in error. Spencer was incarcerated by reason of theparole revocation at the time the petition was filed, which isall the "in custody" provision of 28 U. S. C. $ 2254 requires.See Carafas v. LaVallee, 391 U. S. 234, 238 (1968); Maleng v.Cook, 490 U. S. 488, 490-491 (1989) (per curiam). The moresubstantial question, however, is whether petitioner's subsequent release caused the petition to be moot because it nolonger presented a case or controversy under Article III, $ 2,of the Constitution. "This case-or-controversy requirementsubsists through all stages of federal judicial proceedings,trial and appellate. . . . The parties must continue to have a`personal stake in the outcome' of the lawsuit."Lewis v.Continental Bank Corp., 494 U. S. 472, 477-478 (1990). Seealso Preiser v. Newkirk, 422 U. S. 395, 401 (1975). Thismeans that, throughout the litigation, the plaintiff "musthave suffered, or be threatened with, an actual injury trace-able to the defendant and likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision." Lewis, supra, at 477.An incarcerated convict's (or a parolee's) challenge to thevalidity of his conviction always satisfies the case-or-controversy requirement, because the incarceration (or therestriction imposed by the terms of the parole) constitutes aconcrete injury, caused by the conviction and redressable byinvalidation of the conviction. Once the convict's sentencehas expired, however, some concrete and continuing injuryother than the now-ended incarceration or parole--some"collateral consequence" of the conviction--must exist if thesuit is to be maintained. See, e. g., Carafas, supra, at 237-523US1 Unit: $U30 [05-01-00 12:15:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN8 SPENCER v. KEMNAOpinion of the Court238. In recent decades, we have been willing to presumethat a wrongful criminal conviction has continuing collateralconsequences (or, what is effectively the same, to count col-lateral consequences that are remote and unlikely to occur).See Sibron v. New York, 392 U. S. 40, 55-56 (1968).The present petitioner, however, does not attack his con-victions for felony stealing and burglary, which he concedeswere lawful; he asserts only the wrongful termination ofhis parole status. The reincarceration that he incurred asa result of that action is now over, and cannot be undone.Subsistence of the suit requires, therefore, that continuing"collateral consequences" of the parole revocation be eitherproved or presumed. And the first question we confront iswhether the presumption of collateral consequences which isapplied to criminal convictions will be extended as well torevocations of parole. To answer that question, it is helpfulto review the origins of and basis for the presumption.Originally, we required collateral consequences of conviction to be specifically identified, and we accepted as sufficientto satisfy the case-or-controversy requirement only concretedisadvantages or disabilities that had in fact occurred, thatwere imminently threatened, or that were imposed as a matter of law (such as deprivation of the right to vote, to holdoffice, to serve on a jury, or to engage in certain businesses).Thus, in St. Pierre v. United States, 319 U. S. 41 (1943) (percuriam), one of the first cases to recognize collateral consequences of conviction as a basis for avoiding mootness, werefused to allow St. Pierre's challenge to a contempt citationafter he had completed his 5-month sentence, because "petitioner [has not] shown that under either state or federal lawfurther penalties or disabilities can be imposed on him as aresult of the judgment which has now been satisfied," id., at43. We rejected St. Pierre's argument that the possibilitythat "the judgment [could] impair his credibility as [a] witness in any future legal proceeding" was such a penalty ordisability, because "the moral stigma of a judgment which no523US1 Unit: $U30 [05-01-00 12:15:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN9Cite as: 523 U. S. 1 (1998)Opinion of the Courtlonger affects legal rights does not present a case or contro-versy for appellate review."Ibid. Similarly, in Carafas v.LaVallee, we permitted an individual to continue his chal-lenge to a criminal conviction only after identifying specific,concrete collateral consequences that attached to the conviction as a matter of law:"It is clear that petitioner's cause is not moot. In conse-quence of his conviction, he cannot engage in certainbusinesses; he cannot serve as an official of a labor unionfor a specified period of time; he cannot vote in any election held in New York State; he cannot serve as a juror."391 U. S., at 237 (footnotes and citation omitted).See also Fiswick v. United States, 329 U. S. 211, 221-223(1946) (conviction rendered petitioner liable to deportationand denial of naturalization, and ineligible to serve on a jury,vote, or hold office); United States v. Morgan, 346 U. S. 502(1954) (conviction had been used to increase petitioner's current sentence under state recidivist law); Parker v. Ellis, 362U. S. 574, 576 (1960) (Harlan, J., concurring) (since petitioner's other, unchallenged convictions took away the same civilrights as the conviction under challenge, the challenge wasmoot); Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U. S. 629, 633, n. 2 (1968)(conviction rendered petitioner liable to revocation of his license to operate luncheonette business). Cf. Tannenbaumv. New York, 388 U. S. 439 (1967) (per curiam); Jacobs v. NewYork, 388 U. S. 431 (1967) (per curiam).The gateway to abandonment of this fastidious approachto collateral consequences wasPollard v. United States, 352U. S. 354 (1957). There, in allowing a convict who had already served his time to challenge the length of his sentence,we said, almost offhandedly, that "[t]he possibility of consequences collateral to the imposition of sentence [was] sufficiently substantial to justify our dealing with the merits,"id., at 358--citing for that possibility an earlier case involving consequences for an alien (which there is no reason to523US1 Unit: $U30 [05-01-00 12:15:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN10 SPENCER v. KEMNAOpinion of the Courtbelieve Pollard was), see Pino v. Landon, 349 U. S. 901(1955). In Sibron v. New York, we relied upon this opinionto support the conclusion that our jurisprudence had "aban-doned all inquiry into the actual existence of collateral consequences and in effect presumed that they existed." 392U. S., at 55 (citingPollard, supra).3 Thereafter, and in sum-mary fashion, we proceeded to accept the most generalizedand hypothetical of consequences as sufficient to avoid moot-ness in challenges to conviction. For example, in Evitts v.Lucey, 469 U. S. 387 (1985), we held that respondent's habeaschallenge had not become moot despite the expiration of hissentence and despite the fact that "his civil rights, includingsuffrage and the right to hold public office, [had been] restored," id., at 391, n. 4. Since he had not been pardoned,we said, "some collateral consequences of his conviction remain, including the possibility that the conviction would beused to impeach testimony he might give in a future proceeding and the possibility that it would be used to subject himto persistent felony offender prosecution if he should go totrial on any other felony charges in the future." Ibid. Seealso Benton v. Maryland, 395 U. S. 784, 790-791 (1969);Pennsylvania v. Mimms, 434 U. S. 106, 108, n. 3 (1977) (percuriam); Minnesota v. Dickerson, 508 U. S. 366 (1993).There are several relevant observations to be made re-garding these developments: First, it must be acknowledgedthat the practice of presuming collateral consequences (or ofaccepting the remote possibility of collateral consequences asadequate to satisfy Article III) sits uncomfortably beside the"long-settled principle that standing cannot be `inferred argumentatively from averments in the pleadings,' but rather3 Sibron also purported to rely on United States v. Morgan, 346 U. S.502 (1954), and Fiswick v. United States, 329 U. S. 211 (1946), as establishing that a "mere possibility" of collateral consequences suffices, see 392U. S., at 54-55, but as we have described, those cases involved much morethan that.523US1 Unit: $U30 [05-01-00 12:15:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN11Cite as: 523 U. S. 1 (1998)Opinion of the Court`must affirmatively appear in the record,' " and that "it is theburden of the `party who seeks the exercise of jurisdiction in his favor,' `clearly to allege facts demonstrating thathe is a proper party to invoke judicial resolution of the dispute.' " FW/PBS, Inc. v. Dallas, 493 U. S. 215, 231 (1990)(citations omitted). The practice of presuming collateral con-sequences developed during an era in which it was thoughtthat the only function of the constitutional requirement ofstanding was "to assure that concrete adverseness whichsharpens the presentation of issues," Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S.186, 204 (1962).Sibron appears in the same volume of theUnited States Reports as Flast v. Cohen, 392 U. S. 83 (1968),which said:"The question whether a particular person is a properparty to maintain the action does not, by its own force,raise separation of powers problems related to improperjudicial interference in areas committed to otherbranches of the Federal Government. Such problemsarise, if at all, only from the substantive issues the individual seeks to have adjudicated. Thus, in terms ofArticle III limitations on federal court jurisdiction,the question of standing is related only to whether thedispute sought to be adjudicated will be presented inan adversary context and in a form historically viewedas capable of judicial resolution." Id., at 100-101.See Benton v. Maryland, supra, at 790-791 ("Although thispossibility [of collateral consequences] may well be a remoteone, it is enough to give this case an adversary cast and makeit justiciable"). That parsimonious view of the function ofArticle III standing has since yielded to the acknowledgment that the constitutional requirement is a "means of`defin[ing] the role assigned to the judiciary in a tripartiteallocation of power,' " Valley Forge Christian College v.Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc.,523US1 Unit: $U30 [05-01-00 12:15:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN12 SPENCER v. KEMNAOpinion of the Court454 U. S. 464, 474 (1982),4 and "a part of the basic charter . . .provid[ing] for the interaction between [the federal] government and the governments of the several States," id., at 476.See also Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555,559-560 (1992). And finally, of particular relevance to thequestion whether the practice of presuming collateralconsequences should be extended to challenges of paroletermination: In the context of criminal conviction, the presumption of significant collateral consequences is likely tocomport with reality. As we said inSibron, it is an "obviousfact of life that most criminal convictions do in fact entailadverse collateral legal consequences." 392 U. S., at 55.The same cannot be said of parole revocation.For these reasons, perhaps, we have hitherto refused toextend our presumption of collateral consequences (or ourwillingness to accept hypothetical consequences) to the areaof parole revocation. InLane v. Williams, 455 U. S. 624(1982), we rejected the contention of convicted felons whohad completed their sentences that their challenges to theirsentences of three years' mandatory parole at the conclusionof their fixed terms of incarceration (which parole they hadviolated) were not moot because the revocations of parolecould be used to their detriment in future parole proceedingsshould they ever be convicted of other crimes. We said:"The doctrine of Carafas and Sibron is not applicable inthis case. No civil disabilities such as those present inCarafas result from a finding that an individual has vio-lated his parole."Id., at 632."[Carafas] concerned existing civil disabilities; as aresult of the petitioner's conviction, he was presently4 The internal quotation is from a portion of Flast v. Cohen, 392 U. S. 83,95 (1968), which recited this to be the second purpose of the case-orcontroversy requirement in general. The opinion later said that the constitutionally required minimum of standing relates to the first purposealone. Id., at 100-101, quoted in text.523US1 Unit: $U30 [05-01-00 12:15:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN13Cite as: 523 U. S. 1 (1998)Opinion of the Courtbarred from holding certain offices, voting in state elec-tions, and serving as a juror. This case involves no suchdisability." Id., at 632-633, n. 13.It was not enough that the parole violations found by therevocation decision would enable the parole board to denyrespondents parole in the future, see id., at 639-640 (Mar-shall, J., dissenting) (quoting Illinois rules governing denialof parole). For such violations "[did] not render an individ-ual ineligible for parole under Illinois law[,] [but were] simply one factor, among many, that may be considered by theparole authority . . . ." Id., at 633, n. 13. And, in any event,"[t]he parole violations that remain a part of respondents'records cannot affect a subsequent parole determination unless respondents again violate state law, are returned toprison, and become eligible for parole. Respondents themselves are able--and indeed required by law--to preventsuch a possibility from occurring."Ibid. In addition, werejected as collateral consequences sufficient to keep the controversy alive the possibility that the parole revocationswould affect the individuals' "employment prospects, orthe sentence imposed [upon them] in a future criminal pro-ceeding." Id., at 632. These "nonstatutory consequences"were dependent upon "[t]he discretionary decisions . . . madeby an employer or a sentencing judge," which are "not governed by the mere presence or absence of a recorded viola-tion of parole," but can "take into consideration, and aremore directly influenced by, the underlying conduct thatformed the basis for the parole violation."Id., at 632-633.55 The Court pointed out in Lane that respondents were attacking onlytheir parole sentences, and not their convictions, see 455 U. S., at 631.That was evidently for the purpose of excluding direct application of Sibron. The Court also pointed out, near the conclusion of its opinion, thatrespondents were not attacking "the finding that they violated the termsof their parole." 455 U. S., at 633. This is not framed as an independentground for the decision, and if it were such most of the opinion would have523US1 Unit: $U30 [05-01-00 12:15:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN14 SPENCER v. KEMNAOpinion of the CourtWe adhere to the principles announced in Lane, and de-cline to presume that collateral consequences adequate tomeet Article III's injury-in-fact requirement resulted frompetitioner's parole revocation. The question remains, then,whether petitioner demonstrated such consequences.IIIPetitioner asserts four concrete injuries-in-fact attribut-able to his parole revocation. First, he claims that therevocation could be used to his detriment in a future paroleproceeding. This possibility is no longer contingent onpetitioner's again violating the law; he has already done so,and is currently serving a 7-year term of imprisonment.But it is, nonetheless, still a possibility rather than a cer-tainty or even a probability. Under Missouri law, as underthe Illinois law addressed in Lane, a prior parole revocation"[does] not render an individual ineligible for parole[,] [butis] simply one factor, among many, that may be consideredby the parole authority in determining whether there is asubstantial risk that the parole candidate will not conformto reasonable conditions of parole." 455 U. S., at 633, n. 13.Under Missouri law, "[w]hen in its opinion there is reasonableprobability that an offender . . . can be released without detriment to the community or himself, the board may in itsdiscretion release or parole such person." Mo. Rev. Stat.$ 217.690 (1996). The Missouri Supreme Court has said thatthis statute "giv[es] the Board `almost unlimited discretion'in whether to grant parole release." Shaw v. MissouriBoard of Probation and Parole, 937 S. W. 2d 771, 772 (1997).been unnecessary. The Court did not contest the dissenters' contentionthat "respondents . . . seek to have the parole term declared void, or expunged," id., at 635 (Marshall, J., dissenting), which "would have the effectof removing respondents' parole-violation status and would relieve respondents of the collateral consequences flowing from this status," id., at636, n. 1.523US1 Unit: $U30 [05-01-00 12:15:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN15Cite as: 523 U. S. 1 (1998)Opinion of the CourtPetitioner's second contention is that the Order of Revoca-tion could be used to increase his sentence in a future sentencing proceeding. A similar claim was likewise consid-ered and rejected in Lane, because it was contingent uponrespondents' violating the law, getting caught, and being con-victed. "Respondents themselves are able--and indeed required by law--to prevent such a possibility from occurring."Lane, supra, at 633, n. 13. We of course have rejected anal-ogous claims to Article III standing in other contexts."[W]e are . . . unable to conclude that the case-or-controversy requirement is satisfied by general assertions or inferences that in the course of their activitiesrespondents will be prosecuted for violating valid criminal laws. We assume that respondents will conducttheir activities within the law and so avoid prosecutionand conviction." O'Shea v. Littleton, 414 U. S. 488,497 (1974).See also Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U. S. 95, 102-103 (1983).For similar reasons, we reject petitioner's third and fourthcontentions, that the parole revocation (and, specifically, the"finding of a parole violation for forcible rape and armedcriminal action," see Brief for Petitioner 34) could be usedto impeach him should he appear as a witness or litigant ina future criminal or civil proceeding; or could be used againsthim directly, pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 4056 (orMissouri's state-law equivalent, see Durbin v. Cassalo, 321S. W. 2d 23, 26 (Mo. App. 1959)) or Federal Rule of Evidence413,7 should he appear as a defendant in a criminal proceed6 Federal Rule of Evidence 405 provides, in relevant part, that "[i]n casesin which character or a trait of character of a person is an essential element of a charge, claim, or defense, proof may . . . be made of specificinstances of that person's conduct."7 Federal Rule of Evidence 413 provides, in relevant part, that "[i]n acriminal case in which the defendant is accused of an offense of sexualassault, evidence of the defendant's commission of another offense or of523US1 Unit: $U30 [05-01-00 12:15:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN16 SPENCER v. KEMNAOpinion of the Courting. It is purely a matter of speculation whether such anappearance will ever occur. See O'Shea, supra, at 496-497.Moreover, as to the possibility that petitioner (or a witnessappearing on his behalf) would be impeached with the parolerevocation, it is far from certain that a prosecutor or examin-ing counsel would decide to use the parole revocation (a "discretionary decision" similar to those of the sentencing judgeand employer discussed inLane, supra, at 632-633); and, ifso, whether the presiding judge would admit it, particularlyin light of the far more reliable evidence of two past criminalconvictions that would achieve the same purpose of impeachment, see State v. Comstock, 647 S. W. 2d 163, 165 (Mo. App.1983). Indeed, it is not even clear that a Missouri courtcould legally admit the parole revocation to impeach peti-tioner. SeeState v. Newman, 568 S. W. 2d 276, 278-282 (Mo.App. 1978). And as to the possibility that the parole revocation could be used directly against petitioner should he bethe object of a criminal prosecution, it is at least as likelythat the conduct underlying the revocation, rather than therevocation itself (which does not recite the specific conductconstituting the parole violation) would be used.8fenses of sexual assault is admissible, and may be considered for its bearing on any matter to which it is relevant."8 The dissent asserts that "a finding that an individual has committed aserious felony" renders the "interest in vindicating . . . reputation . . .constitutionally [s]ufficient" to avoid mootness. Post, at 23, 24. We haveobviously not regarded it as sufficient in the past--even when the findingwas not that of a parole board, but the much more solemn condemnationof a full-dress criminal conviction. For that would have rendered entirelyunnecessary the inquiry into concrete collateral consequences of convictionin many of our cases, see, e. g., Benton v. Maryland, 395 U. S. 784, 790-791(1969); Carafas v. LaVallee, 391 U. S. 234, 237-238 (1968); Fiswick, 329U. S., at 220-222, and unnecessary as well (at least as to felony convictions)Sibron's presumption of collateral consequences, see supra, at 8-10. Ofcourse there is no reason in principle for limiting the dissent's novel theoryto felonies: If constitutionally adequate damage to reputation is producedby a parole board's finding of one more felony by a current inmate who523US1 Unit: $U30 [05-01-00 12:15:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN17Cite as: 523 U. S. 1 (1998)Opinion of the CourtIVPetitioner raises three more arguments, none of whichseems to us well taken. First, he contends that since ourdecision in Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U. S. 477 (1994), wouldforeclose him from pursuing a damages action under Rev.Stat. $ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, unless he can establish theinvalidity of his parole revocation, his action to establish thatinvalidity cannot be moot. This is a great non sequitur, un-less one believes (as we do not) that a $ 1983 action for damages must always and everywhere be available. It is notcertain, in any event, that a $ 1983 damages claim would beforeclosed. If, for example, petitioner were to seek damages"for using the wrong procedures, not for reaching the wrongresult," see Heck, 512 U. S., at 482-483, and if that proce-dural defect did not "necessarily imply the invalidity of " therevocation, see id., at 487, then Heck would have no applica-tion all. See alsoEdwards v. Balisok, 520 U. S. 641, 645-649(1997); id., at 649-650 (Ginsburg, J., concurring).Secondly, petitioner argues in his reply brief that this casefalls within the exception to the mootness doctrine for casesthat are "capable of repetition, yet evading review." ReplyBrief for Petitioner 5. "[T]he capable-of-repetition doctrineapplies only in exceptional situations," Lyons, supra, at 109,"where the following two circumstances [are] simultaneouslypresent: ` "(1) the challenged action [is] in its duration tooshort to be fully litigated prior to cessation or expiration,and (2) there [is] a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party [will] be subject to the same action again," ' "Lewis, 494 U. S., at 481 (quoting Murphy v. Hunt, 455 U. S.478, 482 (1982) (per curiam), in turn quoting Weinstein v.has spent six of the last seven years in custody on three separate felonyconvictions, surely it is also produced by the criminal misdemeanor conviction of a model citizen. Perhaps for obvious reasons, the damage to reputation upon which the dissent would rest its judgment has not been asserted before us by petitioner himself.523US1 Unit: $U30 [05-01-00 12:15:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN18 SPENCER v. KEMNASouter, J., concurringBradford, 423 U. S. 147, 149 (1975) (per curiam)); see alsoNorman v. Reed, 502 U. S. 279, 288 (1992). Petitioner's casesatisfies neither of these conditions. He has not shown (andwe doubt that he could) that the time between parole revocation and expiration of sentence is always so short as to evadereview. Nor has he demonstrated a reasonable likelihoodthat he will once again be paroled and have that parolerevoked.Finally, petitioner argues that, even if his case is moot,that fact should be ignored because it was caused by thedilatory tactics of the state attorney general's office and thedelay of the District Court. But mootness, however it mayhave come about, simply deprives us of our power to act;there is nothing for us to remedy, even if we were disposedto do so. We are not in the business of pronouncing thatpast actions which have no demonstrable continuing effectwere right or wrong. As for petitioner's concern that lawenforcement officials and district judges will repeat with impunity the mootness-producing abuse that he alleges oc-curred here: We are confident that, as a general matter, district courts will prevent dilatory tactics by the litigants andwill not unduly delay their own rulings; and that, where appropriate, corrective mandamus will issue from the courtsof appeals.* * *For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of theCourt of Appeals.
