2  WATTERS  v.  WACHOVIA  BANK,  N.  A. 

Syllabus 
ent  Wachovia  Mortgage  Corporation,  a  wholly  owned,  North  Carolina-
chartered entity licensed as an operating subsidiary by OCC, and doing 
business  in  Michigan  and  elsewhere.  Michigan  law  exempts  banks, 
both  national  and  state,  from  state  mortgage  lending  regulation,  but 
requires their subsidiaries to register with the State's Office of Financial 
and  Insurance  Services  (OFIS)  and  submit  to  state  supervision.  Al-
though  Wachovia  Mortgage  initially  complied  with  Michigan's  require-
ments, it surrendered its Michigan registration once it became a wholly 
owned  operating  subsidiary  of  Wachovia  Bank.  Subsequently,  peti-
tioner Watters, the OFIS commissioner, advised Wachovia Mortgage it 
would no longer be authorized to engage in mortgage lending in Michi-
gan.  Respondents  sued  for  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief,  contend-
ing  that  the  NBA  and  OCC's  regulations  preempt  application  of  the 
relevant Michigan mortgage lending laws to a national bank's operating 
subsidiary.  Watters  responded  that,  because  Wachovia  Mortgage  was 
not itself a national bank, the challenged Michigan laws were applicable 
and were not preempted.  She also argued that the Tenth Amendment 
to the U. S. Constitution prohibits OCC's exclusive regulation and super-
vision of national banks' lending activities conducted through operating 
subsidiaries.  Rejecting  those  arguments,  the  Federal  District  Court 
granted  the  Wachovia  plaintiffs  summary  judgment  in  relevant  part, 
and the Sixth Circuit affirmed. 

Held: 

1.  Wachovia's mortgage business, whether conducted by the bank it-
self or through the bank's  operating subsidiary, is subject  to OCC's su-
perintendence, and not to the licensing, reporting, and visitorial regimes 
of the several States in which the subsidiary operates.  Pp. 10-21. 

(a)  The NBA vests in nationally chartered banks enumerated pow-
ers and all "necessary" incidental powers.  12 U. S. C. $ 24 Seventh.  To 
prevent  inconsistent  or  intrusive  state  regulation,  the  NBA  provides 
that "[n]o national bank shall be subject to any visitorial powers except 
as  authorized  by  Federal  law  .  .  .  ."  $ 484(a).  Federally  chartered 
banks are subject to state laws of general application in their daily busi-
ness to the extent such laws do not conflict with the letter or purposes 
of the NBA.  But when state prescriptions significantly impair the ex-
ercise of authority, enumerated or incidental under the NBA, the State's 
regulations must give way.  E. g., Barnett Bank of Marion Cty., N. A. 
v.  Nelson,  517 U. S. 25, 32-34.  The NBA expressly authorizes national 
banks  to  engage  in  mortgage  lending,  subject  to  OCC  regulation, 

$ 371(a).  State  law  may  not  significantly  burden  a  bank's  exercise  of 
that  power,  see,  e. g.,  id.,  at  33-34.  In  particular,  real  estate  lending, 
when conducted by a national bank, is immune from state visitorial con-

trol: The NBA specifically vests exclusive authority to examine and in-
spect  in  OCC.  12  U. S. C.  $ 484(a).  The  Michigan  provisions  at  issue 
exempt national banks themselves from coverage.  This is not simply a 
matter  of the  Michigan Legislature's  grace.  For, as  the parties recog-
nize,  the  NBA  would  spare  a  national  bank  from  state  controls  of  the 
kind here involved.  Pp. 10-15. 

(b)  Since  1966,  OCC  has  recognized  national  banks'  "incidental" 
authority  under  $ 24  Seventh  to  do  business  through  operating  sub-
sidiaries.  See  12  CFR  $ 5.34(e)(1).  That  authority  is  uncontested  by 
Michigan's  Commissioner.  OCC  licenses  and  oversees  national  bank 
operating  subsidiaries  just  as  it  does  national  banks.  See,  e. g., 

$ 5.34(e)(3); 12 U. S. C. $ 24a(g)(3)(A).  Just as duplicative state examina-
tion,  supervision,  and  regulation  would  significantly  burden  national 
banks'  mortgage  lending,  so  too  those  state  controls  would  interfere 
with that same activity when engaged in by a national bank's operating 
subsidiary.  This Court has never held that the NBA's preemptive reach 
extends only to a national bank itself; instead, the Court has focused on 
the exercise of a national bank's powers, not on its corporate structure, 
in analyzing whether state law hampers the federally permitted activi-
ties of a national bank.  See, e. g., Barnett Bank, 517 U. S., at 32.  And 
the  Court  has  treated  operating  subsidiaries  as  equivalent  to  national 
banks with respect to powers exercised under federal law (except where 
federal law provides otherwise).  See, e. g., NationsBank, 513 U. S., at 
256-261.  Security  against  significant  interference  by  state  regulators 
is  a  characteristic  condition  of  "the  business  of  banking"  conducted  by 
national  banks,  and  mortgage  lending  is  one  aspect  of  that  business. 
See, e. g., 12 U. S. C. $ 484(a).  That security should adhere whether the 
business is conducted by the bank itself or by an OCC-licensed operating 
subsidiary whose authority to carry on the business coincides completely 
with the bank's. 

Watters  contends  that  if  Congress  meant  to  deny  States  visitorial 
powers over operating subsidiaries, it would have written $ 484(a)'s ban 
on state inspection to apply not only to national banks but also to their 
affiliates.  She points out that $ 481, which authorizes OCC to examine 
"affiliates"  of  national banks,  does  not  speak to  state visitorial  powers. 
This  argument  fails  for  two  reasons.  First,  any  intention  regarding 
operating  subsidiaries  cannot  be  ascribed  to  the  1864  Congress  that 
enacted  $$ 481  and  484,  or  the  1933  Congress  that  added  the  affiliate 
examination  provisions  to  $ 481  and  the  "affiliate"  definition  to  $ 221a, 
because operating subsidiaries were not authorized until 1966.  Second, 
Watters ignores the distinctions Congress recognized among "affiliates." 
Unlike  affiliates  that  may  engage  in  functions  not  authorized  by  the 
NBA,  an  operating  subsidiary  is  tightly  tied  to  its  parent  by  the

Syllabus 
specification  that  it  may  engage  only  in  "the  business  of  banking," 

$ 24a(g)(3)(A).  Notably,  when  Congress  amended  the  NBA  to  provide 
that  operating  subsidiaries  may  "engag[e]  solely  in  activities  that  na-
tional  banks  are  permitted  to  engage  in  directly,"  ibid.,  it did  so  in  an 
Act providing that other  affiliates, authorized to engage in nonbanking 
financial  activities,  e. g.,  securities  and  insurance,  are  subject  to  state 
regulation  in  connection  with  those  activities,  see,  e. g.,  $$ 1843(k), 
1844(c)(4).  Pp. 15-20. 

(c)  Recognizing  the  necessary  consequence  of  national  banks'  au-
thority to engage in mortgage lending through an operating subsidiary 
"subject  to  the  same  terms  and  conditions  that  govern  the  conduct  of 
such  activities  by  national  banks,"  $ 24a(g)(3)(A),  OCC  promulgated  12 
CFR $ 7.4006: "Unless otherwise provided by Federal law or OCC regu-
lation,  State  laws  apply  to  national  bank  operating  subsidiaries  to  the 
same extent that those laws apply to the parent national bank."  Wat-
ters  disputes  OCC's  authority  to  promulgate  this  regulation  and  con-
tends that, because preemption is a legal question for determination by 
courts,  $ 7.4006  should  attract  no  deference.  This  argument  is  beside 
the  point,  for  $ 7.4006  merely  clarifies  and  confirms  what  the  NBA  al-
ready  conveys:  A  national  bank  may  engage  in  real  estate  lending 
through  an  operating  subsidiary,  subject  to  the  same  terms  and  condi-
tions  that  govern  the  bank  itself;  that  power  cannot  be  significantly 

impaired  or  impeded  by  state  law.  Though  state  law  governs 
incorporation-related  issues, state  regulators  cannot  interfere  with  the 
"business  of  banking"  by  subjecting  national  banks  or  their  OCC-
licensed operating subsidiaries to multiple audits and surveillance under 
rival oversight regimes.  Pp. 20-21. 

2.  Watters'  alternative  argument,  that  12  CFR  $ 7.4006  violates  the 
Tenth Amendment, is unavailing.  The Amendment expressly disclaims 
any  reservation  to  the  States  of  a  power  delegated  to  Congress  in  the 
Constitution,  New  York  v.  United  States,  505  U. S.  144,  156.  Because 
regulation  of  national  bank  operations  is  Congress'  prerogative  under 
the  Commerce  and  Necessary  and  Proper  Clauses,  see  Citizens  Bank 
v.  Alafabco,  Inc.,  539  U. S.  52,  58,  the  Amendment  is  not  implicated 
here.  P. 22. 

431 F. 3d 556, affirmed.

largely to the exclusion of other governmental entities, state or federal.  See $ 484(a); 12 CFR $ 7.4000 (2006). 

The NBA specifically authorizes federally chartered banks to  engage  in  real  estate  lending.  12  U. S. C.  $ 371.  It  also 
provides  that  banks  shall  have  power  "[t]o  exercise  .  .  .  all such incidental powers  as shall be necessary to carry on the 
business of banking."  $ 24 Seventh.  Among incidental powers, national banks may conduct certain activities 
through  "operating  subsidiaries,"  discrete  entities  author-ized to engage solely in activities the bank itself could under-
take,  and  subject to  the  same terms  and conditions  as those applicable  to  the  bank.  See  $ 24a(g)(3)(A);  12  CFR  $ 5.34(e) 
(2006). Respondent  Wachovia  Bank,  a  national  bank,  conducts  its 
real  estate  lending  business  through  Wachovia  Mortgage Corporation, a wholly owned, state-chartered entity, licensed 
as an operating subsidiary by OCC.  It is uncontested in this suit that Wachovia's real estate business, if conducted by the 
national bank itself, would be subject to OCC's superintend-ence, to the exclusion of state registration requirements and 
visitorial authority.  The question in  dispute is whether the bank's mortgage lending activities remain outside the gover-
nance  of  state  licensing  and  auditing  agencies  when  those activities  are  conducted,  not  by  a  division  or  department  of 
the bank, but by the bank's operating subsidiary.  In accord with  the  Courts  of  Appeals  that  have  addressed  the  issue,

1 

we  hold  that  Wachovia's  mortgage  business,  whether  con-ducted  by  the  bank  itself  or  through  the  bank's  operating 

subsidiary,  is  subject  to  OCC's  superintendence,  and  not  to the licensing, reporting, and visitorial regimes of the several 
States in which the subsidiary operates.

Opinion of the Court 

I 
Wachovia Bank is a national banking association chartered by OCC.  Respondent  Wachovia Mortgage is a  North Caro-

lina  corporation  that  engages  in  the  business  of  real  estate lending in the State of Michigan and elsewhere.  Michigan's 
statutory  regime  exempts  banks,  both  national  and  state, from  state  mortgage  lending  regulation,  but  requires  mort-
gage  brokers,  lenders,  and  servicers  that  are  subsidiaries  of national banks to register with the State's Office of Financial 
and Insurance  Services (OFIS)  and  submit  to  state  supervi-sion.  Mich.  Comp.  Laws  Ann.  $$ 445.1656(1),  445.1679(1)(a) 
(West  2002),  493.52(1),  and  493.53a(d)  (West  1998).2  From 1997  until  2003,  Wachovia  Mortgage  was  registered  with 
OFIS to engage in mortgage lending.  As  a registrant,  Wa-chovia  Mortgage  was  required,  inter  alia,  to  pay  an  annual 
operating  fee,  file  an  annual  report,  and  open  its  books  and records  to  inspection  by  OFIS  examiners.  $$ 445.1657,

Opinion of the Court 
months later, Wachovia Mortgage advised the State of Michi-
gan  that  it  was  surrendering  its  mortgage  lending  registra-
tion.  Because  it  had  become  an  operating  subsidiary  of  a 
national  bank,  Wachovia  Mortgage  maintained,  Michigan's 
registration  and  inspection  requirements  were  preempted. 
Watters  responded  with  a  letter  advising  Wachovia  Mort-
gage that it would no longer be authorized to conduct mort-
gage lending activities in Michigan. 

Wachovia  Mortgage  and  Wachovia  Bank  filed  suit  against 
Watters,  in  her  official  capacity  as  commissioner,  in  the 
United  States  District  Court  for  the  Western  District  of 
Michigan.  They  sought  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief 
prohibiting  Watters  from  enforcing  Michigan's  registration 
prescriptions against Wachovia Mortgage, and from interfer-
ing with OCC's exclusive visitorial authority.  The NBA and 
regulations promulgated thereunder, they urged, vest super-
visory  authority  in  OCC  and  preempt  the  application  of  the 
state-law controls at issue.  Specifically, Wachovia Mortgage 
and  Wachovia  Bank  challenged  as  preempted  certain  pro-
visions  of  two  Michigan  statutes--the  Mortgage  Brokers, 
Lenders,  and  Services  Licensing  Act  and  the  Secondary 
Mortgage  Loan  Act.  The  challenged  provisions  (1)  require 
mortgage  lenders--including  national  bank  operating  sub-
sidiaries  but  not  national  banks  themselves--to  register 
and  pay  fees  to  the  State  before  they  may  conduct  banking 
activities  in  Michigan,  and  authorize  the  commissioner  to 
deny  or  revoke  registrations,  $$ 445.1652(1)  (West  Supp.

(West  2002),  445.1671,  493.56a(2)  (West  1998);  (3)  grant  the

(West 2002), 445.1666, 493.58-59, and 493.62a (West 1998). 

In response, Watters argued that, because Wachovia Mort-
gage was not itself a national bank, the challenged Michigan 
controls were applicable and were not preempted.  She also 
contended that the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution of 
the United States prohibits OCC's exclusive superintendence 
of national bank lending activities conducted through operat-
ing subsidiaries. 

The  District  Court  granted  summary  judgment  to  the 
banks in relevant part.  334 F. Supp. 2d 957, 966 (WD Mich. 
2004).  Invoking  the  two-step  framework  of  Chevron 
U. S. A. Inc. v.  Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 
U. S.  837  (1984),  the  court  deferred  to  the  Comptroller's  de-
termination  that  an  operating  subsidiary  is  subject  to  state 
regulation only to the extent that the parent bank would be 
if it performed the same functions.  334 F. Supp. 2d, at 963- 
965  (citing,  e. g.,  12  CFR  $$ 5.34(e)(3),  7.4006  (2004)).  The 
court  also  rejected  Watters'  Tenth  Amendment  argument. 
334  F.  Supp.  2d,  at  965-966.  The  Sixth  Circuit  affirmed.

A 

Nearly 200 years ago, in McCulloch v.  Maryland, 4 Wheat. 
316  (1819),  this  Court  held  federal  law  supreme  over  state 
law  with  respect  to  national  banking.  Though  the  bank  at 
issue  in  McCulloch  was  short-lived,  a  federal  banking  sys-
tem reemerged in the Civil War era.  See Atherton v.  FDIC, 
519  U. S.  213,  221-222  (1997);  B.  Hammond,  Banks  and  Poli-
tics in America: from the Revolution to the Civil War (1957). 
In 1864, Congress enacted the NBA, establishing the system 
of national banking still in  place today.  National Bank Act,

439 U. S. 299, 310, 314-315 (1978).  The Act vested in nation-ally  chartered  banks  enumerated  powers  and  "all  such  inci-
dental powers as shall be necessary to carry on the business of  banking."  12  U. S. C.  $ 24  Seventh.  To  prevent  incon-
sistent  or  intrusive  state  regulation  from  impairing  the  na-tional  system,  Congress  provided:  "No  national  bank  shall 
be  subject  to  any  visitorial  powers  except  as  authorized  by Federal law . . . ."   $  484(a). 

In  the  years  since  the  NBA's  enactment,  we  have  repeat-edly made clear that federal control shields national banking 
from  unduly  burdensome  and  duplicative  state  regulation. See, 

e. g.,  Beneficial  Nat.  Bank  v.  Anderson,  539  U. S.  1,  10 (2003) (national banking system protected from "possible un-

friendly State legislation" (quoting Tiffany v.  National Bank of Mo., 18 Wall. 409, 412 (1874))).  Federally chartered banks 
are subject to state laws of general application in their daily business to the extent such laws do not conflict with the let-
ter  or  the  general  purposes  of  the  NBA.  Davis  v.  Elmira 
Savings Bank, 161 U. S. 275, 290 (1896).  See also Atherton, 519 U. S., at 223.  For example, state usury laws govern the 

maximum rate of interest national banks can charge on loans, 12  U. S. C.  $ 85,  contracts  made  by  national  banks  "are  gov-
erned and construed by State laws," National Bank v.  Com-monwealth,  9  Wall.  353,  362  (1870),  and  national  banks'  "ac-
quisition and transfer  of property  [are] based  on State law," ibid.  However, "the States can exercise no control over [na-
tional  banks],  nor  in  any  wise  affect  their  operation,  except in so far as Congress may see proper to permit.  Any thing 
beyond this is an abuse, because it is the usurpation of power which  a  single  State  cannot  give."

ics'  Nat.  Bank  v.  Dearing,  91  U. S.  29,  34  (1875)  (internal quotation marks omitted). 

We have "interpret[ed] grants of both enumerated and in-cidental `powers' to national banks as grants of authority not 
normally  limited by,  but rather  ordinarily pre-empting,  con-trary  state  law."  Barnett  Bank  of  Marion  Cty.,  N.  A.  v. 
Nelson,  517  U. S.  25,  32  (1996).  See  also  Franklin  Nat. 
Bank  of  Franklin  Square  v.  New  York,  347  U. S.  373,  375- 379  (1954).  States  are  permitted  to  regulate  the  activities 

of  national  banks  where  doing  so  does  not  prevent  or  sig-nificantly  interfere  with  the  national  bank's  or  the  national 
bank  regulator's  exercise  of  its  powers.  But  when  state prescriptions  significantly  impair  the  exercise  of  authority, 
enumerated  or  incidental  under  the  NBA,  the  State's  regu-lations  must  give  way.  Barnett  Bank,  517  U. S.,  at  32-34 
(federal  law  permitting  national  banks  to  sell  insurance  in small towns preempted state statute prohibiting banks from 
selling  most  types  of  insurance);  Franklin  Nat.  Bank,  347 U. S.,  at  377-379  (local  restrictions  preempted  because  they 
burdened  exercise  of  national  banks'  incidental  power  to advertise). 

The NBA authorizes national banks to engage in mortgage lending, subject to OCC regulation.  The Act provides: 

"Any national banking association may make, arrange, purchase or sell loans or extensions of credit secured by 
liens  on  interests  in  real  estate,  subject  to  1828(o) of  this  title  and  such  restrictions  and  requirements  as  the 
Comptroller  of  the  Currency  may  prescribe  by  regula-tion or order."  12 U. S. C. $ 371(a).

4 Title  12  U. S. C.  $1828(o)  requires  federal  banking  agencies  to  adopt 
uniform  regulations  prescribing  standards  for  real  estate  lending  by  de-
pository  institutions  and  sets  forth  criteria  governing  such  standards. 
See, e. g., $ 1828(o)(2)(A) ("In prescribing standards . . . the agencies shall 
consider--(i) the risk posed to the deposit insurance funds by such exten-
sions of credit; (ii) the need for safe and sound operation of insured deposi-
tory institutions; and (iii) the availability of credit.").

Opinion of the Court 
Beyond  genuine  dispute,  state  law  may  not  significantly burden a national bank's own exercise of its real estate lend-

ing  power,  just  as  it  may  not  curtail  or  hinder  a  national bank's  efficient  exercise  of  any  other  power,  incidental  or 
enumerated  under  the  NBA.  See  Barnett  Bank,  517  U. S., at 33-34; Franklin, 347 U. S., at 375-379.  See also 12 CFR 

$ 34.4(a)(1)  (2006)  (identifying  preempted  state  controls  on mortgage  lending,  including  licensing  and  registration).  In 
particular, real estate lending, when conducted by a national bank, is immune from state visitorial control: The NBA spe-
cifically  vests  exclusive  authority  to  examine  and  inspect  in 
OCC.  12 U. S. C. $ 484(a) ("No national bank shall be subject to  any  visitorial  powers  except  as  authorized  by  Federal 

law.").5 Harmoniously,  the  Michigan  provisions  at  issue  exempt 
national  banks  from  coverage.  Mich.  Comp.  Laws  Ann. $ 445.1675(a) (West 2002).  This is not simply a matter of the 
Michigan  Legislature's  grace.  Cf.  post,  at  34,  and  n.  17. 
For, as the  parties recognize,  the  NBA  would have  preemp-tive  force, 

i. e.,  it  would  spare  a  national  bank  from  state 
controls of the  kind here  involved.  See Brief for Petitioner 12; Brief for Respondents 14; Brief for United States as

cus  Curiae  9.  State  laws  that  conditioned  national  banks' real  estate  lending  on  registration  with  the  State,  and  sub-

jected  such  lending  to  the  State's  investigative  and  enforce-ment machinery  would surely  interfere  with  the  banks' fed-
erally authorized business: National  banks would be subject to  registration,  inspection,  and  enforcement  regimes  im-
posed  not  just  by  Michigan,  but  by  all  States  in  which  the banks operate.

Opinion of the Court 
national  banks'  engagement  in  the  business  of  banking,  we 
observed over a century ago, is precisely what the NBA was 
designed to prevent:  "Th[e] legislation  has  in  view the  erec-
tion of a system extending throughout the country, and inde-
pendent,  so  far  as  powers  conferred  are  concerned,  of  state 
legislation which, if permitted to be applicable, might impose 
limitations  and  restrictions  as  various  and  as  numerous  as 
the  States."  Easton  v.  Iowa,  188  U. S.  220,  229  (1903). 
Congress  did  not  intend,  we  explained,  "to  leave  the  field 
open  for  the  States  to  attempt  to  promote  the  welfare  and 
stability  of  national  banks  by  direct  legislation. . . .  [C]on-
fusion  would  necessarily  result  from  control  possessed  and 
exercised by two independent authorities."  Id., at 231-232. 

Recognizing the burdens and undue duplication state con-
trols  could  produce,  Congress  included  in  the  NBA  an  ex-
press  command:  "No  national  bank  shall  be  subject  to  any 
visitorial powers except as authorized by  Federal law . . . ." 
12  U. S. C.  $ 484(a).  See supra,  at  11-12,  13;  post,  at  31  (ac-
knowledging  that  national  banks  have  been  "exemp[t]  from 
state  visitorial  authority . . . for  more  than  140  years"). 
"Visitation,"  we  have  explained  "is  the  act  of  a  superior  or 
superintending  officer,  who  visits  a  corporation  to  examine 
into  its  manner  of  conducting  business,  and  enforce  an  ob-
servance of its laws and regulations."  Guthrie v.  Harkness, 
199  U. S. 148, 158 (1905)  (internal quotation marks  omitted). 
See  also  12  CFR  $ 7.4000(a)(2)  (2006)  (defining  "visitorial" 
power  as  "(i)  [e]xamination  of  a  bank;  (ii)  [i]nspection  of  a 
bank's books and records; (iii) [r]egulation and supervision of 
activities  authorized  or  permitted  pursuant  to  federal  bank-
ing  law;  and  (iv)  [e]nforcing  compliance  with  any  applicable 
federal  or  state  laws  concerning  those  activities").  Michi-
gan,  therefore,  cannot  confer  on  its  commissioner  examina-

B 
While  conceding  that  Michigan's  licensing,  registration, and  inspection  requirements  cannot  be  applied  to  national 

banks,  see,  e. g.,  Brief  for  Petitioner  10,  12,  Watters  argues that the State's regulatory regime survives preemption with 
respect  to  national  banks'  operating  subsidiaries.  Because such  subsidiaries  are  separately  chartered  under  some 
State's law, Watters characterizes them simply as "affiliates" of  national  banks,  and  contends  that  even  though  they  are 
subject  to  OCC's  superintendence,  they  are  also  subject  to multistate control. 

Id., at 17-22.  We disagree. Since 1966, OCC has recognized the "incidental" authority 

of national banks under $ 24 Seventh to do business through 

7 Ours is indeed a "dual banking system."  See post, at 22-26, 43.  But 
it  is  a  system  that  has  never  permitted  States  to  license,  inspect,  and 
supervise national banks as they do state banks.  The dissent repeatedly 
refers to the policy of "competitive equality" featured in First Nat. Bank 
in Plant City v.  Dickinson, 396 U. S. 122, 131 (1969).  See post, at 25, 35, 
40,  43.  Those  words,  however,  should  not  be  ripped  from  their  context. 
Plant City involved the McFadden Act (Branch Banks), 44  Stat. 1228, 12 
U. S. C.  $ 36,  in  which  Congress  expressly  authorized  national  banks  to 
establish branches "only when, where, and how state law would authorize 
a state bank to establish and operate such [branches]."  396 U. S., at 130. 
See also id., at 131 ("[W]hile Congress has absolute authority over national 
banks,  the  [McFadden  Act]  has  incorporated  by  reference  the  limitations 
which state law places on branch banking activities by state banks.  Con-
gress has deliberately settled upon a policy intended to foster competitive 
equality. . . . [The] Act reflects the congressional concern that neither sys-
tem ha[s] advantages over the other in the use of branch banking." (quot-
ing First Nat. Bank of Logan v.  Walker Bank & Trust Co., 385 U. S. 252, 
261 (1966))).  "[W]here Congress has not expressly conditioned the grant 
of `power' upon a grant of state permission, the Court has ordinarily found 
that  no  such  condition  applies."  Barnett  Bank  of  Marion  Cty.,  N.  A.  v. 
Nelson, 517 U. S. 25, 34 (1996).  The NBA provisions before us, unlike the 
McFadden  Act,  do  not  condition  the  exercise  of  power  by  national  banks 
on state allowance of similar exercises by state banks.  See supra, at 13.

bank,  except  where  otherwise  provided  by  law  or  OCC 
regulation."). 

In  1999,  Congress  defined  and  regulated  "financial"  sub-
sidiaries;  simultaneously,  Congress  distinguished  those  na-
tional  bank  affiliates  from  subsidiaries--typed  "operating 
subsidiaries"  by  OCC--which  may  engage  only  in  activi-

$ 24a(g)(3)(A)).9  For  supervisory  purposes,  OCC  treats  na-tional banks and their operating subsidiaries as a single eco-

nomic enterprise.  Comptroller's Handbook 64.  OCC  over-sees  both  entities  by  reference  to  "business  line,"  applying 
the same controls whether banking "activities are conducted directly or through an operating subsidiary."  Ibid.

As earlier noted, Watters does not contest the authority of national banks to do business through operating subsidiaries. 

Nor does she dispute OCC's authority to supervise and regu-late  operating  subsidiaries  in  the  same  manner  as  national 
banks.  Still,  Watters  seeks  to  impose  state  regulation  on operating subsidiaries over and above regulation undertaken 
by OCC.  But just as duplicative state examination, supervi-sion,  and  regulation  would  significantly  burden  mortgage 
lending  when  engaged  in  by  national  banks,  see  supra,  at 

9 OCC  subsequently  revised  its  regulations  to  track  the  statute.  See 

$ 5.34(e)(1), (3); Financial Subsidiaries and Operating Subsidiaries, 65 Fed. 
Reg. 12905, 12911 (2000).  Cf. post, at 29, 30 (dissent's grudging acknowl-
edgment that Congress "may have acquiesced" in OCC's position that na-
tional banks  may  engage in  "the business  of  banking" through  operating 
subsidiaries empowered to do only what the bank itself can do). 

10 For example, "for purposes of applying statutory or regulatory limits, 

such  as lending limits  or dividend  restrictions," e. g., 12  U. S. C. $$ 56,  60, 
84, 371d, "[t]he results of operations of operating subsidiaries are consoli-
dated with those  of its  parent."  Comptroller's Handbook 64.  Likewise, 
for accounting and regulatory reporting purposes, an operating subsidiary 
is  treated  as  part  of  the  member  bank;  assets  and  liabilities  of  the  two 
entities are combined.  See 12 CFR $$ 5.34(e)(4)(i), 223.3(w) (2006).  OCC 
treats financial subsidiaries differently.  A national bank may not consoli-
date  the  assets  and  liabilities  of  a  financial  subsidiary  with  those  of  the 
bank.  Comptroller's Handbook 64.  It cannot be fairly maintained "that 
the transfer in 2003 of [Wachovia Mortgage's] ownership from the holding 
company  to  the  Bank"  resulted  in  no  relevant  changes  to  the  company's 
business.  Compare  post,  at  35,  with  supra,  at  16,  n.  8.  On  becoming 
Wachovia's  operating  subsidiary,  Wachovia  Mortgage  became  subject  to 
the same terms and conditions as national banks, including the full super-
visory  authority  of  OCC.  This  change  exposed  the  company  to  signifi-
cantly  more  federal  oversight  than  it  experienced  as  a  state  nondeposi-
tory institution.

Opinion of the Court 
11-15,  so  too  would  those  state  controls  interfere  with  that same  activity  when  engaged  in  by  an  operating  subsidiary. 

We have never held that the preemptive reach of the NBA extends  only to a national bank itself.  Rather, in  analyzing 
whether state law hampers the federally permitted activities of  a  national  bank,  we  have  focused  on  the  exercise  of  a  na-
tional  bank's  powers,  not  on  its  corporate  structure.  See, 
e. g.,  Barnett  Bank,  517  U. S.,  at  32.  And  we  have  treated operating  subsidiaries  as  equivalent  to  national  banks  with 

respect to powers exercised under federal law (except where federal  law  provides  otherwise).  In  NationsBank  of  N.  C., 
N.  A.,  513  U. S.,  at  256-261,  for  example,  we  upheld  OCC's determination that national banks had "incidental" authority 
to act as agents in the sale of annuities.  It was not material that the function qualifying as within "the business of bank-
ing,"  $ 24  Seventh,  was  to  be  carried  out  not  by  the  bank itself, but by an operating subsidiary, i. e., an entity "subject 
to the same terms and conditions that govern the conduct of [the activity] by  national banks [themselves]," $ 24a(g)(3)(A); 
12 CFR $ 5.34(e)(3) (2006).  See also Clarke v.  Securities In-
dustry  Assn.,  479  U. S.  388  (1987)  (national  banks,  acting through operating subsidiaries, have power to offer discount 

brokerage services).11 Security  against  significant  interference  by  state  regula-
tors is a characteristic condition of the "business of banking" conducted  by  national  banks,  and  mortgage  lending  is  one 
aspect  of  that  business.  See,  e. g.,  12  U. S C.  $ 484(a);  12 CFR $ 34.4(a)(1) (2006).  See also supra, at 11-15; post, at 27

subject  to the  same  federal oversight  as  their  national  bank

laws in borrower's State, but declining to consider operating subsidiaries).

Opinion of the Court 
parents").  That  security  should  adhere  whether  the  busi-ness is conducted by the bank itself or is assigned to an oper-

ating  subsidiary  licensed  by  OCC  whose  authority  to  carry on  the  business  coincides  completely  with  that  of  the  bank. 
See  Wells  Fargo  Bank,  N.  A.  v.  Boutris,  419  F.  3d  949,  960 (CA9  2005)  (determination  whether  to  conduct  business 
through  operating  subsidiaries  or  through  subdivisions  is 
"essentially one of internal organization"). Watters  contends  that  if  Congress  meant  to  deny  States 

visitorial  powers  over  operating  subsidiaries,  it  would  have written $ 484(a)'s ban on state inspection to apply not only to 
national  banks  but  also  to  their  affiliates.  She  points  out 
that  $ 481,  which  authorizes  OCC  to  examine  "affiliates"  of 
national  banks,  does  not  speak  to  state  visitorial  powers. 
This  argument  fails  for  two  reasons.  First,  one  cannot  as-
cribe  any  intention  regarding  operating  subsidiaries  to  the 
1864 Congress that enacted $$ 481 and 484, or the 1933 Con-
gress  that  added  the  provisions  on  examining  affiliates  to 

$ 481  and  the  definition  of  "affiliate"  to  $ 221a.  That  is  so 
because  operating  subsidiaries  were  not  authorized  until 
1966.  See  supra,  at  15-16.  Over  the  past  four  decades, 
during  which  operating  subsidiaries  have  emerged  as  im-
portant  instrumentalities  of  national  banks,  Congress  and 
OCC have indicated no doubt that such subsidiaries are "sub-
ject  to  the  same  terms  and  conditions"  as  national  banks 
themselves. 

Second,  Watters  ignores  the  distinctions  Congress  recog-
nized among "affiliates."  The NBA broadly defines the term 
"affiliate"  to  include  "any  corporation"  controlled  by  a  na-
tional bank, including a subsidiary.  See 12 U. S. C. $ 221a(b). 
An  operating  subsidiary  is  therefore  one  type  of  "affiliate." 
But unlike affiliates that may engage in functions not author-
ized  by  the  NBA,  e. g.,  financial  subsidiaries,  an  operating 
subsidiary  is  tightly  tied  to  its  parent  by  the  specification 
that  it  may  engage  only  in  "the  business  of  banking"  as  au-
thorized  by  the  Act.  $ 24a(g)(3)(A);  12  CFR  $ 5.34(e)(1)

Opinion of the Court 
(2006).  See also supra, at 16-17, and n. 10.  Notably, when 
Congress  amended  the  NBA  confirming  that  operating  sub-
sidiaries  may  "engag[e]  solely  in  activities  that  national 
banks  are  permitted  to  engage  in  directly,"  12  U. S. C. 

$ 24a(g)(3)(A),  it  did  so  in  an  Act,  the  GLBA,  providing  that 
other affiliates, authorized to engage in nonbanking financial 
activities,  e. g.,  securities and  insurance, are  subject to state 
regulation  in  connection  with  those  activities.  See,  e. g., 

$$ 1843(k), 1844(c)(4).  See also 15 U. S. C. $ 6701(b) (any per-
son  who  sells  insurance  must  obtain  a  state  license  to  do 
so).12 

C 

Recognizing  the  necessary consequence  of national banks' 
authority to engage in mortgage lending  through an operat-
ing subsidiary "subject to the same terms and conditions that 
govern  the  conduct  of  such  activities  by  national  banks,"  12 
U. S. C.  $ 24a(g)(3)(A),  see  also  $ 24  Seventh,  OCC  promul-
gated 12 CFR $ 7.4006 (2006): "Unless otherwise provided by 
Federal law or OCC regulation, State laws apply to national 
bank  operating  subsidiaries  to  the  same  extent  that  those 
laws  apply  to  the  parent  national  bank."  See  Investment 
Securities; Bank Activities and Operations; Leasing, 66 Fed. 
Reg. 34784, 34788 (2001).  Watters disputes the authority of 
OCC  to  promulgate  this  regulation  and  contends  that,  be-
cause  preemption  is  a  legal  question  for  determination  by 
courts,  $ 7.4006  should  attract  no  deference.  See  also  post, 
at  38-43.  This  argument  is  beside  the  point,  for  under  our 
interpretation  of  the  statute,  the  level  of  deference  owed 
to  the  regulation  is  an  academic  question.  Section  7.4006 

12 The dissent protests that the GLBA does not itself preempt the Michi-
gan  provisions  at  issue.  Cf.  post,  at  36-38.  We  express  no  opinion  on 
that matter.  Our point is more modest: The GLBA simply demonstrates 
Congress' formal recognition that national banks have incidental power to 
do business through operating subsidiaries.  See supra, at 16-17; cf. post, 
at 30-31.

Opinion of the Court 
merely clarifies and confirms what the NBA already conveys: A national bank has the power to engage in real estate lend-

ing  through  an  operating  subsidiary,  subject  to  the  same terms  and  conditions  that  govern  the  national  bank  itself; 
that  power  cannot  be  significantly  impaired  or  impeded  by state  law.  See,  e. g.,  Barnett  Bank,  517  U. S.,  at  33-34;  12 
U. S. C. $$ 24 Seventh, 24a(g)(3)(A), 371.13 The  NBA  is  thus  properly  read  by  OCC  to  protect  from 
state  hindrance  a  national  bank's  engagement  in  the  "busi-ness of banking" whether conducted by the bank itself or by 
an operating subsidiary, empowered to do only what the bank itself  could  do.  See 

supra,  at  16-17.  The  authority  to  en-gage  in  the  business  of  mortgage  lending  comes  from  the 

NBA,  $ 371,  as  does  the  authority  to  conduct  business through  an  operating  subsidiary.  See  $$ 24  Seventh, 
24a(g)(3)(A).  That  Act  vests  visitorial  oversight  in  OCC, not  state  regulators.  $ 484(a).  State  law  (in  this  case, 
North Carolina law), all agree, governs incorporation-related issues, such as the formation, dissolution, and internal gover-
nance  of  operating  subsidiaries.14  And  the  laws  of  the States  in  which  national  banks  or  their  affiliates  are  located 
govern  matters  the  NBA  does  not  address.  See  supra, at 11.  But state regulators cannot interfere with the "busi-
ness  of  banking"  by  subjecting  national  banks  or  their OCC-licensed  operating  subsidiaries  to  multiple  audits  and 
surveillance under rival oversight regimes. 

13 Because  we  hold  that  the  NBA  itself--independent  of  OCC's  regula-
tion--preempts the application of the pertinent Michigan laws to national 
bank  operating  subsidiaries,  we  need  not  consider  the  dissent's  lengthy 
discourse  on  the  dangers  of  vesting  preemptive  authority  in  administra-
tive  agencies.  See  post,  at  38-43;  cf.  post,  at  43,  44  (maintaining  that 
"[w]hatever the Court says, this is a case about an administrative agency's 
power to preempt state laws," and accusing the Court of "endors[ing] ad-
ministrative  action  whose  sole  purpose  was  to  preempt  state  law  rather 
than to implement a statutory command"). 

14 Watters does not assert that Wachovia Mortgage is out of compliance 

with any North Carolina law governing its corporate status.

METROPHONES  TELECOMMUNICATIONS,  INC. 

Syllabus 

Held:  The FCC's application of $ 201(b) to the carrier's refusal to pay com-

pensation  is  lawful;  and,  given  the  linkage  with  $ 207,  $ 207  authorizes 
this federal-court lawsuit.  Pp. 52-64. 

(a)  The language of $$ 201(b), 206, and 207 and those sections' history, 
including that of their predecessors, Interstate Commerce Act $$ 8 and 
9, make clear that $ 207's purpose is to allow persons injured by $ 201(b) 
violations  to  bring  federal-court  damages  actions.  The  difficult  ques-
tion  is  whether  the  FCC  regulation  at  issue  lawfully  implements 

$ 201(b)'s "unreasonable practice" prohibition.  Pp. 52-55. 

(b)  The FCC's  $ 201(b)  "unreasonable  practice"  determination  is rea-
sonable,  and  thus  lawful.  See  Chevron  U.  S.  A.  Inc.  v.  Natural  Re-
sources  Defense  Council,  Inc.,  467  U. S.  837,  843-844.  It  easily  fits 
within the language of the statutory phrase.  Moreover, the underlying 
regulated  activity  at  issue  resembles  activity  long  regulated  by  both 
transportation  and  communications  agencies.  Traditionally,  the  FCC, 
exercising  its  rate-setting  authority,  has  divided  revenues  from  a  call 
among providers of segments of the call.  Transportation agencies have 
similarly  divided  revenues  from  a  larger  transportation  service  among 
providers  of  segments  of  the  service.  The  payphone  operator  and 
long-distance carrier resemble those joint providers of a communication 
or transportation service.  Differences between the present "unreason-
able practice" classification and more traditional regulatory subject mat-
ter  do  not  require  a  different  outcome.  When  Congress  revised  the 
telecommunications laws in 1996 to enhance the role of competition, cre-
ating a system that relies in part upon competition and in part upon the 
role of tariffs in regulatory supervision, it left $ 201(b) in place.  In light 
of the absence of any congressional prohibition, and the similarities with 
traditional  regulatory  action,  the  Court  finds  nothing  unreasonable 
about the FCC's $ 201(b) determination.  United States v.  Mead Corp., 
533 U. S. 218, 229.  Pp. 55-58. 

(c)  Additional  arguments  made  by  Global  Crossing,  its  supporting 
amici, and the dissents--that $ 207 does not authorize actions for viola-
tions of regulations promulgated to carry out statutory objectives; that 
no $ 207 action lies for violations of substantive regulations promulgated 
by  the  FCC;  that  $$ 201(a)  and  (b)  concern  only  practices  that  harm 
carrier  customers,  not  carrier  suppliers;  that  the  FCC's  "unreasonable 
practice" determination is unlawful because it is inadequately reasoned; 
and that $ 276 prohibits the FCC's $ 201(b) classification--are ultimately 
unpersuasive.  Pp. 58-64. 

423 F. 3d 1056, affirmed.

court lawsuit. 

I 

A 

Because  regulatory  history  helps  to illuminate  the  proper 
interpretation and application of $$ 201(b) and 207, we begin 
with that history.  When Congress enacted the Communica-
tions  Act  of  1934,  it  granted  the  FCC  broad  authority  to 
regulate  interstate  telephone  communications.  See  Louisi-
ana  Pub.  Serv.  Comm'n  v.  FCC,  476  U. S.  355,  360  (1986). 
The  Commission,  during  the  first  several  decades  of  its  his-
tory,  used  this  authority  to  develop  a  traditional  regulatory 
system much like the systems other commissions had applied 
when regulating railroads, public utilities, and other common 
carriers.  A utility or carrier would file with a commission a 
tariff  containing  rates,  and  perhaps  other  practices,  classifi-
cations,  or  regulations  in  connection  with  its  provision  of 
communications  services.  The  commission  would  examine 
the  rates,  etc.,  and,  after  appropriate  proceedings,  approve 
them,  set  them  aside,  or,  sometimes,  set  forth  a  substitute 
rate  schedule  or  list  of  approved  charges,  classifications,  or 
practices  that  the  carrier  or  utility  must  follow.  In  doing 
so, the  commission might  determine  the  utility's  or carrier's 
overall costs (including a reasonable profit), allocate costs to 
particular  services,  examine  whether,  and  how,  individual 
rates  would  generate  revenue  that  would  help  cover  those 
costs,  and,  if  necessary,  provide  for  a  division  of  revenues 
among several carriers that together provided a single serv-
ice.  See  47  U. S. C.  $$ 201(b),  203,  205(a);  Missouri  ex  rel.

Historically  speaking,  the  Interstate  Commerce  Act  sec-
ti ons  changed  early,  preregulatory  common-law  rate-
supervision  procedures.  The  common  law  originally  per-
mitted a freight shipper to ask a court to determine whether 
a railroad rate was unreasonably high and to award the ship-
per damages in the form of "reparations."  The "new" regu-
latory  law,  however,  made  clear  that  a  commission,  not  a 
court,  would  determine  a  rate's  reasonableness.  At  the 
same  time,  that  "new"  law  permitted  a  shipper  injured  by 
an  unreasonable  rate  to  bring  a  federal  lawsuit  to  collect 
damages.  Interstate Commerce Act $$ 1, 8-9; Arizona Gro-

the ICC 61 (1976).  The similar language of Communications Act  $$ 201(b)  and  207  indicates  a  roughly  similar  sharing  of 
agency authority with federal courts. Beginning in the 1970's, the FCC came to believe that com-
munications markets might efficiently support more than one firm  and  that  competition  might  supplement  (or  provide  a 
substitute for) traditional regulation.  See MCI Telecommu-
nications Corp. v.  American Telephone & Telegraph Co., 512 U. S. 218, 220-221 (1994).  The Commission facilitated entry 

of  new  telecommunications  carriers  into  long-distance  mar-kets.  And  in  the  1990's,  Congress  amended  the  1934  Act 
while  also  enacting  new  telecommunications  statutes,  in order to encourage (and sometimes to mandate) new compe-
tition.  See Telecommunications Act of 1996, 110 Stat. 56, 47 U. S. C. $ 609 

et seq.  Neither Congress nor the Commission, however,  totally  abandoned  traditional  regulatory  require-

ments.  And  the  new  statutes  and  amendments  left  many traditional requirements and related statutory provisions, in-
cluding  $$ 201(b)  and  207,  in  place.  E.  g., National Cable &  Telecommunications  Assn.  v.  Brand  X  Internet  Services, 
545 U. S. 967, 975 (2005).  B 

The  regulatory  problem  that  underlies  this  lawsuit  arises at the intersection of traditional regulation and newer, more 
competitively  oriented  approaches.  Competing  long-distance carriers seek the business of individual local callers, 
including  those  who  wish  to  make  a  long-distance  call  from a  local  payphone.  A  payphone  operator,  however,  controls 
what is sometimes a necessary channel for the caller to reach the long-distance carrier.  And prior to 1990, a payphone op-

Opinion of the Court 
erator,  exploiting  this  control,  might  require  a  caller  to  use a long-distance carrier that the operator favored while block-

ing  access to  the  caller's  preferred  carrier.  Such  a  practice substituted  the  operator's  choice  of  carrier  for  the  caller's, 
and it potentially placed disfavored carriers at a competitive disadvantage.  In 1990, Congress enacted special legislation 
requiring  payphone  operators  to  allow  a  payphone  user  to 
obtain  "free"  access  to  the  carrier  of  his  or  her  choice,  i. e., access  from  the  payphone  without  depositing  coins.  Tele-

phone Operator Consumer Services Improvement Act  of 1990,  104  Stat.  986,  note  following  47  U. S. C.  $ 226.  (For 
ease of exposition, we often use familiar terms such as "long 
distance" and "free" calls instead of more precise terms such 
as "interexchange" and "coinless" or "dial-around" calls.) 

At the same time, Congress recognized that the "free" call 
would  impose  a  cost  upon  the  payphone  operator;  and  it 
consequently  required  the  FCC  to  "prescribe  regulations 
that . . . establish a per call compensation plan to ensure that 
all  payphone  service  providers  are  fairly  compensated  for 
each  and  every  completed  intrastate  and  interstate  call." 

$ 276(b)(1)(A)  of  the  Communications  Act  of  1934,  as  added 
by $ 151 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, 110 Stat. 106, 
codified at 47 U. S. C. $ 276(b)(1)(A). 

The  FCC  then  considered  the  compensation  problem. 
Using  traditional  ratemaking  methods,  it  found  that  the 
(fixed and incremental) costs of a "free" call from a payphone 
to,  say,  a  long-distance  carrier  warranted  reimbursement  of 
(at  the  time  relevant  to  this  litigation)  $0.24  per  call.  The 
FCC  ordered  carriers  to  reimburse  the  payphone  operators 
in this amount unless a carrier and an operator agreed upon a 
different amount.  47 CFR $ 64.1300(d) (2005).  At the same 
time,  it  left  the  carriers  free  to  pass  the  cost  along  to  their 
customers,  the  payphone  callers.  Thus,  in  a  typical  "free" 
call,  the  carrier  will  bill  the  caller  and  then  must  share  the 
revenue the carrier receives--to the  tune of $0.24 per call-- 
with the payphone operator that has, together  with the car-

rier,  furnished  a  communications  service  to  the  caller.  The FCC subsequently determined that a carrier's refusal to pay 

the compensation ordered amounts to an "unreasonable prac-tice"  within  the  terms  of  $ 201(b).  (We  shall  refer  to  these 
regulations  as  the  Compensation  Order  and  the  2003  Pay-phone  Order,  respectively.  See  Appendix  A,  infra,  for  full 
citations.)  See generally P. Huber, M. Kellogg, & J. Thorne, Federal Telecommunications Law $ 8.6.3, pp. 710-713 (2d ed. 
1999)  (hereinafter  Huber).  That  determination,  it  believed, would  permit  a  payphone  operator  to  bring  a  federal-court 
lawsuit under  $ 207  to collect the  compensation  owed.  2003 Payphone Order, 18 FCC Rcd. 19975, 19990, || 32.

In  2003,  respondent,  Metrophones  Telecommunications, Inc., a payphone operator, brought this federal-court lawsuit 

against  Global  Crossing  Telecommunications,  Inc.,  a  long-distance  carrier.  Metrophones  sought  compensation  that  it 
said Global Crossing owed it under the FCC's Compensation Order, 14 FCC Rcd. 2545 (1999).  Insofar as is relevant here, 
Metrophones  claimed  that  Global  Crossing's  refusal  to  pay amounted to a violation of $ 201(b), thereby  permitting Met-
rophones to sue in federal court, under $ 207, for the compen-sation  owed.  The  District  Court  agreed.  423  F.  3d  1056, 
1061  (CA9  2005).  The  Ninth  Circuit  affirmed  the  District Court's  determination.  Ibid.  We  granted  certiorari to  de-
termine whether $ 207 authorizes the lawsuit.

Section 207 says that "[a]ny person claiming to be damaged by  any common  carrier .  .  .  may bring  suit"  against  the  car-

rier "in any district court of the United States" for "recovery of the damages for which such common carrier may be liable 
under the provisions of this chapter."  47 U. S. C. $ 207 (em-phasis  added).  This  language  makes  clear  that  the  lawsuit

Opinion of the Court 
is  proper  if  the  FCC  could  properly  hold  that  a  carrier's failure  to  pay  compensation  is  an  "unreasonable  practice" 

deemed  "unlawful"  under  $ 201(b).  That  is  because  the  im-mediately  preceding  section,  $ 206,  says  that  a  common  car-
rier  is  "liable"  for  "damages  sustained  in  consequence  of " the  carrier's  doing  "

any  act,  matter,  or  thing  in  this  chap-
ter  prohibited  or  declared  to  be  unlawful."  And  $ 201(b) 
declares  "unlawful"  any  common-carrier  "charge,  practice, classification,  or regulation 

that is unjust or unreasonable." 
(See  Appendix  B,  in f ra,  for  full  text;  emphasis  added throughout.) 

The history of these sections--including that of their pred-
ecessors, $$ 8 and 9 of the Interstate Commerce Act--simply 
reinforces  the  language,  making  clear  the  purpose  of  $ 207 
is  to  allow  persons  injured  by  $ 201(b)  violations  to  bring 
federal-court  damages  actions.  See,  e. g.,  Arizona  Grocery 
Co.,  284  U. S.,  at 384-385  (Interstate  Commerce  Act  $$ 8-9); 
Part  I-A,  supra.  History  also  makes  clear  that  the  FCC 
has  long  implemented  $ 201(b)  through  the  issuance  of  rules 
and  regulations.  This  is  obviously  so  when  the  rules  take 
the  form  of  FCC  approval  or  prescription  for  the  future  of 
rates  that  exclusively  are  "reasonable."  See  47  U. S. C. 

$ 205 (authorizing the FCC to prescribe reasonable rates and 
practices  in  order to preclude  rates or practices that  violate 

$ 201(b)); 5 U. S. C. $ 551(4) (" `rule' . . .  includes the approval 
or prescription for the future of rates . . . or  practices").  It 
is also so when the FCC has set forth rules that, for example, 
require  certain  accounting  methods  or  insist  upon  certain 
carrier practices, while (as here) prohibiting others as unjust 
or  unreasonable  under  $ 201(b).  See,  e. g.  (to  name  a  few), 
Verizon  Tel.  Cos.  v.  FCC,  453  F.  3d  487,  494  (CADC  2006) 
(rates unreasonable (and hence unlawful) if not adjusted pur-
suant  to  accounting  rules  ordered  in  FCC  regulations);

Insofar as the statute's language is concerned, to violate a regulation  that  lawfully  implements  $ 201(b)'s  requirements 

is  to  violate  the  statute.  See,  e. g.,  MCI  Telecommunica-
tions Corp., 59 F. 3d, at 1414 ("We have repeatedly held that 
a  rate-of-return  prescription  has  the  force  of  law  and  that 
the  Commission  may  therefore  treat  a  violation  of  the  pre-

munications  Act  that  a  common  carrier  maintain  `just  and 
reasonable'  rates,  see  47  U. S. C.  $ 201(b)");  cf.  Alexander  v. 
Sandoval, 532 U. S. 275, 284 (2001) (it is "meaningless to talk 
about  a  separate  cause  of  action  to  enforce  the  regulations 
apart from the statute").  That is why private litigants have 
long  assumed  that  they  may,  as  the  statute  says,  bring  an 
action  under  $ 207  for  violation  of  a  rule  or  regulation  that 
lawfully  implements  $ 201(b).  See,  e. g.,  Oh  v.  AT&T  Corp., 
76 F. Supp. 2d 551, 556 (NJ 1999) (assuming validity of $ 207 
suit  alleging  violation  of  $ 201(b)  in  carrier's  failure  to  pro-
vide  services  listed  in  FCC-approved  tariff);  Southwestern 
Bell  Tel.  Co.  v.  Allnet  Communications  Servs.,  Inc.,  789 
F.  Supp.  302,  304-306  (ED  Mo.  1992)  (assuming  validity  of

tices  related  to  payment  of  access  charges  by  long-distance 
carrier  to  local  exchange  carrier);  cf.,  e. g.,  Chicago  &  North 
Western Transp. Co. v.  Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co., 609 F. 2d 
1221,  1224-1225  (CA7  1979)  (same  in  respect  to  Interstate 
Commerce Act equivalents of $$ 201(b), 207). 

The  difficult  question,  then,  is  not  whether  $ 207  covers 
actions  that  complain  of  a  violation  of  $ 201(b)  as  lawfully 
implemented by an FCC regulation.  It plainly does.  It re-

Opinion of the Court 
mains  for  us  to  decide  whether  the  particular  FCC  regula-tion  before  us  lawfully  implements  $ 201(b)'s  "unreasonable 

practice" prohibition.  We now turn to that question. 

B 
In our view the FCC's $ 201(b) "unreasonable practice" de-termination  is  a  reasonable  one;  hence  it  is  lawful.  See 

Chevron U. S. A. Inc., 467 U. S., at 843-844.  The determina-tion  easily  fits  within  the  language  of  the  statutory  phrase. 
That  is  to  say,  in  ordinary  English,  one  can  call  a  refusal  to pay  Commission-ordered  compensation  despite  having  re-
ceived a benefit from the payphone operator a "practic[e] . . . in  connection  with  [furnishing  a]  communication  service  .  .  . 
that  is  .  .  .  unreasonable."  The  service  that  the  payphone operator  provides  constitutes  an  integral  part  of  the  total 
long-distance  service  the  payphone  operator  and  the  long-distance  carrier  together  provide  to  the  caller,  with  respect 
to  the  carriage  of  his  or  her  particular  call.  The  carrier's refusal  to  divide  the  revenues  it  receives  from  the  caller 

with  its  collaborator,  the  payphone  operator,  despite  the FCC's  regulation  requiring  it  to  do  so,  can  reasonably  be 
called a "practice" "in connection with" the provision of that service  that  is  "unreasonable."  Cf.  post,  p.  74  (

some  segments  of  a  call  while  requiring  providers  of  other 
segments  to  divide  related  revenues.  See,  e. g.,  Smith  v. 
Illinois  Bell  Telephone  Co.,  282  U. S.  133,  148-151  (1930) 
(communications).  And  traditionally,  transportation  agen-
cies  have  determined  costs  of  providing  some  segments  of 
a  larger  transportation  service  (for  example,  the  cost  of 
providing  the  San  Francisco-Ogden  segment  of  a  San 
Francisco-New York shipment) while requiring providers of 
other segments to divide revenues.  See, e. g., New England 
Divisions Case, 261 U. S. 184 (1923); Chicago & North West-
ern R. Co.,  387 U. S. 326; cf. Cable & Wireless P. L. C., 166 F. 
3d,  at  1231.  In  all  instances  an  agency  allocates  costs  and 
provides for a related sharing of revenues. 

In  these  more  traditional  instances,  transportation  carri-
ers  and  communications  firms  entitled  to  revenues  under 
rate divisions or cost allocations  might bring lawsuits under 

$ 207, or the equivalent sections of the Interstate Commerce 
Act, and obtain compensation or damages.  See, e. g., Allnet 
Communication Serv., Inc. v.  National Exch. Carrier Assn., 
Inc., 965 F. 2d 1118, 1122 (CADC 1992) ($ 207); Southwestern 
Bell Tel. Co., supra, at 305 (same); Chicago & North Western 
Transp.  Co.,  supra,  at  1224-1225  (Interstate  Commerce  Act 
equivalent of $ 207).  Again, the similarities support the rea-
sonableness  of  an  agency's  bringing  about  a  similar  result 
here.  We  do  not  suggest  that  the  FCC  is  required  to  find 
carriers'  failures  to  divide  revenues  to  be  $ 201(b)  violations 
in every instance.  Cf. U. S. Telepacific Corp. v.  Tel-America 
of Salt Lake City, Inc., 19 FCC Rcd. 24552, 24555-24556, and 
n.  27  (2004)  (citing  cases).  Nor  do  we  suggest  that  every 
violation  of  FCC  regulations  is  an  unjust  and  unreasonable 
practice.  Here  there  is  an  explicit  statutory  scheme,  and 
compensation  of  payphone  operators  is  necessary  to  the 
proper  implementation  of  that  scheme.  Under  these  cir-
cumstances,  the  FCC's  finding  that  the  failure  to  follow  the 
order is an unreasonable practice is well within its authority.

Opinion of the Court 
There are, of course, differences between the present "un-reasonable practice" classification and the similar more tradi-

tional  regulatory  subject  matter  we  have  just  described. For  one  thing,  the  connection  between  payphone  operators 
and  long-distance  carriers  is  not  a  traditional  "through route"  between  carriers.  See  $ 201(a).  For  another,  as 
Global  Crossing's  amici  point  out,  the  word  "practice"  in 

$ 201(b)  has  traditionally  applied  to  a  carrier  practice  that (unlike  the  present  one)  is  the  subject  of  a  carrier  tariff-- 

i. e., a carrier agency filing that sets forth the carrier's rates, classifications,  and  practices.  Brief  for  AT&T  et  al.  as 
Amici  Curiae  8-11.  We  concede  the  differences.  Indeed, 
traditionally, the filing of tariffs was "the centerpiece" of the 
"[Communications]  Act's  regulatory  scheme."  MCI  Tele-
communications  Corp.,  512  U. S.,  at  220.  But  we  do  not 
concede  that  these  differences  require  a  different  outcome. 
Statutory  changes  enhancing  the  role  of  competition  have 
radically  reduced  the  role  that  tariffs  play  in  regulatory  su-
pervision  of  what  is  now  a  mixed  communications  system-- 
a  system  that  relies  in  part  upon  competition  and  in  part 
upon  more  traditional  regulation.  Yet  when  Congress  re-
wrote  the  law  to  bring  about  these  changes,  it  nonetheless 
left  $ 201(b)  in  place.  That  fact  indicates  that  the  statute 
permits,  indeed  it  suggests  that  Congress  likely  expected, 
the FCC to pour new substantive wine into its old regulatory 
bottles.  See  Policy  and  Rules  Concerning  the  Interstate, 
Interexchange  Marketplace,  12  FCC  Rcd.  15014,  15057,  || 77 
(1997)  (despite  the  absence  of  tariffs,  FCC's  $ 201  enforce-
ment  obligations  have  not  diminished);  Boomer  v.  AT&T 
Corp.,  309  F.  3d  404,  422  (CA7  2002)  (same).  And  this  cir-
cumstance,  by  indicating  that  Congress  did  not  forbid  the 
agency  to  apply  $ 201(b)  differently  in  the  changed  regula-
tory environment, is sufficient to convince us that the FCC's 
determination is lawful. 

That is because we have made clear that where "Congress 
would  expect  the  agency  to  be  able  to  speak  with  the  force

of  law  when  it  addresses  ambiguity  in  the  statute  or  fills  a space  in  the  enacted  law,"  a  court  "is  obliged  to  accept  the 

agency's  position  if  Congress  has  not  previously  spoken  to the  point  at  issue  and  the  agency's  interpretation"  (or  the 
manner  in  which  it  fills  the  "gap")  is  "reasonable."  United States  v.  Mead  Corp.,  533  U. S.  218,  229  (2001);  National 
Cable & Telecommunications Assn., 545 U. S., at 980; Chev-
ron  U.  S.  A.  Inc.,  467  U. S.,  at  843-844.  Congress,  in $ 201(b),  delegated  to  the  agency  authority  to  "fill"  a  "gap," 

i. e.,  to  apply  $ 201  through  regulations  and  orders  with  the force of law.  National Cable & Telecommunications Assn., 
supra,  at  980-981.  The  circumstances  mentioned  above make clear the absence of any relevant congressional prohibi-
tion.  And, in  light  of the  traditional regulatory  similarities that  we  have  discussed,  we  can  find  nothing  unreasonable 
about the FCC's $ 201(b) determination. 

C 
Global  Crossing,  its  supporting  amici,  and  the  dissents make  several  additional  but  ultimately  unpersuasive  argu-

ments.  First,  Global  Crossing  claims  that  $ 207  authorizes only  actions  "seeking  damages  for 

statutory violations"  and not  for  "violations  merely  of  regulations  promulgated  to 

carry out statutory objectives."  Brief for Petitioner 12 (em-phasis in original).  The lawsuit before us, however, "seek[s] 
damages  for  [a]  statutory violatio[n],"  namely,  a  violation  of $ 201(b)'s  prohibition  of  an  "unreasonable  practice."  As  we 
have pointed out, supra, at 53-54, $ 201(b)'s prohibitions have long been thought to extend to rates that diverge from FCC 
prescriptions,  as  well  as  rates  or  practices  that  are  "unrea-sonable"  in  light  of their  failure  to reflect  rules embodied  in 
an  agency  regulation.  We  have  found  no  limitation  of  the 
kind Global Crossing suggests. Global Crossing seeks  to draw  support from

rett,  494  U. S.  638  (1990),  which,  Global  Crossing  says,  hold 
that an agency cannot determine through regulation when a 
private party may bring a federal court action.  Those cases 
do  involve  private  actions,  but  they  do  not  support  Global 
Crossing.  The cases involve different statutes and different 
regulations, and the Court made clear in each of those cases 
that  its  holding  relied  on  the  specific  statute  before  it.  In 
Sandoval, supra, at 288-289, the Court found that an implied 
right of action to enforce one statutory provision, 42 U. S. C. 

$ 2000d, did not extend to regulations implementing another, 

$ 2000d-1.  In  contrast,  here  we  are  addressing  the  FCC's 
reasonable  interpretation  of  ambiguous  language  in  a  sub-
stantive  statutory provision,  47 U. S. C. $ 201(b), which  Con-
gress  expressly  linked  to  the  right  of  action  provided  in 

$ 207.  Nothing  in  Sandoval  requires  us  to  limit  our  defer-
ence  to  the  FCC's  reasonable  interpretation  of  $ 201(b);  to 
the  contrary, as  we  noted  in Sandoval,  it is  "meaningless to 
talk  about  a  separate  cause  of  action  to  enforce  the  regula-
tions  apart  from  the  statute.  A  Congress  that  intends  the 
statute  to  be  enforced  through  a  private  cause  of  action  in-
tends the authoritative interpretation of the statute to be so 
enforced  as  well."  532  U. S.,  at  284.  In  Adams  Fruit  Co., 
supra,  at  646-647,  we  rejected  an  agency  interpretation  of 
the  worker-protection  statute  at  issue  as  contrary  to  "the 
plain  meaning  of  the  statute's  language."  Given  the  differ-
ences  in  statutory  language,  context,  and  history,  those  two 
cases are simply beside the point. 

Our  analysis  does  not  change  in  this  case  simply  because 
the  practice  deemed  unreasonable  (and  hence  unlawful)  in 
the 2003 Payphone Order is in violation of an FCC regulation 
adopted  under  authority  of  a  separate  statutory  section, 

$ 276.  The  FCC  here,  acting  under  the  authority  of  $ 276, 
has  prescribed  a  particular  rate (and  a division  of revenues) 
applicable  to  a  portion  of  a  long-distance  service,  and  it  has 
ordered  carriers  to  reimburse  payphone  operators  for  the

Opinion of the Court 

relevant portion of the service they jointly provide.  But the 
conclusion that it is "unreasonable" to fail so to reimburse is 
not a $ 276 conclusion; it is a $ 201(b) conclusion.  And courts 
have  treated  a  carrier's  failure  to  follow  closely  analogous 
agency rate and rate-division determinations as we treat the 
matter  at  issue  here.  That  is  to  say,  the  FCC  properly  im-
plements $ 201(b) when it reasonably finds that the failure to 
follow  a  Commission,  e. g.,  rate  or  rate-division  determina-
tion  made  under  a  different statutory  provision  is  unjust  or 
unreasonable  under  $ 201(b).  See,  e. g.,  MCI  Telecommuni-
cations Corp., 59  F. 3d,  at  1414  (failure  to  follow a  rate  pro-
mulgated  under  $ 205  properly  considered  unreasonable 
under  $ 201(b));  see  also  Baltimore  &  O.  R.  Co.  v.  Alabama 
Great  Southern  R.  Co.,  506  F.  2d  1265,  1270  (CADC  1974) 
(statutory  obligation  to  provide  reasonable  rate  divisions  is 
"implemented  by  orders  of  the  ICC"  issued  pursuant  to  a 
separate statutory provision).  Moreover, in resting our con-
clusion upon the analogy with rate setting and rate divisions, 
the traditional, historical subject matter of $ 201(b), we avoid 
authorizing  the  FCC  to  turn  $$ 201(b)  and  207  into  a  back-
door remedy for violation of FCC regulations.

must  compensate  payphone  operators.  The  only  practice 
before us, then, and the only one we consider, is the carrier's 
violation of that FCC regulation requiring the carrier to pay 
the payphone operator a fair portion of the total cost of car-
rying  a call that  they  jointly  carried--each  supplying a  par-
tial portion of the total carriage.  A practice of violating the 
FCC's order to pay a fair share would seem fairly character-
ized  in  ordinary  English  as  an  "unjust  practice,"  so  why 
should the FCC not call it the same under $ 201(b)?

likely have harmed another carrier, not a shipper.  See, e. g., 
Chicago  &  North  Western  Transp.  Co.,  609  F.  2d,  at  1225, 
1226  ("Act  .  .  .  provides  for  the  regulation  of  inter-carrier 
relations  as  a  part  of  its  general  rate  policy").  Once  one 
takes account of this fact, it seems reasonable, not unreason-
able, to include as a $ 201(b) (and $ 207) beneficiary a firm that 
performs services roughly analogous to the transportation of 
one segment of a longer call.  We are not here dealing with 
a firm that supplies office supplies or manual labor.  Cf., e. g., 
Missouri Pacific R. Co. v.  Norwood, 283 U. S. 249, 257 (1931) 
("practice"  in  $ 1  of  the  Interstate  Commerce  Act  does  not 
encompass  employment  decisions).  The  long-distance  car-
rier ordered by the FCC to compensate the payphone opera-
tor is  so ordered  in  its  role  as a provider  of communications 
services, not as a consumer of office supplies or the like.  It 
is  precisely  because  the  carrier  and  the  payphone  operator 
jointly  provide  a  communications  service  to  the  caller  that 
the  carrier  is  ordered  to  share  with  the  payphone  operator 
the  revenue  that  only  the  carrier  is  permitted  to  demand 
from the  caller.  Cf. Cable  &  Wireless P.  L. C., 166  F. 3d,  at 
1231  (finding  that  $ 201(b)  enables  the  Commission  to  regu-
late  not  "only  the  terms  on  which  U.  S.  carriers  offer  tele-
communication  services  to  the  public,"  but  also  "the  prices 
U.  S.  carriers  pay"  to  foreign  carriers  providing  the  foreign 
segment of an international call). 

Fourth, Global Crossing argues that the FCC's "unreason-
able  practice"  determination  is  unlawful  because  it  is  inade-
quately reasoned.  We concede that the FCC's initial opinion 
simply  states  that  the  carrier's  practice  is  unreasonable 
under  $ 201(b).  But  the  context  and  cross-referenced  opin-
ions, 2003 Payphone Order, 18 FCC Rcd., at 19990, || 32 (cit-
ing American Public Communications Council v.  FCC, 215 
F. 3d 51, 56 (CADC 2000)), make the FCC's rationale obvious, 
namely,  that  in  light  of  the  history  that  we  set  forth  supra, 
at 53-54, it is unreasonable for a carrier to violate the FCC's

mandate  that  it  pay  compensation.  See  also  In  re  APCC 
Servs.,  Inc.  v.  NetworkIP,  LLC,  21  FCC  Rcd.  10488,  10493- 
10495, |||| 13-16 (2006) (spelling out the reasoning). 

Fifth,  Global  Crossing  argues  that  a  different  statutory 
provision, $ 276, see supra, at 51, prohibits the FCC's $ 201(b) 
classification.  Brief for Petitioner 26-28.  But $ 276 simply 
requires  the  FCC  to  "take  all  actions  necessary  .  .  .  to  pre-
scribe regulations that . . . establish a per call compensation 
plan to ensure" that payphone operators "are fairly compen-
sated."  47 U. S. C. $ 276(b)(1).  It nowhere forbids the FCC 
to  rely  on  $ 201(b).  Rather,  by  helping  to  secure  enforce-
ment  of  the  mandated  regulations  the  FCC  furthers  basic 

$ 276 purposes. 

Finally,  Global  Crossing  seeks  to  rest  its  claim  of  a  $ 276 
prohibition upon the fact that $ 276 requires regulations that 
secure  compensation  for  "every  completed  intrastate," as  
well  as  every  "interstate,"  payphone-related  call,  while 

$ 201(b)  (referring  to  $ 201(a))  extends  only  to  "interstate 
or  foreign"  communication.  Brief  for  Petitioner  37.  But 
Global  Crossing  makes  too  much  of  too  little.  We  can  as-
sume  (for  argument's  sake)  that  $ 201(b)  may  consequently 
apply only to a portion of the Compensation Order's require-
ments.  But  cf.,  e. g.,  Louisiana  Pub.  Serv.  Comm'n,  476 
U. S.,  at  375,  n.  4  (suggesting  approval  of  FCC  authority 
where  it  is  "not  possible  to  separate  the  interstate  and  the 
intrastate  components").  But  even  if  that is  so  (and  we  re-
peat that we do not decide this question), the FCC's classifi-
cation  will  help  to  achieve  a  substantial  portion  of  its  $ 276 
compensatory  mission.  And  we  cannot  imagine  why  Con-
gress  would  have  (implicitly  in  this  $ 276  language)  wished 
to  prohibit  the  FCC  from  concluding  that  an  interstate  half 
loaf is better than none. 

For  these  reasons,  the  judgment  of  the  Ninth  Circuit  is 
affirmed. 

It is so ordered.

disparity between the highest and lowest of the remaining districts was 
less  than  25  percent,  the  State's  program  "equalize[d]  expenditures," 
and the State could offset federal impact aid by reducing its aid to indi-
vidual  districts.  Seeking  further  review,  petitioner  school  districts 
(Zuni) claimed that the calculations were correct under the regulations, 
but that the regulations were inconsistent with the authorizing statute 
because the Department must calculate the 95th and 5th percentile cut-
offs  based  solely  on  the  number  of  school  districts  without  considering 
the number of pupils in those districts.  A Department Administrative 
Law  Judge  and  the  Secretary  both  rejected  this  challenge,  and  the  en 
banc Tenth Circuit ultimately affirmed. 

Held:  The  statute  permits  the  Secretary  to  identify  the  school  districts 

that should be "disregard[ed]" by looking to the number of the district's 
pupils  as  well  as  to  the  size  of  the  district's  expenditures  per  pupil. 
Pp. 89-100. 

(a)  The "disregard" instruction's history and purpose indicate that the 
Secretary's  calculation  formula  is  a  reasonable  method  that  carries out 
Congress'  likely  intent  in  enacting  the  statutory  provision.  For  one 
thing, that method is the kind of highly technical, specialized interstitial 
matter that Congress does not decide itself, but delegates to specialized 
agencies to decide.  For another, the statute's history strongly supports 
the Secretary.  The present statutory language originated in draft leg-
islation sent by the Secretary himself, which Congress adopted without 
comment or clarification.  No one at the time--no Member of Congress, 
no  Department  of  Education  official,  no  school  district  or  State--ex-
pressed the view that this statutory language was intended to require, 
or did require, the Secretary to change the Department's system of cal-
culation,  a  system  that  the  Department  and  school  districts  across  the 
Nation  had  followed  for  nearly  20  years.  Finally,  the  purpose  of  the 
disregard  instruction,  which  is  evident  in  the  language  of  the  present 
statute, is to exclude statistical  outliers.  Viewed  in  terms  of this pur-
pose, the Secretary's calculation method is reasonable, while the reason-
ableness  of  Zuni's  proposed  method  is  more  doubtful  as  the  thenCommissioner of Education explained when he considered the matter in 
1976.  Pp. 89-93. 

(b)  The Secretary's method falls within the scope of the statute's plain 
language.  Neither the legislative history nor the reasonableness of the 
Secretary's  method  would  be  determinative  if  the  statute's  plain  lan-
guage unambiguously indicated Congress' intent to foreclose the Secre-
tary's  interpretation.  See  Chevron  U. S. A.  Inc.  v.  Natural  Resources

Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 842-843.  That is not the case here. 
Section  7709(b)(2)(B)(i)'s  phrase  "above  the  95th  percentile . . . of . . .  
[per-pupil] expenditures" (emphasis added) limits the Secretary to cal-
culation methods involving per-pupil expenditures.  It does not tell the 
Secretary which of several possible methods the Department must use, 
nor rule out the Secretary's present formula, which distributes districts 
in  accordance  with  per-pupil  expenditures,  while  essentially  weighting 
each district to reflect the number of pupils it contains.  This interpre-
tation is supported by dictionary definitions of "percentile," and by the 
fact that Congress, in other statutes, has clarified the matter at issue to 
avoid  comparable ambiguity.  Moreover,  "[a]mbiguity is  a  creature  not 
[just]  of  definitional  possibilities  but  [also]  of  statutory  context." 
Brown v.  Gardner, 513 U. S. 115, 118.  Context here indicates that both 
students and school districts are of concern to the statute, and, thus, the 
disregard  instruction  can  include  within  its  scope  the  distribution  of  a 
ranked  population  consisting  of  pupils  (or  of  school  districts  weighted 
by pupils), not just a ranked distribution of unweighted school districts 
alone.  Finally,  this  Court  is  reassured  by  the  fact  that  no  group  of 
statisticians,  nor  any  individual  statistician,  has  said  directly  in  briefs, 
or  indirectly  through  citation,  that  the  language  in  question  cannot  be 
read the way it is interpreted here.  Pp. 93-100.

Opinion of the Court 
local  schools  must  educate.  See  $ 7701  (2000  ed.  and  Supp. IV).  The statute typically prohibits a State from offsetting 

this  federal  aid  by  reducing  its  own  state  aid  to  the  local district.  If applied without exceptions, however, this prohi-
bition  might  unreasonably  interfere  with  a  state  program that seeks to equalize per-pupil expenditures throughout the 
State,  for  instance,  by  preventing  the  state  program  from taking account of a significant source of federal funding that 
some  local  school  districts  receive.  The  statute  conse-quently  contains  an  exception  that  permits  a  State  to  com-
pensate for federal impact aid where "the Secretary [of Edu-cation]  determine[s]  and  certifies  .  .  .  that  the  State  has  in 
effect  a  program  of  State  aid  that  equalizes  expenditures for free public education among local [school districts] in the 
State."  $ 7709(b)(1)  (2000  ed.,  Supp.  IV)  (emphasis  added). The statute sets out  a formula  that  the Secretary  of Edu-
cation  must  use  to  determine  whether  a  state  aid  program satisfies  the  federal  "equaliz[ation]"  requirement.  The  for-
mula instructs the Secretary to compare the local school dis-trict  with  the  greatest  per-pupil  expenditures  to  the  school 
district  with  the  smallest  per-pupil  expenditures  to  see whether the former exceeds the latter by more than 25 per-
cent.  So long as it does not, the state aid program qualifies as  a  program  that  "equalizes  expenditures."  More  specifi-
cally the statute provides that "a program of state aid" quali-fies,  i. e.,  it  "equalizes  expenditures"  among  local  school  dis-

OF  EDUCATION 

Opinion of the Court 

The statutory provision goes on to set forth what we shall 
call the "disregard" instruction.  It states that, when "mak-
ing" this "determination," the "Secretary shall . . . disregard 
[school districts] with per-pupil expenditures . . . above  the  
95th  percentile  or  below  the  5th  percentile  of  such  expendi-
tures."  $ 7709(b)(2)(B)(i)  (emphasis  added).  It  adds  that 
the Secretary shall further 

"take  into  account  the  extent  to  which  [the  state  pro-
gram  reflects  the  special  additional  costs  that  some 
school districts must bear when they are] geographically 
isolated  [or  when  they  provide  education  for]  particular 
types  of  students,  such  as  children  with  disabilities."

This  case  requires  us  to  decide  whether  the  Secretary's 
present  calculation  method  is  consistent  with  the  federal 
statute's  "disregard"  instruction.  The  method  at  issue  is 
contained in a set of regulations that the Secretary first pro-
mulgated  30 years  ago.  Those  regulations  essentially  state 
the following: 

When determining whether a state aid program "equalizes 
expenditures"  (thereby  permitting  the  State  to  reduce  its 
own local funding on account of federal impact aid), the Sec-
retary  will  first  create  a  list  of  school  districts  ranked  in 
order  of  per-pupil  expenditure.  The  Secretary  will  then 
identify  the  relevant  percentile  cutoff  point  on  that  list  on 
the basis of a specific (95th or 5th) percentile of student popu-
lation--essentially  identifying  those  districts  whose  stu-
dents  account  for  the  5  percent  of  the  State's  total  student 
population  that  lies  at  both  the  high  and  low  ends  of  the 
spending  distribution.  Finally  the  Secretary  will  compare 
the highest  spending and lowest spending  school districts of 
those  that  remain  to  see  whether  they  satisfy  the  statute's 
requirement  that  the  disparity  between  them  not  exceed  25 
percent.

Opinion of the Court 
The regulations set forth this calculation method as 
follows: 

"[D]eterminations  of  disparity  in  current  expenditures 
. . . per-pupil are made by-- 

"(i)  Ranking all [of the State's school districts] on the 
basis  of current  expenditures  . .  .  per  pupil  [in the  rele-
vant statutorily determined year]; 

"(ii)  Identifying those [school districts] that fall at the 
95th  and  5th  percentiles  of  the  total  number  of  pupils 
in  attendance  [at  all  the  State's  school  districts  taken 
together]; and 

"(iii)  Subtracting  the  lower  current  expenditure  .  .  . 
per  pupil  figure  from  the  higher  for  those  [school  dis-
tricts] identified in paragraph (ii) and dividing the differ-
ence  by  the  lower  figure."  34  CFR  pt.  222,  subpt.  K, 
App., || 1 (2006). 

The regulations also provide an illustration of how to per-
form the calculation: 

"In  State  X,  after  ranking  all  [school  districts]  in  order 
of  the  expenditures  per  pupil  for  the  [statutorily  deter-
mined] fiscal year in question, it is ascertained by count-
ing  the  number  of  pupils  in  attendance  in  those  [school 
districts] in ascending order of expenditure that the 5th 
percentile of student population is reached at [school dis-
trict  A]  with  a  per  pupil  expenditure  of  $820,  and  that 
the  95th  percentile  of  student  population  is  reached  at 
[school district B] with a per pupil expenditure of $1,000.

OF  EDUCATION 

Opinion of the Court 

C 
This case concerns the Department of Education's applica-tion of the Secretary's regulations to New Mexico's local dis-

trict aid program in respect to fiscal year 2000.  As the reg-ulations  require,  Department  officials  listed  each  of  New 
Mexico's 89 local school districts in order of per-pupil spend-ing  for  fiscal  year  1998.  (The  calculation  in  New  Mexico's 
case  was  performed,  as  the  statute  allows,  on  the  basis  of per-pupil 

revenues, rather than per-pupil expenditures.  See 20  U. S. C.  $ 7709(b)(2)(A).  See  also  Appendix  B,  infra. 

For  ease  of  reference  we  nevertheless  refer,  in  respect  to New  Mexico's  figures  and  throughout  the  opinion,  only  to 
"per-pupil  expenditures.")  After  ranking  the  districts,  De-partment  officials  excluded  17  school  districts  at  the  top  of 
the  list  because  those  districts  contained  (cumulatively)  less than 5 percent of the student population; for the same reason, 
they  excluded  an  additional  6  school  districts  at  the  bottom of the list. 

The remaining 66 districts accounted for approximately 90 percent  of  the  State's  student  population.  Of  those,  the 
highest  ranked  district  spent  $3,259  per  student;  the  lowest ranked  district  spent  $2,848  per  student.  The  difference, 
$411, was less than 25 percent of the lowest per-pupil figure, namely, $2,848.  Hence, the officials found that New Mexico's 
local  aid  program  qualifies  as  a  program  that  "equalizes  ex-penditures."  New  Mexico  was  therefore  free  to  offset  fed-
eral  impact  aid  to  individual  districts  by  reducing  state  aid to those districts. 

Two  of  New  Mexico's  public  school  districts,  Zuni  Public School  District  and  Gallup-McKinley  County  Public  School 
District  (whom  we  shall  collectively  call  Zuni),  sought  fur-ther  agency  review  of  these  findings.  Zuni  conceded  that 
the  Department's  calculations  were  correct  in  terms  of  the Department's  own regulations.  Zuni  argued,  however, that 
the regulations themselves are inconsistent with the author-izing statute.  That statute, in its view, requires the Depart-

Opinion of the Court 
ment  to  calculate  the  95th  and  5th  percentile  cutoffs  solely on the basis of the number of school districts (ranked by their 

per-pupil  expenditures),  without  any  consideration  of  the number  of  pupils  in  those  districts.  If  calculated  as  Zuni 
urges, only 10 districts (accounting for less than 2 percent of all  students)  would  have  been  identified  as  the  outliers  that 
the statute instructs the Secretary to disregard.  The differ-ence,  as  a  result,  between  the  highest  and  lowest  per-pupil 
expenditures of the  remaining districts (26.9  percent) would exceed  25  percent.  Consequently,  the  statute  would  forbid 
New  Mexico  to  take  account  of  federal  impact  aid  as  it  de-cides  how  to  equalize  school  funding  across  the  State.  See 
N. M. Stat. Ann. $ 22-8-1 et seq. (2006). A Department of Education Administrative Law Judge re-
jected Zuni's challenge to the regulations.  The Secretary of Education  did  the  same.  Zuni  sought  review  of  the  Secre-
tary's decision in the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. 393  F.  3d  1158  (2004).  Initially,  a  Tenth  Circuit  panel  af-
firmed the Secretary's determination by a split vote (2 to 1). Subsequently,  the  full  Court  of  Appeals  vacated  the  panel's 
decision  and  heard  the  matter  en  banc.  The  12-member  en banc  court  affirmed  the  Secretary  but  by  an  evenly  divided 
court  (6  to  6).  437  F.  3d  1289  (2006)  (per  curiam).  Zuni sought certiorari.  We agreed to decide the matter. 

II 

A 

Zuni's strongest  argument  rests  upon  the  literal  language of  the  statute.  Zuni  concedes,  as  it  must,  that  if  the  lan-

guage  of  the  statute  is  open  or  ambiguous--that  is,  if  Con-gress left a "gap" for the agency to fill--then we must uphold 
the  Secretary's  interpretation  as  long  as  it  is  reasonable. See 

Chevron  U.  S.  A.  Inc.  v.  Natural  Resources  Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 842-843 (1984).  See also Chris-

poses of exposition, we depart from a normal order of discus-sion,  namely,  an  order  that  first  considers  Zuni's  statutory 

language argument.  See Barnhart v.  Sigmon Coal Co., 534 U. S.  438,  450  (2002).  Instead,  because  of  the  technical  na-
ture  of  the  language  in  question,  we  shall  first  examine  the provision's background and basic purposes.  That discussion 
will  illuminate  our  subsequent  analysis  in  Part  II-B,  infra. 
It will also reveal why Zuni concentrates its argument upon language alone. 

Considerations  other  than  language  provide  us  with  un-usually  strong  indications  that  Congress  intended  to  leave 
the  Secretary  free  to  use  the  calculation  method  before  us 
and  that  the  Secretary's  chosen  method  is  a  reasonable  one. 
For  one  thing,  the  matter  at  issue--i. e.,  the  calculation 
method for determining whether a state aid program "equal-
izes  expenditures"--is  the  kind  of  highly  technical,  special-
ized  interstitial  matter  that  Congress  often  does  not  decide 
itself,  but  delegates  to  specialized  agencies  to  decide.  See 
United  States  v.  Mead  Corp.,  533  U. S.  218,  234  (2001);

Opinion of the Court 
With one minor change (irrelevant to the present calculation controversy),  Congress  adopted  that  language  without  com-

ment  or  clarification.  No  one  at  the  time--no  Member  of Congress, no Department of Education official, no school dis-
trict  or  State--expressed  the  view  that  this  statutory  lan-guage  (which,  after  all,  was  supplied  by  the  Secretary)  was 
intended  to  require,  or  did  require,  the  Secretary  to  change 
the  Department's  system  of  calculation,  a  system  that  the Department  and  school  districts  across  the  Nation  had  fol-

lowed for nearly 20 years, without (as far as we are told) any adverse effect. 

Finally,  viewed  in  terms  of  the  purpose  of  the  statute's 
disregard  instruction,  the  Secretary's  calculation  method  is 
reasonable, while the reasonableness of a method based upon 
the  number  of  districts  alone  (Zuni's  proposed  method)  is 
more doubtful.  When the Secretary (then Commissioner) of 
Education  considered  the  matter  in  1976,  he  explained  why 
that is so. 

Initially  the  Secretary  pointed  out  that  the  "exclusion  of 
the  upper  and  bottom  5  percentile  school  districts  is  based 
upon the accepted principle of statistical evaluation that such 
percentiles  usually  represent  unique  or  noncharacteristic 
situations."  41  Fed.  Reg.  26320  (1976)  (emphasis  added). 
That purpose, a purpose to exclude statistical outliers, is evi-
dent  in  the  language  of  the  present  statute.  The  provision 
uses the  technical term "percentile"; it  refers to cutoff  num-
bers ("95th" and "5th") often associated with scientific calcu-
lations;  and  it  directly  precedes  another  statutory  provision 
that  tells  the  Secretary  to  account  for  those  districts,  from 
among  the  middle  5th  to  95th  percentile  districts,  that  re-
main  "noncharacteristic"  in  respect  to  geography  or  the 
presence  of  special  students  (such  as  disabled  students). 
See 20 U. S. C. $$ 7709(b)(2)(B)(i)-(ii) (2000 ed.). 

The  Secretary  added  that  under  the  regulation's  calcula-
tion  system  the  "percentiles"  would  be  "determined  on  the 
basis  of  numbers  of  pupils  and  not  on  the  basis  of  numbers

Opinion of the Court 

of districts."  41 Fed. Reg. 26324.  He said that to base "an exclusion on numbers of districts" alone "would act to apply 

the  disparity  standard  in  an  unfair  and  inconsistent  man-ner  among  States." 

Ibid.  He  then  elaborated  upon  his 
concerns: 

"The  purpose  of  the  exclusion  is  to  eliminate  those 
anomalous  characteristics  of  a  distribution  of  expendi-tures.  In States with a small number of large districts, 

an  exclusion  based  on  percentage  of  school  districts might  exclude  from  the measure  of  disparity  a  substan-
tial  percentage  of  the  pupil  population  in  those  States. Conversely,  in  States  with  large  numbers  of  small  dis-
tricts,  such  an  approach  might  exclude  only  an  insig-
nificant  fraction  of  the  pupil  population  and  would  not exclude anomalous characteristics." 

Ibid. 

To  understand  the  Secretary's  first  problem,  consider  an 
exaggerated example, say, a State with 80 school districts of unequal size.  Suppose 8 of the districts include urban areas 

and  together  account  for  70  percent  of  the  State's  students, while the remaining 72 districts include primarily rural areas 
and  together  account  for  30  percent  of  the  State's  students. 
If  the  State's  greatest  funding  disparities  are  among  the  8 urban  districts,  Zuni's  calculation  method  (which  looks  only 

at  the  number  of  districts  and  ignores  their  size)  would  re-quire  the  Secretary  to  disregard  the  system's  8  largest  dis-
tricts  (i. e.,  10  percent  of  the  number  80)  even  though  those 8  districts  (because  they  together  contain  70  percent  of 

the  State's  pupils)  are  typical  of,  indeed  characterize,  the State's  public  school  system.  It  would  require  the  Secre-
tary  instead  to  measure  the  system's  expenditure  equality 
by  looking  only  to  noncharacteristic  districts  that  are  not 
representative  of  the  system  as  a  whole,  indeed  districts 
accounting  for  only  30  percent  of  the  State's  pupils.  Thus, 
according to Zuni's method, the Secretary would have to cer-
tify a state aid program as one that "equalizes expenditures"

93 Cite as: 550 U. S. 81 (2007) 
Opinion of the Court 
even  if  there  were  gross  disparities  in  per-pupil  expendi-tures  among  urban  districts  accounting  for  70  percent  of 

the  State's  students.  By  way  of  contrast,  the  Secretary's method, by taking into account a district's size as well as its 
expenditures,  would  avoid  a  calculation  that  would  produce results so contrary to the statute's objective. 

To  understand  the  Secretary's  second  problem  consider this  very  case.  New  Mexico's  89  school  districts  vary  sig-
nificantly  in  respect  to  the  number  of  pupils  each  contains. Zuni's  calculation  system  nonetheless  forbids  the  Secretary 
to  discount  more  than  10  districts--10  percent  of  the  total number of districts (rounded up).  But these districts taken 
together  account  for  only  1.8  percent  of  the  State's  pupils. To  eliminate  only  those  districts,  instead  of  eliminating  dis-
tricts  that  together  account  for  10  percent  of  the  State's pupils,  risks  resting  the  "disregard"  calculation  upon  a  few 
particularly  extreme  noncharacteristic  districts,  yet  again contrary to the statute's intent. 

Thus, the history and purpose of the disregard instruction indicate that the Secretary's calculation formula is a reason-
able method that carries out Congress' likely intent in enact-ing the statutory provision before us. 

B 
But what of the  provision's literal language?  The matter is important, for normally neither the legislative history nor 

the  reasonableness  of  the  Secretary's  method  would  be  de-terminative  if  the  plain  language  of  the  statute  unambigu-
ously indicated  that Congress  sought to foreclose the  Secre-tary's interpretation.  And Zuni argues that the Secretary's 
formula  could  not  possibly  effectuate  Congress'  intent  since the  statute's  language  literally  forbids  the  Secretary  to  use 
such a method.  Under this Court's precedents, if the intent of  Congress  is  clear  and  unambiguously  expressed  by  the 
statutory  language  at  issue,  that  would  be  the  end  of  our analysis.  See

statute that imposes a tariff on "clothing" does not impose a tariff on automobiles, no matter how strong the policy argu-

ments  for  treating  the  two  kinds  of  goods  alike.  But  we disagree with Zuni's conclusion, for we believe that the  Sec-
retary's  method  falls  within  the  scope  of  the  statute's  plain language. 

That language says that, when the Secretary compares (for 
a specified fiscal year) "the amount of per-pupil expenditures made  by"  (1)  the  highest-per-pupil-expenditure  district  and 

(2)  the  lowest-per-pupil-expenditure  district,  "the  Secretary shall . . . disregard" local school districts "with per-pupil ex-
penditures  .  .  .  above  the  95th  percentile  or  below  the  5th 
percentile  of  such  expenditures  in  the  State."  20  U. S. C. 

$$ 7709(b)(2)(A), (B)(i).  The word "such" refers to "per-pupil 
expenditures" (or more precisely to "per-pupil expenditures" 
in the test year specified by the statute).  The question then 
is  whether  the  phrase  "above  the  95th  percentile  . . .  of . . .  
[per pupil] expenditures" permits the Secretary to calculate 
percentiles  by  (1)  ranking  local  districts,  (2)  noting  the  stu-
dent population of each district, and (3) determining the cut-
off point on  the basis of districts containing  95 percent (or 5 
percent) of the State's students. 

Our answer is that this phrase, taken with absolute literal-
ness, limits the Secretary to calculation methods that involve 
"per-pupil expenditures."  But it does not tell the Secretary 
which of  several  different  possible  methods  the  Department 
must  use.  Nor  does  it  rule  out  the  present  formula,  which 
distributes  districts  in  accordance  with  per-pupil  expendi-
tures, while essentially weighting each district to reflect the 
number of pupils it contains. 

Because the statute uses technical language (e. g., "percen-
tile")  and  seeks  a  technical  purpose  (eliminating  unchar-
acteristic,  or  outlier,  districts),  we  have  examined  diction-
ary  definitions  of  the  term  "percentile."  See  41  Fed.  Reg. 
26320 (Congress  intended measurements based upon an "ac-
cepted principle of statistical evaluation" (emphasis added)).

Opinion of the Court 
Those definitions make clear that "percentile" refers to a di-vision  of  a  distribution  of 

some  population  into  100  parts. 
Thus,  Webster's  Third  New  International  Dictionary  1675 (1961) (Webster's Third) defines "percentile" as "the value of 

the statistical variable that marks the boundary between any two  consecutive  intervals  in  a  distribution  of  100  intervals 
each  containing  one  percent  of  the  total  population."  A 
standard  economics  dictionary  gives  a  similar  definition  for "percentiles": 

"The  values  separating  hundredth  parts  of  a  distribu-
tion,  arranged  in  order  of  size.  The  99th  percentile  of the income distribution, for example, is the income level 

such that only one per cent of the population have larger 
incomes."  J. Black, A Dictionary of Economics 348-349 (2d ed. 2002). 

A  dictionary  of  mathematics  states:  "The  n-th  percentile  is 
the  value  Xn/100  such  that  n  per  cent  of  the  population  is less  than  or  equal  to 

Xn/100."  It  adds  that  "[t]he  terms  can 
be modified,  though not  always  very  satisfactorily, to  be  ap-plicable  to  a  discrete  random  variable  or  to  a  large  sample 

ranked in ascending order."  C. Clapham & J. Nicholson, The 
Concise  Oxford  Dictionary  of  Mathematics  378-379  (3d  ed. 2005)  (emphasis  deleted).  The  American  Heritage  Science 

Dictionary  468  (2005)  explains  that  a  percentile  is  "[a]ny  of the  100  equal  parts  into  which  the  range  of  the  values  of  a 
set  of  data  can  be  divided  in  order  to  show  the  distribution of  those  values."  And  Merriam-Webster's  Medical  Desk 
Dictionary  612  (2002)  describes  percentile  as  "a  value  on  a scale of one hundred that indicates the percent of a distribu-
tion that is equal to or below it." 

These  definitions,  mainstream  and  technical,  all  indicate 
that,  in  order  to  identify  the  relevant  percentile  cutoffs,  the 
Secretary must construct a distribution of values.  That dis-
tribution will consist of a "population" ranked according to a 
characteristic.  That  characteristic  takes  on  a  "value"  for

Opinion of the Court 

each  member  of  the  relevant  population.  The  statute's  in-struction to identify the 95th and 5th "percentile of such ex-

penditures"  makes  clear  that  the  relevant  characteristic  for ranking  purposes  is  per-pupil  expenditure  during  a  particu-
lar  year.  But  the  statute  does  not  specify  precisely  what 
population  is  to  be  "distributed"  (i. e.,  ranked  according  to 
the  population's  corresponding  values  for  the  relevant  char-
acteristic).  Nor  does  it  set  forth  various  details  as  to  how precisely  the  distribution  is  to  be  constructed  (as  long  as  it 

is ranked according to the specified characteristic). But  why  is  Congress'  silence  in  respect  to  these  matters 
significant?  Are  there  several  different  populations,  rele-
vant  here,  that  one  might  rank  according  to  "per-pupil  ex-
penditures"  (and  thereby  determine  in  several  different 
ways a cutoff point such that "n percent of [that] population" 
falls,  say, below  the  percentile  cutoff)?  We  are  not  experts 
in  statistics,  but  a  statistician  is  not  needed  to  see  what  the 
dictionary  does  not  say.  No  dictionary  definition  we  have 
found suggests that there is any single logical, mathematical, 
or statistical link between, on the one hand, the characteriz-
ing data (used for ranking purposes) and, on the other hand, 
the nature of the relevant population or how that population 
might  be  weighted  for  purposes  of  determining  a  percentile 
cutoff. 

Here, the Secretary has distributed districts, ranked them 
according to per-pupil expenditure, but compared only those 
that  account  for  90  percent  of  the  State's  pupils.  Thus,  the 
Secretary  has  used--as  her  predecessors  had  done  for  a 
quarter century before her--the State's students as the rele-
vant  population  for  calculating  the  specified  percentiles. 
Another  Secretary  might  have  distributed  districts,  ranked 
them by per-pupil expenditure, and made no reference to the 
number  of  pupils  (a  method  that  satisfies  the  statute's  lan-
guage  but  threatens  the  problems  the  Secretary  long  ago 
identified, see 41 Fed. Reg. 26324; supra, at 91-93).  A third 
Secretary  might  have  distributed  districts,  ranked  them  by

Opinion of the Court 
per-pupil expenditure, but compared only those that account for  90  percent  of  total  pupil  expenditures  in  the  State.  A 

fourth  Secretary  might  have  distributed  districts,  ranked them  by  per-pupil  expenditure,  but  calculated  the  95th  and 
5th percentile cutoffs using the per-pupil expenditures of all the individual 

schools in the State.  See 41 Fed. Reg. 26324 
(considering  this  system  of  calculation).  A  fifth  Secretary 
might  have  distributed  districts,  ranked  them  by  per-pupil expenditure,  but  accounted  in  his  disparity  calculation  for 

the  sometimes  significant  differences  in  per-pupil  spending at different grade  levels.  See 34 CFR $ 222.162(b)(1)  (2006) 
(authorizing such a system); id., pt. 222, subpt. K, App.  See 
also Appendix B, infra. 

Each of these methods amounts to a different way of deter-
mining which districts fall between the 5th and 95th "percen-
tile  of per-pupil expenditures."  For  purposes  of  that calcu-
lation,  they  each  adopt  different  populations--students, 
districts, schools, and grade levels.  Yet, linguistically 
speaking,  one  may  attribute  the  characteristic  of  per-pupil 
expenditure to each member of any such population (though 
the values of that characteristic may be more or less readily 
available  depending  on  the  chosen  population,  see  41  Fed. 
Reg.  26324).  Hence,  the  statute's  literal  language  covers 
any  or  all  of  these  methods.  That  language  alone  does  not 
tell  us  (or  the  Secretary  of  Education),  however,  which 
method to use.

98  ZUNI  PUBLIC  SCHOOL  DIST.  NO.  89  v.  DEPARTMENT 

OF  EDUCATION 

Opinion of the Court 

instructed  to  look  at  a  district's  "per-pupil  expenditures." 
The  remainder  of  the  dissent's  argument,  colorful  language 
to  the  side,  rests  upon  a  reading  of  the  statutory  language 
that ignores its basic purpose and history. 

We  find  additional  evidence  for  our  understanding  of  the 
language  in  the  fact  that  Congress,  in  other  statutes,  has 
clarified the matter here at issue thereby avoiding compara-
ble ambiguity.  For example, in a different education-related 
statute, Congress refers to "the school at the 20th percentile 
in the  State, based on  enrollment, among all schools ranked 
by  the  percentage  of  students  at  the  proficient  level." 20  
U. S. C.  $ 6311(b)(2)(E)(ii)  (2000  ed.,  Supp.  IV)  (emphasis 
added).  In  another  statute  fixing  charges  for  physicians 
services, Congress specified that the maximum charge "shall 
be the 50th percentile of the customary charges for the serv-
ice  (weighted  by  the  frequency  of  the  service)  performed  by 
nonparticipating physicians  in  the locality  during the  [prior] 
12-month  period."  42  U. S. C.  $ 1395u( j)(1)(C)(v)  (2000  ed.) 
(emphasis  added).  In  these  statutes  Congress  indicated 
with  greater  specificity  how  a  percentile  should  be  deter-
mined by stating precisely not only which data values are of 
interest,  but  also  (in  the  first)  the  population  that  is  to  be 
distributed  and  (in  the  second)  the  weightings  needed  to 
make the calculation meaningful and to avoid counterproduc-
tive results.  In the statute at issue here, however, Congress 
used  more  general  language  (drafted  by  the  Secretary  him-
self),  which  leaves  the  Secretary  with  the  authority  to  re-
solve such subsidiary matters at the administrative level. 

We  also  find  support  for  our  view  of  the  language  in  the 
more  general  circumstance  that  statutory  "[a]mbiguity  is  a 
creature  not  [ just]  of  definitional  possibilities  but  [also]  of 
statutory  context."  Brown  v.  Gardner,  513  U. S.  115,  118 
(1994).  See  also  FDA  v.  Brown  &  Williamson  Tobacco 
Corp.,  529 U. S. 120, 132-133 (2000) ("[m]eaning--or ambigu-
ity--of  certain  words  or  phrases  may  only  become  evident

Opinion of the Court 
when placed in context" (emphasis added)).  That may be so 
even if statutory language is highly technical.  After all, the 
scope  of  what  seems  a  precise  technical  chess  instruction, 
such as  "you must place  the  queen  next  to the  king," varies 
with  context,  depending,  for  example,  upon  whether  the  in-
structor  is  telling  a  beginner  how  to  set  up  the  board  or 
telling  an  advanced  player  how  to  checkmate  an  opponent. 
The dictionary acknowledges that, when interpreting techni-
cal statistical language, the purpose of the exercise matters, 
for it says that "quantile," "percentile," "quartile," and "dec-
ile"  are  "terms  [that]  can  be  modified,  though  not  always 
very  satisfactorily,  to  be  applicable  to . . .  a  large  sample 
ranked  in  ascending  order."  Oxford  Dictionary  of  Mathe-
matics, at 378-379. 

Thus,  an  instruction  to  "identify  schools  with  average 
scholastic  aptitude  test  scores  below  the  5th  percentile  of 
such scores" may vary as to the population to be distributed, 
depending upon whether the context is one of providing addi-
tional counseling and support  to students at low-performing 
schools  (in  which  case  the  relevant  population  would  likely 
consist of students), or one of identifying unsuccessful learn-
ing  protocols  at  low-performing  schools  (in  which  case  the 
appropriate population may well be the schools themselves). 
Context  here  tells  us  that  the  instruction  to  identify  school 
districts  with  "per-pupil  expenditures"  above  the  95th  per-
centile  "of  such  expenditures"  is  similarly  ambiguous,  be-
cause both students and school districts are of concern to the 
statute.  Accordingly,  the  disregard  instruction  can  include 
within  its scope the  distribution of a ranked population that 
consists  of  pupils  (or  of  school  districts  weighted  by  pupils) 
and  not  just  a  ranked  distribution  of  unweighted  school  dis-
tricts alone. 

Finally,  we  draw  reassurance  from  the  fact  that  no  group 
of  statisticians,  nor  any  individual  statistician,  has  told  us 
directly in briefs, or indirectly through citation, that the lan-

guage  before  us  cannot  be  read  as  we  have  read  it.  This circumstance  is  significant,  for  the  statutory  language  is 

technical,  and  we  are  not  statisticians.  And  the  views  of experts (or their absence) might help us understand (though 
not  control  our  determination  of)  what  Congress  had  in mind. 

The  upshot  is  that  the  language  of  the  statute  is  broad enough  to  permit  the  Secretary's  reading.  That  fact  re-
quires us to look beyond the language to determine whether the Secretary's interpretation is a reasonable, hence permis-
sible,  implementation  of  the  statute.  See  Chevron,  467 U. S.,  at  842-843.  For  the  reasons  set  forth  in  Part  II-A, 
supra, we  conclude that  the Secretary's reading is a reason-able reading.  We consequently find the Secretary's  method 
of calculation lawful. The judgment of the Tenth Circuit is affirmed. 

It is so ordered. 
APPENDIXES TO OPINION OF THE COURT

We set out the relevant statutory provisions and accompa-nying  regulations  in  full.  The  reader  will  note  that  in  the 

text  of  our  opinion,  for  purposes  of  exposition,  we  use  the term  "local  school  districts"  where  the  statute  refers  to 
"local  educational  agencies."  We  also  disregard  the  stat-ute's  frequent  references  to  local  "revenues"  because  those 
references  do  not  raise  any  additional  considerations  ger- mane to this case.

"partial-birth abortion," $ 1531(b)(1), as a procedure in which the doctor: 
"(A) deliberately and intentionally vaginally delivers a living fetus until, 
in  the case  of a  head-first  presentation,  the entire  fetal  head  is outside 
the [mother's] body . . . , or,  in  the  case of breech presentation, any part 
of the fetal trunk past the navel is outside the [mother's] body . . . , for  
the purpose of performing an  overt act  that the person knows will kill 
the  partially  delivered  living  fetus";  and  "(B)  performs  the  overt  act, 
other than completion of delivery, that kills the fetus." 

In No. 05-380, respondent abortion doctors challenged the Act's con-
stitutionality on its face, and the Federal District Court granted a per-
manent injunction prohibiting petitioner Attorney General from enforc-
ing  the  Act  in  all  cases  but  those  in  which  there  was  no  dispute  the 
fetus  was  viable.  The  court  found  the  Act  unconstitutional  because  it 
(1) lacked an exception allowing the prohibited procedure where neces-
sary for the mother's health and (2) covered not merely intact D&E but 
also  other  D&Es.  Affirming,  the  Eighth  Circuit  found  that  a  lack  of 
consensus  existed  in  the  medical  community  as  to  the  banned  proce-
dure's  necessity,  and  thus  Stenberg  required  legislatures  to  err  on  the 
side  of  protecting  women's  health  by  including  a  health  exception.  In 
No.  05-1382,  respondent  abortion  advocacy  groups  brought  suit  chal-
lenging  the  Act.  The  District  Court  enjoined  the  Attorney  General 
from  enforcing  the  Act,  concluding  it  was  unconstitutional  on  its  face 
because  it  (1)  unduly  burdened  a  woman's  ability  to  choose  a  second-
trimester abortion, (2) was too vague, and (3) lacked a health exception 
as required by Stenberg.  The Ninth Circuit agreed and affirmed. 

Held:  Respondents have not demonstrated that the Act, as a facial matter, 

is void for vagueness, or that it imposes an undue burden on a woman's 
right  to  abortion  based  on  its  overbreadth  or  lack  of  a  health  excep-
tion.  Pp. 145-168. 

1.  The  Casey  Court  reaffirmed  what  it  termed  Roe's  three-part  "es-
sential holding": First, a woman has the right to choose to have an abor-
tion  before  fetal  viability  and  to  obtain  it  without  undue  interference 
from  the State.  Second,  the State  has the power to  restrict  abortions 
after viability, if the law contains exceptions for pregnancies endanger-
ing  the  woman's  life  or  health.  And  third,  the  State  has  legitimate 
interests  from  the  pregnancy's  outset  in  protecting  the  health  of  the 
woman and the life of the fetus that may become a child.  505 U. S., at 
846.  Though all three are implicated here, it is the third that requires 
the  most  extended  discussion.  In  deciding  whether  the  Act  furthers 
the Government's  legitimate  interest  in protecting fetal  life, the  Court 
assumes,  inter  alia,  that  an undue  burden  on  the  previability  abortion

right exists  if a regulation's "purpose  or effect is to place a substantial 
obstacle in the [woman's] path," id., at 878, but that "[r]egulations which 
do no more than create a structural mechanism by which the State . . .  
may express profound respect for the life of the unborn are permitted, 
if  they  are  not  a  substantial  obstacle  to  the  woman's  exercise  of  the 
right  to  choose,"  id.,  at  877.  Casey  struck  a  balance  that  was  central 
to its holding, and the Court applies Casey's standard  here.  A central 
premise of Casey's joint opinion--that the government has a legitimate, 
substantial  interest  in  preserving  and  promoting  fetal  life--would 
be  repudiated  were  the  Court  now  to  affirm  the  judgments  below. 
Pp. 145-146. 

2.  The Act, on its face, is not void for vagueness and does not impose 
an undue burden from any overbreadth.  Pp. 146-156. 

(a)  The  Act's  text  demonstrates  that  it  regulates  and  proscribes 
performing  the  intact  D&E  procedure.  First,  since  the  doctor  must 
"vaginally delive[r] a living  fetus," $ 1531(b)(1)(A), the  Act does  not re-
strict  abortions  involving  delivery  of  an  expired  fetus  or  those  not 
involving  vaginal  delivery,  e. g.,  hysterotomy  or  hysterectomy.  And 
it applies both previability and postviability because, by common under-
standing  and  scientific  terminology,  a  fetus  is  a  living  organism  within 
the  womb,  whether  or  not  it  is  viable  outside  the  womb.  Second,  be-
cause the Act requires the living fetus to be delivered to a specific ana-
tomical  landmark  depending  on  the  fetus'  presentation,  ibid.,  an  abor-
tion  not  involving  such  partial  delivery  is  permitted.  Third,  because 
the doctor must  perform  an  "overt act, other  than completion of  deliv-
ery,  that  kills  the  partially  delivered  fetus,"  $ 1531(b)(1)(B),  the  "overt 
act" must be separate from delivery.  It must also occur after delivery 
to an anatomical landmark, since killing "the partially delivered" fetus, 
when read in context, refers to a fetus that has been so delivered, ibid. 
Fourth, given the Act's scienter requirements, delivery of a living fetus 
past an anatomical landmark by accident or inadvertence is not a crime 
because it is not "deliberat[e] and intentiona[l]," $ 1531(b)(1)(A).  Nor is 
such  a  delivery  prohibited  if  the  fetus  has  not  been  delivered  "for  the 
purpose of performing an overt act that the [doctor] knows will kill [it]." 
Ibid.  Pp. 146-148. 

(b)  The Act is not unconstitutionally vague on its face.  It satisfies 
both  requirements  of  the  void-for-vagueness  doctrine.  First,  it  pro-
vides doctors "of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know 
what  is  prohibited,"  Grayned  v.  City  of  Rockford,  408  U. S.  104,  108, 
setting  forth  "relatively  clear  guidelines  as  to  prohibited  conduct"  and 
providing  "objective  criteria"  to  evaluate  whether  a  doctor  has  per-
formed a prohibited procedure, Posters `N' Things, Ltd. v. United States,

511 U. S. 513, 525-526.  Second, it does not encourage arbitrary or dis-
criminatory enforcement.  Kolender v.  Lawson, 461 U. S. 352, 357.  Its 
anatomical  landmarks  "establish  minimal  guidelines  to  govern  law  en-
forcement," Smith v. Goguen, 415 U. S. 566, 574, and its scienter require-
ments narrow the scope of its prohibition and limit prosecutorial discre-
tion, see Kolender, supra, at 358.  Respondents' arbitrary enforcement 
arguments,  furthermore,  are somewhat  speculative,  since this is  a pre-
enforcement challenge.  Pp. 148-150. 

(c)  The Court rejects respondents' argument that the Act imposes 
an undue burden, as a facial matter, because its restrictions on second-
trimester abortions are too broad.  Pp. 150-156. 

(i)  The Act's text discloses that it prohibits a doctor from inten-
tionally  performing  an  intact  D&E.  Its  dual  prohibitions  correspond 
with  the  steps  generally  undertaken  in  this  procedure:  The  doctor 
(1) delivers the fetus until its head lodges in the cervix, usually past the 
anatomical landmark  for a breech presentation,  see $ 1531(b)(1)(A), and 
(2) proceeds to the overt act of piercing or crushing the fetal skull after 
the  partial  delivery,  see  $ 1531(b)(1)(B).  The  Act's  scienter  require-
ments limit its reach to those physicians who carry out the intact D&E, 
with the intent to undertake both steps at the outset.  The Act excludes 
most  D&Es  in  which  the  doctor  intends  to  remove  the  fetus  in  pieces 
from the outset.  This interpretation is confirmed by comparing the Act 
with  the  Nebraska  statute  in  Stenberg.  There,  the  Court  concluded 
that the statute  encompassed D&E, which "often involve[s] a physician 
pulling a `substantial portion'  of a  still living fetus  . . . , say, an arm or 
leg,  into  the  vagina  prior  to  the  death  of  the  fetus,"  530  U. S.,  at  939, 
and  rejected  the  Nebraska  Attorney  General's  limiting  interpretation 
that  the  statute's  reference  to  a  "procedure"  that  " `kill[s]  the  unborn 
child' "  was  to  a  distinct  procedure,  not  to  the  abortion  procedure  as  a 
whole, id., at 943.  It is apparent Congress responded to these concerns 
because the  Act  adopts  the phrase  "delivers  a  living fetus,"  18 U. S. C. 

$ 1531(b)(1)(A),  instead  of  " `delivering  .  .  .  a  living  unborn  child,  or  a 
substantial portion thereof,' " 530 U. S., at 938, thereby targeting extrac-
tion  of  an  entire  fetus  rather  than  removal  of  fetal  pieces;  identifies 
specific anatomical landmarks to which the fetus must be partially deliv-
ered,  $ 1531(b)(1)(A),  thereby  clarifying  that  the  removal  of  a  small 
portion of the fetus is not prohibited; requires the fetus to be delivered 
so that it is partially "outside the [mother's] body," ibid., thereby estab-
lishing that delivering a substantial portion of the fetus into the vagina 
would  not  subject  a  doctor  to  criminal  sanctions;  and  adds  the  overt-
act  requirement,  $ 1531(b)(1),  thereby  making  the  distinction  the  Ne-
braska  statute  failed  to  draw  (but  the  Nebraska  Attorney  General

advanced).  Finally, the canon of constitutional avoidance, see, e. g., Ed-
ward  J.  DeBartolo  Corp.  v.  Florida  Gulf  Coast  Building  &  Constr. 
Trades  Council,  485  U. S.  568,  575,  extinguishes  any  lingering  doubt. 
Interpreting the Act not to prohibit standard D&E is the most reason-
able reading and understanding of its terms.  Pp. 150-154. 

(ii)  Respondents'  contrary  arguments  are  unavailing.  The  con-
tention that any D&E may result in the delivery of a living fetus beyond 
the  Act's  anatomical  landmarks  because  doctors  cannot  predict  the 
amount the cervix will dilate before the procedure does not take account 
of the Act's intent requirements, which preclude liability for an acciden-
tal  intact  D&E.  The  evidence  supports  the  legislative  determination 
that  an  intact delivery  is  almost  always  a conscious  choice  rather  than 
a happenstance, belying any claim that a standard D&E cannot be per-
formed  without  intending  or  foreseeing  an  intact  D&E.  That  many 
doctors  begin  every  D&E  with  the  objective  of  removing  the  fetus  as 
intact as possible based on their belief that this is safer does not prove, 
as respondents suggest, that every D&E might violate the Act, thereby 
imposing  an  undue  burden.  It  demonstrates  only  that  those  doctors 
must  adjust  their  conduct  to  the  law  by  not  attempting  to  deliver  the 
fetus  to  an  anatomical  landmark.  Respondents  have  not  shown  that 
requiring doctors to intend dismemberment before such a delivery will 
prohibit the vast majority of D&E abortions.  Pp. 154-156. 

3.  The Act, measured by its text in this facial attack, does not impose 
a "substantial obstacle" to late-term, but previability, abortions, as pro-
hibited by the Casey plurality, 505 U. S., at 878.  Pp. 156-167. 

(a)  The contention that the Act's congressional purpose was to cre-
ate  such  an  obstacle  is  rejected.  The  Act's  stated  purposes  are  pro-
tecting  innocent  human  life  from  a  brutal  and  inhumane  procedure 
and  protecting  the  medical  community's  ethics  and  reputation.  The 
government  undoubtedly  "has  an  interest  in  protecting  the  integrity 
and  ethics  of  the  medical  profession."  Washington  v.  Glucksberg,  521 
U. S.  702,  731.  Moreover,  Casey  reaffirmed  that  the  government  may 
use  its  voice  and  its  regulatory  authority  to  show  its  profound  respect 
for  the  life  within  the  woman.  See,  e. g.,  505  U. S.,  at  873.  The  Act's 
ban on abortions involving partial delivery of a living fetus furthers the 
Government's objectives.  Congress determined that such abortions are 
similar  to  the  killing  of  a  newborn  infant.  This  Court  has  confirmed 
the validity of drawing boundaries to prevent practices that extinguish 
life and are close to actions that are condemned.  Glucksberg, supra, at 
732-735, and n. 23.  The Act also recognizes that respect for human life 
finds an ultimate expression in a mother's love for her child.  Whether 
to have an abortion requires a difficult and painful moral decision, Casey,

Syllabus 
505 U. S., at 852-853, which some women come to regret.  In a decision 
so fraught with emotional consequence, some doctors may prefer not to 
disclose precise details of the abortion procedure to be used.  It is, how-
ever,  precisely  this  lack  of  information  that  is  of  legitimate  concern  to 
the  State.  Id.,  at  873.  The  State's  interest  in  respect  for  life  is  ad-
vanced  by  the  dialogue  that  better  informs  the  political  and  legal  sys-
tems, the medical profession, expectant mothers, and society as a whole 
of the consequences that follow from a decision to elect a late-term abor-
tion.  The objection that the Act accomplishes little because the stand-
ard D&E is in some respects as brutal, if not more, than intact D&E is 
unpersuasive.  It  was  reasonable  for  Congress  to  think  that  partial-
birth  abortion,  more than  standard  D&E,  undermines the  public's  per-
ception  of  the  doctor's  appropriate  role  during  delivery,  and  perverts 
the birth process.  Pp. 156-160. 

(b)  The  Act's  failure  to  allow  the  banned  procedure's  use  where 
" `necessary,  in  appropriate  medical  judgment,  for  the  preservation  of 
the [mother's] health,' " Ayotte v.  Planned Parenthood of Northern New 
Eng.,  546  U. S.  320,  327-328,  does  not  have  the  effect  of  imposing  an 
unconstitutional burden on the abortion right.  The Court assumes the 
Act's  prohibition  would  be  unconstitutional,  under  controlling  prece-
dents, if it "subject[ed] [women] to significant health risks."  Id., at 328. 
Whether  the  Act  creates  such  risks  was,  however,  a  contested  factual 
question  below:  The  evidence  presented  in  the  trial  courts  and  before 
Congress  demonstrates  both sides  have  medical  support  for  their  posi-
tions.  The  Court's  precedents  instruct  that the  Act  can  survive  facial 
attack  when  this  medical  uncertainty  persists.  See,  e. g.,  Kansas  v. 
Hendricks,  521  U. S.  346,  360,  n.  3.  This  traditional  rule  is  consistent 
with  Casey,  which  confirms  both  that  the  State  has  an  interest  in  pro-
moting  respect  for  human  life  at  all  stages  in  the  pregnancy,  and  that 
abortion doctors should be treated the same as other doctors.  Medical 
uncertainty  does  not  foreclose  the  exercise  of  legislative  power  in  the 
abortion context any more than it does in other contexts.  Other consid-
erations also support the Court's conclusion, including the fact that safe 
alternatives  to  the  prohibited  procedure,  such  as  D&E,  are  available. 
In  addition,  if  intact  D&E  is  truly  necessary  in  some  circumstances,  a 
prior injection to kill the fetus allows a doctor to perform the procedure, 
given that the Act's prohibition only applies to the delivery of "a living 
fetus," 18 U. S. C. $ 1531(b)(1)(A).  Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. 
v.  Danforth, 428 U. S. 52, 77-79, distinguished.  The Court rejects cer-
tain of the parties' arguments.  On the one hand, the Attorney Gener-
al's contention that the Act should be upheld based on the congressional 
findings  alone  fails  because  some  of  the  Act's  recitations  are  factually

Syllabus 
incorrect,  and  some  of  the  important  findings  have  been  superseded. 
Also  unavailing,  however,  is  respondents'  contention  that  an  abortion 
regulation  must  contain  a  health  exception  if  "substantial  medical  au-
thority  supports  the  proposition  that  banning  a  particular  procedure 
could endanger women's health," Stenberg, 530 U. S., at 938.  Interpret-
ing  Stenberg  as  leaving  no  margin  for  legislative  error  in  the  face  of 
medical uncertainty is too exacting a standard.  Marginal safety consid-
erations, including the balance of risks, are within the legislative compe-
tence  where,  as  here,  the  regulation  is  rational  and  pursues  legitimate 
ends, and standard, safe medical options are available.  Pp. 161-167. 

4.  These  facial  attacks  should  not  have  been  entertained  in  the  first 
instance.  In  these circumstances the proper  means to  consider excep-
tions  is  by  as-applied  challenge.  Cf.  Wisconsin  Right  to  Life,  Inc.  v. 
Federal Election Comm'n, 546 U. S. 410, 412.  This is the proper man-
ner to protect the woman's health if it can be shown that in discrete and 
well-defined instances  a condition has or  is likely  to occur  in which the 
procedure prohibited by the Act must be used.  No as-applied challenge 
need  be  brought  if  the  Act's  prohibition  threatens  a  woman's  life,  be-
cause  the  Act  already  contains  a  life  exception.  18  U. S. C.  $ 1531(a).

134  GONZALES  v.  CARHART 

Opinion of the Court 

I 
A 
The Act proscribes a particular manner of ending fetal life, so it is necessary here, as it was in Stenberg, to discuss abor-

tion  procedures  in  some  detail.  Three  United  States  Dis-trict  Courts  heard  extensive  evidence  describing  the  proce-
dures.  In addition to the two courts involved in the instant cases  the  District  Court  for  the  Southern  District  of  New 
York  also  considered  the  constitutionality  of  the  Act.  Na-tional Abortion Federation v.  Ashcroft,  330 F.  Supp. 2d  436 
(2004).  It found the Act unconstitutional, id., at 493, and the Court  of  Appeals  for  the  Second  Circuit  affirmed,  National 
Abortion Federation v.  Gonzales, 437 F. 3d 278 (2006).  The three  District  Courts  relied  on  similar  medical  evidence;  in-
deed,  much  of  the  evidence  submitted  to  the  Carhart  court previously had been submitted to the other two courts.  331 
F.  Supp.  2d,  at  809-810.  We  refer  to  the  District  Courts' exhaustive  opinions  in  our  own  discussi on  of  abortion 
procedures. Abortion  methods  vary  depending  to  some  extent  on  the 
preferences  of  the  physician  and,  of  course,  on  the  term  of the  pregnancy  and  the  resulting  stage  of  the  unborn  child's 
development.  Between  85  and  90  percent  of  the  approx-imately  1.3  million  abortions  performed  each  year  in  the 
United  States  take  place  in  the  first  three  months  of  preg-nancy,  which  is  to  say  in  the  first  trimester.  Planned  Par-
enthood,  supra,  at  960,  and  n.  4;  App.  in  No.  05-1382, pp.  45- 48.  The most common first-trimester abortion 
method  is  vacuum  aspiration  (otherwise  known  as  suction curettage) in which the physician vacuums out the embryonic 
tissue.  Early in this trimester an alternative is to use medi-cation,  such  as  mifepristone  (commonly  known  as  RU-486), 
to  terminate  the  pregnancy.  National  Abortion  Federa-tion,  supra,  at  464,  n.  20.  The  Act  does  not  regulate  these 
procedures.

Opinion of the Court 
Of the remaining abortions that take place each year, most 
occur  in  the  second  trimester.  The  surgical  procedure  re-
ferred to as "dilation and evacuation" or "D&E" is the usual 
abortion  method  in  this  trimester.  Planned  Parenthood, 
supra,  at  960-961.  Although  individual  techniques  for  per-
forming D&E differ, the general steps are the same. 

A doctor must first dilate the cervix at least to the extent 
needed to insert surgical instruments into the uterus and to 
maneuver  them  to  evacuate  the  fetus.  National  Abortion 
Federation,  supra,  at  465;  App.  in  No.  05-1382,  at  61.  The 
steps  taken  to  cause  dilation  differ  by  physician  and  gesta-
tional  age  of  the  fetus.  See,  e. g.,  Carhart,  supra,  at  852, 
856,  859,  862-865,  868,  870,  873-874,  876-877,  880,  883,  886. 
A  doctor  often  begins  the  dilation  process  by  inserting  os-
motic dilators, such as laminaria (sticks of seaweed), into the 
cervix.  The dilators can be used in combination with drugs, 
such  as  misoprostol,  that  increase  dilation.  The  resulting 
amount of dilation is not uniform, and a doctor does not know 
in  advance  how  an  individual  patient  will  respond.  In  gen-
eral  the  longer  dilators  remain  in  the  cervix,  the  more  it 
will  dilate.  Yet  the  length  of  time  doctors  employ  osmotic 
dilators  varies.  Some  may  keep  dilators  in  the  cervix  for 
two  days,  while  others  use  dilators  for  a  day  or  less.  Na-
tional  Abortion  Federation,  supra,  at  464-465;  Planned 
Parenthood, supra, at 961. 

After  sufficient  dilation  the  surgical  operation  can  com-
mence.  The  woman  is  placed  under  general  anesthesia  or 
conscious sedation.  The doctor, often guided by ultrasound, 
inserts grasping forceps through the woman's cervix and into 
the  uterus  to  grab  the  fetus.  The  doctor  grips  a  fetal  part 
with  the  forceps  and  pulls  it  back  through  the  cervix  and 
vagina, continuing to pull even after meeting resistance from 
the cervix.  The friction causes the fetus to tear apart.  For 
example,  a  leg  might  be  ripped  off  the  fetus  as  it  is  pulled 
through  the  cervix  and  out  of  the  woman.  The  process  of

Opinion of the Court 
evacuating  the  fetus  piece  by  piece  continues  until  it  has been  completely  removed.  A  doctor  may  make  10  to  15 

passes with  the  forceps to  evacuate  the  fetus in  its entirety, though  sometimes  removal  is  completed  with  fewer  passes. 
Once the fetus has been evacuated, the placenta and any re-maining  fetal  material  are  suctioned  or  scraped  out  of  the 
uterus.  The  doctor  examines  the  different  parts  to  ensure 
the entire fetal body has been removed.  See, e. g., National 
Abortion  Federation,  supra,  at  465;  Planned  Parenthood, 
320 F. Supp. 2d, at 962. Some doctors, especially later in the second trimester, may 

kill  the  fetus  a  day  or  two  before  performing  the  surgical 
evacuation.  They  inject  digoxin  or  potassium  chloride  into 
the  fetus,  the  umbilical  cord,  or  the  amniotic  fluid.  Fetal 
demise  may  cause  contractions  and  make  greater  dilation 
possible.  Once  dead,  moreover,  the  fetus'  body  will  soften, 
and  its  removal  will  be  easier.  Other  doctors  refrain  from 
injecting chemical agents, believing it adds risk with little or 
no  medical  benefit.  Carhart,  supra,  at  907-912;  National 
Abortion Federation, supra, at 474-475. 

The  abortion  procedure  that  was  the  impetus  for  the  nu-
merous  bans  on  "partial-birth  abortion,"  including  the  Act, 
is  a  variation  of  this  standard  D&E.  See  M.  Haskell,  Dila-
tion  and  Extraction  for  Late  Second  Trimester  Abortion 
(1992), 1 Appellant's App. in No. 04-3379 (CA8), p. 109 (here-
inafter  Dilation  and  Extraction).  The  medical  community 
has  not  reached  unanimity  on  the  appropriate  name  for  this 
D&E  variation.  It  has  been  referred  to  as  "intact  D&E," 
"dilation  and  extraction"  (D&X),  and  "intact  D&X."  Na-
tional  Abortion  Federation,  supra,  at  440,  n.  2;  see  also  F. 
Cunningham  et  al.,  Williams  Obstetrics  243  (22d  ed.  2005)

Opinion of the Court 
Abortion  136  (1999)  (identifying  the  procedure  as  intact D&E).  For  discussion  purposes  this D&E  variation will  be 

referred  to  as  intact  D&E.  The  main  difference  between the  two  procedures  is  that  in  intact  D&E  a  doctor  extracts 
the  fetus  intact  or  largely  intact  with  only  a  few  passes. There  are  no  comprehensive  statistics  indicating  what  per-
centage of all D&Es are performed in this manner. 

Intact D&E, like regular D&E, begins with dilation of the cervix.  Sufficient  dilation  is  essential  for  the  procedure. 

To achieve intact extraction some doctors thus may attempt to dilate the cervix to a greater  degree.  This approach has 
been  called  "serial"  dilation.  Carhart,  331  F.  Supp.  2d,  at 856,  870,  873; 

Planned  Parenthood,  supra,  at  965.  Doctors 
who attempt at the outset to perform intact D&E may dilate for two full days or use up to 25 osmotic dilators.  See, 

e. g., 
Dilation  and  Extraction  110;  Carhart,  supra,  at  865,  868, 876, 886. 

In an  intact  D&E procedure  the doctor  extracts the  fetus in  a  way  conducive  to  pulling  out  its  entire  body,  instead  of 
ripping it apart.  One doctor, for example, testified: 

"If I know I have good dilation and I reach in and the 
fetus starts to come out and I think I can accomplish it, the  abortion  with  an  intact  delivery,  then  I  use  my  for-

ceps  a  little  bit  differently.  I  don't  close  them  quite  so 
much,  and  I  just  gently  draw  the  tissue  out  attempt-ing  to  have  an  intact  delivery,  if  possible."  App.  in 

No. 05-1382, at 74. 
Rotating  the  fetus  as  it  is  being  pulled  decreases  the  odds of  dismemberment. 

Carhart,  supra,  at  868-869;  App.  in 
No.  05-380,  pp.  40-41;  5  Appellant's  App.  in  No.  04-3379 
(CA8),  at  1469.  A  doctor  also  "may  use  forceps  to  grasp  a 
fetal  part,  pull  it  down,  and  re-grasp  the  fetus  at  a  higher 
level--sometimes  using  both  his  hand  and  a  forceps--to 
exert  traction  to  retrieve  the  fetus  intact  until  the  head  is 
lodged in the [cervix]."  Carhart, supra, at 886-887.

138  GONZALES  v.  CARHART 

Opinion of the Court 
Intact  D&E  gained  public  notoriety  when,  in  1992, Dr.  Martin  Haskell  gave  a  presentation  describing  his 

method  of  performing  the  operation.  Dilation  and  Extrac-tion  110-111.  In  the  usual  intact  D&E  the  fetus'  head 
lodges in the cervix, and dilation is insufficient to allow it to pass.  See,  e. g.,  ibid.;  App.  in  No.  05-380,  at  577;  App.  in 
No. 05-1382,  at 74,  282.  Haskell explained  the  next  step as follows: 

" `At  this  point,  the  right-handed  surgeon  slides  the  fin-gers  of  the  left  [hand]  along  the  back  of  the  fetus  and 
"hooks"  the  shoulders  of  the  fetus  with  the  index  and ring fingers (palm down). 
" `While  maintaining  this  tension,  lifting  the  cervix  and applying  traction  to  the  shoulders  with  the  fingers  of 
the  left  hand,  the  surgeon  takes  a  pair  of  blunt  curved Metzenbaum  scissors  in  the  right  hand.  He  carefully 
advances  the  tip,  curved  down,  along  the  spine  and under his middle finger until he feels it contact the base 
of the skull under the tip of his middle finger. 
" `[T]he surgeon then forces the scissors into the base of the  skull  or  into  the  foramen  magnum.  Having  safely 

entered  the  skull,  he  spreads  the  scissors  to  enlarge the opening. 
" `The  surgeon  removes  the  scissors  and  introduces  a suction  catheter  into  this  hole  and  evacuates  the  skull 
contents.  With  the  catheter  still  in  place,  he  applies traction  to  the  fetus,  removing  it  completely  from  the 
patient.' "  H. R. Rep. No. 108-58, p. 3 (2003). 
This  is  an  abortion  doctor's  clinical  description.  Here  is another  description  from  a  nurse  who  witnessed  the  same 

method  performed  on  a  26-week  fetus  and  who  testified  be-fore the Senate Judiciary Committee: 

" `Dr.  Haskell  went  in  with  forceps  and  grabbed  the baby's  legs  and  pulled  them  down  into  the  birth  canal. 
Then he delivered the baby's body and the arms--every-

Opinion of the Court 
thing but the head.  The doctor kept the head right in-side the uterus. . . .  

" `The  baby's  little  fingers  were  clasping  and  unclasp-ing,  and  his  little  feet  were  kicking.  Then  the  doctor 
stuck the scissors in the back of his head, and the baby's arms jerked out, like a startle reaction, like a flinch, like 
a baby does when he thinks he is going to fall. " `The  doctor  opened  up  the  scissors,  stuck  a  high-
powered  suction  tube  into  the  opening,  and  sucked the  baby's  brains  out.  Now  the  baby  went  completely 
limp. . . .  " `He cut the umbilical cord and delivered the placenta. 
He threw the baby in a pan, along with the placenta and the instruments he had just used.' " 

Ibid. 

Dr. Haskell's approach is not the only method of killing the fetus once its head lodges in the cervix, and "the process has 

evolved"  since  his  presentation.  Planned  Parenthood,  320 F.  Supp.  2d,  at  965.  Another  doctor,  for  example,  squeezes 
the skull after it has been pierced "so that enough brain tis-sue  exudes  to  allow  the  head  to  pass  through."  App.  in 
No. 05-380, at 41; see also Carhart,  331 F. Supp. 2d, at 866- 867,  874.  Still  other  physicians  reach  into  the  cervix  with 
their  forceps  and  crush  the  fetus'  skull.  Id.,  at  858,  881. Others  continue  to  pull  the  fetus  out  of  the  woman  until  it 
disarticulates  at  the  neck,  in  effect  decapitating  it.  These doctors  then  grasp  the  head  with  forceps,  crush  it,  and  re-
move  it.  Id.,  at  864,  878;  see  also  Planned  Parenthood, supra, at 965. 

Some  doctors  performing  an  intact  D&E  attempt  to  re-move  the  fetus  without  collapsing  the  skull.  See  Carhart, 
supra, at 866, 869.  Yet one doctor would not allow delivery of a live fetus younger than 24 weeks because "the objective 
of  [his]  procedure  is  to  perform  an  abortion,"  not  a  birth. App. in No. 05-1382, at 408-409.  The doctor thus answered 
in  the  affirmative  when  asked  whether  he  would  "hold  the fetus'  head  on  the  internal  side  of  the  [cervix]  in  order  to

Opinion of the Court 
collapse  the  skull"  and  kill  the  fetus  before  it  is  born.  Id., at  409;  see  also  Carhart,  supra,  at  862,  878.  Another  doc-

tor  testified  he  crushes  a  fetus'  skull  not  only  to  reduce  its size  but  also  to  ensure  the  fetus  is  dead  before  it  is  re-
moved.  For  the  staff  to  have  to  deal  with  a  fetus  that  has "some  viability  to  it,  some  movement  of  limbs,"  according 
to  this  doctor,  "[is]  always  a  difficult  situation."  App.  in No. 05-380, at 94; see 

Carhart, supra, at 858. D&E  and  intact  D&E  are  not  the  only  second-trimester 

abortion  methods.  Doctors  also  may  abort  a  fetus  through medical  induction.  The  doctor  medicates  the  woman  to  in-
duce  labor,  and  contractions  occur  to  deliver  the  fetus.  In-duction,  which  unlike  D&E  should  occur  in  a  hospital,  can 
last  as  little  as  6  hours  but  can  take  longer  than  48.  It accounts  for  about  5  percent  of  second-trimester  abortions 
before  20  weeks  of  gestation  and  15  percent  of  those  after 20  weeks.  Doctors  turn  to  two  other  methods  of  second-
trimester  abortion,  hysterotomy  and  hysterectomy,  only  in emergency  situations  because  they  carry  increased  risk  of 
complications.  In  a  hysterotomy,  as  in  a  cesarean  section, the  doctor removes the  fetus by making an  incision through 
the  abdomen  and  uterine  wall  to  gain  access  to  the  uter-ine  cavity.  A  hysterectomy  requires  the  removal  of  the 
entire  uterus.  These  two  procedures  represent  about  0.07 percent  of  second-trimester  abortions. 

National  Abortion Federation,  330  F.  Supp.  2d,  at  467;  Planned  Parenthood, 

supra, at 962-963.  B 

After  Dr.  Haskell's  procedure  received  public  attention, with ensuing and increasing public concern, bans on " `partial 
birth  abortion' "  proliferated.  By  the  time  of  the  Stenberg decision,  about  30  States  had  enacted  bans  designed  to  pro-
hibit  the  procedure.  530  U. S.,  at  995-996,  and  nn.  12-13 (

Opinion of the Court 
lation, and the Senate failed to override the veto.  Congress approved  another  bill  banning  the  procedure  in  1997,  but 

President  Clinton  again  vetoed  it.  In  2003,  after  this Court's  decision  in  Stenberg,  Congress  passed  the  Act  at 
issue here.  H. R. Rep. No. 108-58, at 12-14.  On November 5,  2003,  President  Bush  signed  the  Act  into  law.  It  was  to 
take  effect  the  following  day.  18  U. S. C.  $ 1531(a)  (2000 ed., Supp. IV). 

The  Act  responded  to  Stenberg  in  two  ways.  First,  Con-gress made factual findings.  Congress determined that this 
Court in Stenberg "was required to accept the very question-able  findings  issued  by  the  district  court  judge,"  $ 2(7),  117 
Stat. 1202, notes following 18 U. S. C. $ 1531 (2000 ed., Supp. IV),  p.  768,  || (7)  (hereinafter  Congressional  Findings),  but 
that  Congress  was  "not  bound  to  accept  the  same  factual findings," 

id.,  || (8).  Congress  found,  among  other  things, that "[a] moral, medical, and ethical consensus exists that the 

practice of performing a partial-birth abortion . . . is a grue-some and inhumane procedure that is never medically neces-
sary and should be prohibited."  Id., || (1). Second, and more relevant here, the Act's language differs 
from  that  of  the  Nebraska  statute  struck  down  in  Stenberg. See 530 U. S., at 921-922 (quoting Neb. Rev. Stat. Ann. $$ 28- 
328(1), 28-326(9) (Supp. 1999)).  The operative provisions of the Act provide in relevant part: 

"(a)  Any  physician  who,  in  or  affecting  interstate  or foreign  commerce,  knowingly  performs  a  partial-birth 
abortion  and  thereby  kills  a  human  fetus  shall  be  fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 2 years, or 
both.  This  subsection  does  not  apply  to  a  partial-birth abortion  that  is  necessary  to  save  the  life  of  a  mother 
whose life is endangered by a physical disorder, physical illness,  or  physical  injury,  including  a  life-endangering 
physical  condition  caused  by  or  arising  from  the  preg-nancy  itself.  This  subsection  takes  effect  1  day  after 
the enactment.

Opinion of the Court 
"(b)  As used in this section-- 
"(1)  the  term  `partial-birth  abortion'  means  an  abor- 
tion in which the person performing the abortion-- 

"(A)  deliberately  and  intentionally  vaginally  delivers 
a  living  fetus  until,  in  the  case  of  a  head-first  presenta-
tion,  the  entire  fetal  head  is  outside  the  body  of  the 
mother,  or,  in  the  case  of  breech  presentation,  any  part 
of  the  fetal  trunk  past  the  navel  is  outside  the  body  of 
the  mother,  for  the  purpose  of  performing  an  overt  act 
that  the  person  knows  will  kill  the  partially  delivered 
living fetus; and 

"(B)  performs the overt act, other than completion of 
delivery,  that  kills  the  partially  delivered  living  fetus; 
and 

"(2)  the  term  `physician'  means  a  doctor  of  medicine 
or  osteopathy  legally  authorized  to  practice  medicine 
and  surgery  by  the  State  in  which  the  doctor  performs 
such  activity,  or  any  other  individual  legally  authorized 
by  the  State  to  perform  abortions:  Provided,  however, 
That any individual who is not a physician or not other-
wise  legally  authorized  by  the  State  to  perform  abor-
tions,  but who nevertheless  directly  performs a  partial-
birth  abortion,  shall be subject  to  the  provisions  of this 
section. . . . . . 

"(d)(1)  A  defendant  accused  of  an  offense  under  this 
section  may  seek  a  hearing  before  the  State  Medical 
Board on whether the physician's conduct was necessary 
to save the life of the mother whose life was endangered 
by  a  physical  disorder,  physical  illness,  or  physical  in-
jury,  including  a  life-endangering  physical  condition 
caused by or arising from the pregnancy itself. 

"(2)  The findings  on that  issue  are  admissible  on  that 
issue  at  the  trial  of  the  defendant.  Upon  a  motion  of 
the defendant, the court shall delay the beginning of the

trial for not more than 30 days to permit such a hearing to take place. 

"(e)  A  woman  upon  whom  a  partial-birth  abortion  is performed may not be prosecuted under this section, for 
a  conspiracy  to  violate  this  section,  or  for  an  offense under  section  2,  3,  or  4  of  this  title based  on  a  violation 
of this section."  18 U. S. C. $ 1531 (2000 ed., Supp. IV). 
The  Act  also  includes  a  provision  authorizing  civil  actions 
that is not of relevance here.  $ 1531(c). 

C 
The  District  Court  in  Carhart  concluded  the  Act  was  un-
constitutional for two reasons.  First, it determined the Act was unconstitutional because it lacked an exception allowing 

the procedure where necessary for the health of the mother. 331  F.  Supp.  2d,  at  1004-1030.  Second,  the  District  Court 
found the  Act deficient because  it  covered  not  merely intact D&E but also certain other D&Es. 

Id., at 1030-1037. 
The  Court  of  Appeals  for  the  Eighth  Circuit  addressed only  the  lack  of  a  health  exception.  413  F.  3d,  at  803-804. 

The  court  began  its  analysis  with  what  it  saw  as  the  appro-
priate  question--"whether  `substantial  medical  authority' supports  the  medical  necessity  of  the  banned  procedure." 

Id.,  at  796  (quoting  Stenberg,  supra,  at  938).  This  was  the proper  framework,  according  to  the  Court  of  Appeals,  be-
cause "when a lack of consensus exists in the medical commu-nity, the Constitution requires legislatures to err on the side 
of  protecting  women's  health  by  including  a  health  excep-tion."  413  F.  3d,  at  796.  The  court  rejected  the  Attorney 
General's  attempt  to  demonstrate  changed  evidentiary  cir-cumstances  since 

Stenberg  and  considered  itself  bound  by 
Stenberg's  conclusion  that  a  health  exception  was  required. 
413  F.  3d,  at  803  (explaining  "[t]he  record  in  [the]  case  and 
the  record  in  Stenberg  [were]  similar  in  all  significant  re-
spects").  It invalidated the Act.  Ibid.

Opinion of the Court 

D 
The  District  Court  in  Planned  Parenthood  concluded  the 
Act  was  unconstitutional  "because  it  (1)  pose[d]  an  undue 
burden  on  a  woman's  ability  to  choose  a  second  trimester 
abortion;  (2)  [was]  unconstitutionally  vague;  and  (3)  re-
quire[d]  a  health  exception  as  set  forth  by  .  .  .  Stenberg." 
320 F. Supp. 2d, at 1034-1035. 

The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit agreed.  Like 
the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, it concluded the 
absence  of  a  health  exception  rendered  the  Act  unconstitu-
tional.  The  court  interpreted  Stenberg  to  require  a  health 
exception unless "there is consensus in the medical commu-
nity that the banned procedure is never medically necessary 
to preserve the health of women."  435 F. 3d, at 1173.  Even 
after applying a deferential standard of review to Congress' 
factual  findings,  the  Court  of  Appeals  determined  "substan-
tial disagreement exists in the medical community regarding 
whether" the procedures prohibited by the Act are ever nec-
essary to preserve a woman's health.  Id., at 1175-1176. 

The  Court  of  Appeals  concluded  further  that  the  Act 
placed  an  undue  burden  on  a  woman's  ability  to  obtain  a 
second-trimester abortion.  The court found the textual dif-
ferences  between  the  Act  and  the  Nebraska  statute  struck 
down  in  Stenberg  insufficient  to distinguish  D&E  and  intact 
D&E.  435  F.  3d,  at  1178-1180.  As  a  result,  according  to 
the  Court of Appeals, the  Act imposed an undue  burden be-
cause it prohibited D&E.  Id., at 1180-1181. 

Finally, the Court of Appeals found the Act void for vague-
ness.  Id., at 1181.  Abortion doctors testified they were un-
certain which procedures the Act made criminal.  The court 
thus concluded the Act did not offer physicians clear warning 
of  its  regulatory  reach.  Id.,  at  1181-1184.  Resting  on  its 
understanding of the remedial framework established by this 
Court  in  Ayotte  v.  Planned  Parenthood  of  Northern  New 
Eng., 546 U. S. 320, 328-330 (2006), the Court of Appeals held

Opinion of the Court 
the Act was unconstitutional on its face and should be perma-nently enjoined.  435 F. 3d, at 1184-1191. 

II 
The  principles  set  forth  in  the  joint  opinion  in  Planned 
Parenthood  of  Southeastern  Pa.  v.  Casey,  505  U. S.  833 
(1992),  did  not  find  support  from  all  those  who  join  the  in-
stant  opinion.  See  id.,  at  979-1002  (Scalia,

Opinion of the Court 
Though all three holdings are implicated in the instant cases, it is the third that requires the most extended discussion; for 

we must determine  whether the  Act  furthers the  legitimate interest of the Government in protecting the life of the fetus 
that may become a child. To  implement  its  holding,  Casey rejected  both  Roe's  rigid 
trimester framework and the interpretation of Roe that con-sidered all previability regulations of abortion unwarranted. 
505  U. S.,  at  875-876,  878  (plurality  opinion).  On  this  point 
Casey  overruled  the  holdings  in  two  cases  because  they  un-dervalued  the  State's  interest  in  potential  life.  See  id.,  at 

881-883 ( joint opinion) (overruling Thornburgh v.  American College  of  Obstetricians  and  Gynecologists,  476  U. S.  747 
(1986), and Akron v.  Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., 462 U. S. 416 (1983)). 

We assume the following principles for the purposes of this opinion.  Before  viability,  a  State  "may  not  prohibit  any 
woman  from  making  the  ultimate  decision  to  terminate  her pregnancy."  505  U. S.,  at  879  (plurality  opinion).  It  also 
may not  impose  upon this  right  an undue  burden,  which ex-ists if a regulation's "purpose or effect is to place a substan-
tial obstacle in the path  of a woman seeking an abortion be-fore  the  fetus  attains  viability." 

Id.,  at  878.  On  the  other hand,  "[r]egulations  which  do  no  more  than  create  a  struc-

tural mechanism by which the State, or the parent or guard-ian  of  a  minor,  may  express  profound  respect  for  the  life  of 
the unborn are permitted, if they are not a substantial obsta-cle  to  the  woman's  exercise  of  the  right  to  choose." 

Id.,  at 
877.  Casey,  in  short,  struck  a  balance.  The  balance  was central  to  its  holding.  We  now  apply  its  standard  to  the 

cases at bar. 

III 

We begin with  a  determination  of the  Act's operation and effect.  A  straightforward  reading  of  the  Act's  text  demon-

strates  its  purpose  and  the  scope  of  its  provisions:  It  regu-

Opinion of the Court 
lates  and  proscribes,  with  exceptions  or  qualifications  to  be discussed, performing the intact D&E procedure. 

Respondents  agree  the  Act  encompasses  intact  D&E,  but they  contend  its  additional  reach  is  both  unclear  and  exces-
sive.  Respondents  assert  that,  at  the  least,  the  Act  is  void for vagueness because its scope is indefinite.  In the alterna-
tive,  respondents  argue  the  Act's  text  proscribes  all  D&Es. Because D&E is the most common second-trimester abortion 
method, respondents suggest the Act imposes an undue bur-den.  In  this  litigation  the  Attorney  General  does  not  dis-
pute that the Act would impose an undue burden if it covered standard D&E. 

We  conclude  that  the  Act  is  not  void  for  vagueness,  does not  impose  an  undue  burden  from  any  overbreadth,  and  is 
not invalid on its face.  A 

The  Act  punishes  "knowingly  perform[ing]"  a  "partial-birth  abortion."  $ 1531(a)  (2000  ed.,  Supp.  IV).  It  defines 
the unlawful abortion in explicit terms.  $ 1531(b)(1). First, the person performing the abortion must "vaginally 
delive[r]  a  living  fetus."  $ 1531(b)(1)(A).  The  Act  does  not restrict  an  abortion  procedure  involving  the  delivery  of  an 
expired fetus.  The Act, furthermore, is inapplicable to abor-tions  that do not  involve vaginal delivery  (for  instance, hys-
terotomy or hysterectomy).  The Act does apply both previ-ability  and  postviability  because,  by  common  understanding 
and scientific terminology, a  fetus is a  living organism  while within  the  womb,  whether  or  not  it  is  viable  outside  the 
womb.  See,  e. g.,  Planned  Parenthood,  320  F.  Supp.  2d,  at 971-972.  We  do  not  understand  this  point  to  be  contested 
by the parties. Second,  the  Act's  definition  of  partial-birth  abortion  re-
quires the fetus to be delivered "until, in the case of a head-first  presentation,  the  entire  fetal  head  is  outside  the  body 
of the mother, or, in the case of breech presentation, any part

Opinion of the Court 
of  the  fetal  trunk  past  the  navel  is  outside  the  body  of  the mother."  $ 1531(b)(1)(A).  The  Attorney  General  concedes, 

and we agree, that if an abortion procedure does not involve the  delivery  of  a  living  fetus  to  one  of  these  "anatomical 
`landmarks' "--where, depending  on the  presentation, either the fetal head or the fetal trunk past the navel is outside the 
body of the mother--the prohibitions of the Act do not apply. Brief for Petitioner in No. 05-380, p. 46. 

Third,  to  fall  within  the  Act,  a  doctor  must  perform  an "overt  act,  other  than  completion  of  delivery,  that  kills  the 
partially  delivered  living  fetus."  $ 1531(b)(1)(B).  For  pur-poses  of  criminal  liability,  the  overt  act  causing  the  fetus' 
death  must  be  separate  from  delivery.  And  the  overt  act must  occur  after  the  delivery  to  an  anatomical  landmark. 
This  is  because  the  Act  proscribes  killing  "the  partially  de-livered" fetus, which, when read in context, refers to a fetus 
that has been delivered to an anatomical landmark.  Ibid. Fourth, the Act contains scienter requirements concerning 
all the actions involved in the prohibited abortion.  To begin with,  the  physician  must  have  "deliberately  and  intention-
ally" delivered the fetus to one of the Act's anatomical land-marks.  $ 1531(b)(1)(A).  If  a  living  fetus  is  delivered  past 
the critical point by accident or inadvertence, the Act is inap-plicable.  In  addition,  the  fetus  must  have  been  delivered 
"for the purpose of performing an overt act that the [doctor] knows  will  kill  [it]."  Ibid.  If  either  intent  is  absent,  no 
crime has occurred.  This follows from the general principle that where scienter is required no crime is committed absent 
the  requisite  state  of  mind.  See  generally  1  W.  LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law $ 5.1 (2d ed. 2003) (hereinafter LaFave);  1  C.  Torcia,  Wharton's  Criminal  Law  $ 27  (15th  ed. 1993).

Respondents  contend  the  language  described  above  is  in-determinate,  and  they  thus  argue  the  Act  is  unconstitution-

Opinion of the Court 
vagueness  doctrine  requires  that  a  penal  statute  define  the criminal  offense  with  sufficient  definiteness  that  ordinary 

people  can  understand  what  conduct  is  prohibited  and  in  a manner  that  does  not  encourage  arbitrary  and  discrimina-
tory  enforcement."  Kolender  v.  Lawson,  461  U. S.  352,  357 (1983); 

Posters  `N'  Things,  Ltd.  v.  United  States,  511  U. S. 
513, 525 (1994).  The Act satisfies both requirements. 

The  Act  provides  doctors  "of  ordinary  intelligence  a  rea-sonable opportunity  to know what  is  prohibited." 

Grayned 
v.  City of Rockford, 408 U. S. 104, 108 (1972).  Indeed, it sets forth  "relatively  clear  guidelines  as  to  prohibited  conduct" 

and  provides  "objective  criteria"  to  evaluate  whether  a 
doctor  has  performed  a  prohibited  procedure.  Posters  `N' 
Things,  supra,  at  525-526.  Unlike  the  statutory  language 
in  Stenberg  that  prohibited  the  delivery  of  a  " `substantial 
portion' "  of  the  fetus--where  a  doctor  might  question  how 
much  of  the  fetus  is  a  substantial  portion--the  Act  defines 
the  line  between  potentially  criminal  conduct  on  the  one 
hand  and  lawful  abortion  on  the  other.  Stenberg,  530  U. S., 
at  922  (quoting  Neb.  Rev.  Stat.  Ann.  $ 28-326(9)  (Supp. 
1999)).  Doctors  performing  D&E  will  know  that  if  they  do 
not deliver a living fetus to an anatomical landmark they will 
not face criminal liability. 

This  conclusion  is  buttressed  by  the  intent  that  must  be 
proved  to  impose  liability.  The  Court  has  made  clear  that 
scienter  requirements  alleviate  vagueness  concerns.  Post-
ers  `N'  Things,  supra,  at  526;  see  also  Colautti v.  Franklin, 
439  U. S.  379,  395  (1979)  ("This  Court  has  long  recognized 
that  the  constitutionality  of  a  vague  statutory  standard  is 
closely  related  to  whether  that  standard  incorporates  a  re-
quirement  of  mens  rea").  The  Act  requires  the  doctor  de-
liberately  to  have  delivered  the  fetus  to  an  anatomical 
landmark.  18  U. S. C.  $ 1531(b)(1)(A)  (2000  ed.,  Supp.  IV). 
Because  a  doctor  performing  a  D&E  will  not  face  criminal 
liability  if  he  or  she  delivers  a  fetus  beyond  the  prohibited 
point by mistake, the Act cannot be described as "a trap for

those who act in good faith."  Colautti, supra, at 395 (inter-nal quotation marks omitted). 

Respondents  likewise  have  failed  to  show  that  the  Act should be invalidated  on its face because  it encourages  arbi-
trary  or  discriminatory  enforcement.  Kolender,  supra,  at 357.  Just as the Act's anatomical landmarks provide doctors 
with objective standards, they also "establish minimal guide-lines  to  govern  law  enforcement." 

Smith  v.  Goguen,  415 U. S. 566, 574 (1974).  The scienter requirements narrow the 

scope  of  the  Act's  prohibition  and  limit  prosecutorial  dis-cretion.  It  cannot  be  said  that  the  Act  "vests  virtually 
complete discretion in the hands  of [law enforcement] to de-termine  whether  the  [doctor]  has  satisfied  [its  provisions]." 
Kolender, supra, at 358 (invalidating a statute regulating loi-tering).  Respondents'  arguments  concerning  arbitrary  en-
forcement,  furthermore,  are  somewhat  speculative.  This  is a preenforcement challenge, where "no evidence has been, or 
could  be,  introduced  to  indicate  whether  the  [Act]  has  been enforced  in  a  discriminatory  manner  or  with  the  aim  of  in-
hibiting [constitutionally protected conduct]."  Hoffman Es-
tates  v.  Flipside,  Hoffman  Estates,  Inc.,  455  U. S.  489,  503 (1982).  The Act is not vague. 

C 
We  next  determine  whether  the  Act  imposes  an  undue burden,  as  a  facial  matter,  because  its  restrictions  on 

second-trimester  abortions  are  too  broad.  A  review  of  the statutory text discloses the limits of its reach.  The Act pro-
hibits  intact  D&E;  and,  notwithstanding  respondents'  argu-ments, it does not prohibit the  D&E procedure in which the 
fetus is removed in parts.  1 

The  Act  prohibits  a  doctor  from  intentionally  performing an  intact  D&E.  The  dual  prohibitions  of  the  Act,  both  of 
which  are  necessary  for  criminal  liability,  correspond  with the  steps  generally  undertaken  during  this  type  of  proce-

550US1 Unit: $U31 [07-28-10 12:14:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court 
dure.  First, a doctor delivers the fetus until its head lodges in the cervix, which is usually past the anatomical landmark 

for  a  breech  presentation.  See  18  U. S. C.  $ 1531(b)(1)(A) (2000  ed., Supp.  IV).  Second,  the  doctor  proceeds to  pierce 
the  fetal  skull  with  scissors  or  crush  it  with  forceps.  This step  satisfies  the  overt-act  requirement  because  it  kills  the 
fetus  and  is  distinct  from  delivery.  See  $ 1531(b)(1)(B). 
The  Act's  intent  requirements,  however,  limit  its  reach  to those physicians who carry out the intact D&E after intend-

ing to undertake both steps at the outset. The  Act  excludes  most  D&Es  in  which  the  fetus  is  re-
moved in pieces, not intact.  If the doctor intends to remove 
the  fetus  in  parts  from  the  outset,  the  doctor  will  not  have 
the requisite intent to incur criminal liability.  A doctor per-
forming  a  standard  D&E  procedure  can  often  "tak[e]  about 
10-15  `passes'  through  the  uterus  to  remove  the  entire 
fetus."  Planned  Parenthood,  320  F.  Supp.  2d,  at  962.  Re-
moving  the  fetus  in  this  manner  does  not  violate  the  Act 
because  the  doctor  will  not  have  delivered  the  living  fetus 
to  one  of  the  anatomical  landmarks  or  committed  an  addi-
tional  overt  act  that  kills  the  fetus  after  partial  delivery. 

$ 1531(b)(1). 

A comparison of the Act with the Nebraska statute struck 
down  in  Stenberg  confirms  this  point.  The  statute  in  Sten-
berg  prohibited  " `deliberately  and  intentionally  delivering 
into the vagina a living unborn child, or a substantial portion 
thereof,  for  the  purpose  of  performing  a  procedure  that  the 
person performing such procedure knows will kill the unborn 
child  and  does  kill  the  unborn  child.' "  530  U. S.,  at  922 
(quoting Neb. Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 28-326(9) (Supp. 1999)).  The 
Court concluded that this statute encompassed D&E because 
"D&E  will  often  involve  a  physician  pulling  a  `substantial 
portion'  of  a  still  living  fetus,  say,  an  arm  or  leg,  into  the 
vagina  prior  to  the  death  of  the  fetus."  530  U. S.,  at  939. 
The Court also rejected the limiting interpretation urged by 
Nebraska's  Attorney  General  that  the  statute's  reference  to

Opinion of the Court 
a  "procedure"  that  " `kill[s]  the  unborn  child' "  was  to  a  dis-tinct  procedure,  not  to  the  abortion  procedure  as  a  whole. 

Id., at 943. Congress,  it  is  apparent,  responded  to  these  concerns  be-
cause  the  Act  departs  in  material  ways  from  the  statute  in 
Stenberg.  It  adopts  the  phrase  "delivers  a  living  fetus," 

$ 1531(b)(1)(A),  instead  of  " `delivering . . . a  living  unborn 
child,  or  a  substantial  portion  thereof,' "  530  U. S.,  at  938 (quoting Neb. Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 28-326(9) (Supp. 1999)).  The 

Act's language, unlike the statute in Stenberg, expresses the usual  meaning  of  "deliver"  when  used  in  connection  with 
"fetus," namely, extraction of an entire fetus rather than re-
moval of fetal pieces.  See Stedman's Medical Dictionary 470 
(27th  ed.  2000)  (defining  deliver  as  "[t]o  assist  a  woman  in 
childbirth"  and  "[t]o  extract  from  an  enclosed  place,  as  the 
fetus from the womb, an object or foreign body"); see also I. 
Dox,  B.  Melloni,  G.  Eisner,  &  J.  Melloni,  The  HarperCollins 
Illustrated  Medical  Dictionary  160  (4th  ed.  2001);  MerriamWebster's  Collegiate  Dictionary  306  (10th  ed.  1997).  The 
Act thus displaces the interpretation of "delivering" dictated 
by  the  Nebraska  statute's  reference  to  a  "substantial  por-
tion"  of  the  fetus.  Stenberg,  supra,  at  944  (indicating  that 
the  Nebraska  "statute  itself  specifies  that  it  applies  both  to 
delivering  `an  intact  unborn  child'  or  `a  substantial  portion 
thereof ' ").  In  interpreting  statutory  texts  courts  use  the 
ordinary  meaning  of  terms  unless  context  requires  a  differ-
ent  result.  See,  e. g.,  2A  N.  Singer,  Sutherland  on  Statutes 
and Statutory Construction $ 47:28 (rev. 6th ed. 2000).  Here, 
unlike in Stenberg, the language does not require a departure 
from  the  ordinary  meaning.  D&E  does  not  involve  the  de-
livery of a fetus because it requires the removal of fetal parts 
that  are  ripped  from  the  fetus  as  they  are  pulled  through 
the cervix. 

The  identification  of  specific  anatomical  landmarks  to 
which  the  fetus  must  be  partially  delivered  also  differen-
tiates  the  Act  from  the  statute  at  issue  in  Stenberg.

Opinion of the Court 

$ 1531(b)(1)(A).  The  Court  in  Stenberg  interpreted  " `sub-stantial portion' " of the fetus to include an arm or a leg.  530 

U. S.,  at  939.  The  Act's  anatomical  landmarks,  by  contrast, clarify  that  the  removal  of  a  small  portion  of  the  fetus  is 
not  prohibited.  The  landmarks  also  require  the  fetus  to  be delivered  so  that  it  is  partially  "outside  the  body  of  the 
mother."  $ 1531(b)(1)(A).  To  come within the  ambit of the 
Nebraska statute, on the other hand, a substantial portion of the fetus only had to be delivered into the vagina; no part of 

the  fetus  had  to  be  outside  the  body  of  the  mother  before  a doctor could face criminal sanctions. 

Id., at 938-939. 
By  adding an overt-act  requirement  Congress sought fur-
ther to meet the  Court's objections  to the state  statute  con-
sidered  in  Stenberg.  Compare  18  U. S. C.  $ 1531(b)(1)  (2000 
ed.,  Supp.  IV)  with  Neb.  Rev.  Stat.  Ann.  $ 28-326(9)  (Supp. 
1999).  The Act  makes  the  distinction  the  Nebraska statute 
failed  to  draw  (but  the  Nebraska  Attorney  General  ad-
vanced)  by  differentiating  between  the  overall  partial-birth 
abortion and the distinct overt  act that kills the fetus.  See 
Stenberg, supra, at 943-944.  The fatal overt act must occur 
after  delivery  to  an  anatomical  landmark,  and  it  must  be 
something  "other  than  [the]  completion  of  delivery. " 

$ 1531(b)(1)(B).  This  distinction  matters  because,  unlike  in-
tact  D&E,  standard  D&E  does  not  involve  a  delivery  fol-
lowed by a fatal act. 

The canon of constitutional avoidance, finally, extinguishes 
any lingering doubt as to whether the Act covers the proto-
typical  D&E  procedure.  " `[T]he  elementary  rule  is  that 
every  reasonable  construction  must  be  resorted  to,  in  order 
to save a statute from unconstitutionality.' "  Edward J. DeBartolo  Corp.  v.  Florida  Gulf  Coast  Building  &  Constr. 
Trades Council, 485  U. S. 568,  575 (1988)  (quoting Hooper v. 
California,  155  U. S.  648,  657  (1895)).  It  is  true  this  long-
standing  maxim of  statutory  interpretation  has, in  the  past, 
fallen  by  the  wayside  when  the  Court  confronted  a  statute 
regulating  abortion.  The  Court  at  times  employed  an  an-

tagonistic  " `canon  of  construction  under  which  in  cases  in-
volving  abortion,  a  permissible  reading  of  a  statute  [was]  to 
be  avoided  at  all  costs.' "  Stenberg,  supra,  at  977  (Ken-
nedy,

Opinion of the Court 
This reasoning, however, does not take account of the Act's intent requirements,  which  preclude liability  from  attaching 

to an accidental intact D&E.  If a doctor's intent at the out-set  is  to  perform  a  D&E  in  which  the  fetus  would  not  be 
delivered to either of the Act's anatomical landmarks, but the fetus  nonetheless  is  delivered  past  one  of  those  points,  the 
requisite and prohibited  scienter  is  not present.  18 U. S. C. 

$ 1531(b)(1)(A)  (2000  ed.,  Supp.  IV).  When  a  doctor  in  that situation  completes  an  abortion  by  performing  an  intact 

D&E,  the  doctor  does  not  violate  the  Act.  It  is  true  that intent to  cause  a result  may sometimes  be inferred  if  a per-
son  "knows  that  that  result  is  practically  certain  to  follow 
from his  conduct."  1  LaFave $ 5.2(a),  at 341.  Yet abortion 
doctors  intending  at  the  outset  to  perform  a  standard  D&E 
procedure will not know that a prohibited abortion "is practi-
cally  certain  to  follow  from"  their  conduct.  Ibid.  A  fetus 
is only delivered largely intact in a small fraction of the over-
all  number  of  D&E  abortions.  Planned  Parenthood,  320 
F. Supp. 2d, at 965. 

The  evidence  also  supports  a  legislative  determination 
that  an  intact  delivery  is  almost  always  a  conscious  choice 
rather  than  a  happenstance.  Doctors,  for  example,  may  re-
move the fetus in a manner that will increase the chances of 
an intact delivery.  See, e. g., App. in No. 05-1382, at 74, 452. 
And intact D&E is usually described as involving some man-
ner of serial dilation.  See, e. g., Dilation and Extraction 110. 
Doctors  who  do  not  seek  to  obtain  this  serial  dilation  per-
form an  intact D&E on  far fewer  occasions.  See,  e. g.,  Car-
hart, 331 F. Supp. 2d, at 857-858 ("In order for intact removal 
to occur on a regular basis, Dr. Fitzhugh would have to dilate 
his  patients  with  a  second  round  of  laminaria").  This  evi-
dence  belies  any  claim  that  a  standard  D&E  cannot  be  per-
formed without intending or foreseeing an intact D&E. 

Many  doctors  who  testified  on  behalf  of  respondents,  and 
who  objected  to  the  Act,  do  not  perform  an  intact  D&E  by 
accident.  On  the  contrary,  they  begin  every  D&E  abortion

156  GONZALES  v.  CARHART 

Opinion of the Court 
with the objective of removing the fetus as intact as possible. 
See,  e. g.,  id.,  at  869  ("Since  Dr.  Chasen  believes  that  the 
intact  D  &  E  is  safer  than  the  dismemberment  D  &  E, 
Dr. Chasen's goal is to perform an intact D & E every time"); 
see also id., at 873, 886.  This does not prove, as respondents 
suggest, that every D&E might violate the Act and that the 
Act  therefore  imposes  an  undue  burden.  It  demonstrates 
only  that  those  doctors  who  intend  to  perform  a  D&E  that 
would  involve  delivery  of  a  living  fetus  to  one  of  the  Act's 
anatomical  landmarks  must  adjust  their  conduct  to  the  law 
by  not  attempting  to  deliver  the  fetus  to  either  of  those 
points.  Respondents have not shown that requiring doctors 
to  intend  dismemberment  before  delivery  to  an  anatomical 
landmark  will  prohibit  the  vast  majority  of  D&E  abortions. 
The  Act,  then,  cannot  be  held  invalid  on  its  face  on  these 
grounds. 

IV 

Under the principles accepted as controlling here, the Act, 
as  we  have  interpreted  it,  would  be  unconstitutional  "if  its 
purpose  or  effect  is  to  place  a  substantial  obstacle  in  the 
path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains 
viability."  Casey, 505 U. S., at 878 (plurality opinion).  The 
abortions  affected  by  the  Act's  regulations  take  place  both 
previability and postviability; so the quoted language and the 
undue  burden  analysis  it  relies  upon  are  applicable.  The 
question  is  whether  the  Act,  measured  by  its  text  in  this 
facial attack, imposes a substantial obstacle to late-term, but 
previability, abortions.  The Act does not on its face impose 
a substantial obstacle, and we reject this further facial chal-
lenge to its validity. 

A 

The  Act's  purposes  are  set  forth  in  recitals  preceding  its 
operative  provisions.  A  description  of  the  prohibited  abor-
tion  procedure  demonstrates  the  rationale  for  the  congres-
sional enactment.  The Act proscribes a method of abortion

approving  such  a  brutal  and  inhumane  procedure  by  choos-ing  not  to  prohibit  it  will  further  coarsen  society  to  the 
humanity of not only newborns,  but all vulnerable and inno-cent  human  life,  making  it  increasingly  difficult  to  protect 
such  life."  Congressional  Findings  || (14)(N).  The  Act  ex-
presses respect for the dignity of human life. Congress was concerned, furthermore, with the effects on 

the  medical  community  and  on  its  reputation  caused  by  the practice  of  partial-birth  abortion.  The  findings  in  the  Act 
explain: 

"Partial-birth  abortion  .  .  .  confuses  the  medical,  legal, 
and ethical duties of physicians to preserve and promote life,  as  the  physician  acts  directly  against  the  physical 

life of a child, whom he or she had just delivered, all but the  head,  out  of  the  womb,  in  order  to  end  that  life." 
Id., || (14)(J). 
There  can  be  no  doubt  the  government  "has  an  interest  in protecting  the  integrity  and  ethics  of  the  medical  profes-

sion."  Washington  v.  Glucksberg,  521  U. S.  702,  731  (1997); 
see  also  Barsky  v.  Board  of  Regents  of  Univ.  of  N. Y.,  347 U. S.  442,  451  (1954)  (indicating  the  State  has  "legitimate 

concern  for  maintaining  high  standards  of  professional  con-duct" in  the practice of medicine).  Under our precedents it 
is  clear  the  State  has  a  significant  role to  play  in  regulating the medical profession. 

Casey  reaffirmed  these  governmental  objectives.  The government  may  use  its  voice  and  its  regulatory  authority 
to  show  its  profound  respect  for  the  life  within  the  woman. 
A central premise of the opinion was that the Court's prece-
dents  after  Roe  had  "undervalue[d]  the  State's  interest  in 
potential life."  505 U. S., at 873 (plurality opinion); see also 
id., at 871.  The plurality opinion indicated "[t]he fact that a 
law which serves a valid purpose, one not designed to strike

Opinion of the Court 
at the right itself, has the incidental effect of making it more 
difficult or more expensive to procure an abortion cannot be 
enough  to  invalidate  it."  Id.,  at  874.  This  was  not  an  idle 
assertion.  The  three  premises  of  Casey  must  coexist.  See 
id.,  at  846  (opinion  of  the  Court).  The  third  premise,  that 
the State, from the inception of the pregnancy, maintains its 
own  regulatory  interest  in  protecting  the  life  of  the  fetus 
that  may  become  a  child,  cannot  be  set  at  naught  by  inter-
preting  Casey's  requirement  of  a  health  exception  so  it  be-
comes  tantamount  to  allowing  a  doctor  to  choose  the  abor-
tion method he or she might prefer.  Where it has a rational 
basis  to  act,  and  it  does  not  impose  an  undue  burden,  the 
State may use its regulatory power to bar certain procedures 
and  substitute  others,  all  in  furtherance  of  its  legitimate in-
terests  in  regulating  the  medical profession  in  order to  pro-
mote respect for life, including life of the unborn. 

The Act's ban on abortions that involve partial delivery of 
a living fetus furthers the Government's objectives.  No one 
would dispute that, for many, D&E is a procedure itself laden 
with the power to devalue human life.  Congress could none-
theless conclude that  the  type of abortion proscribed  by the 
Act  requires  specific  regulation  because  it  implicates  addi-
tional ethical and moral concerns that justify a special prohi-
bition.  Congress  determined  that  the  abortion  methods  it 
proscribed  had  a  "disturbing  similarity  to  the  killing  of  a 
newborn  infant," Congressional Findings || (14)(L), and thus 
it  was  concerned  with  "draw[ing]  a  bright  line  that  clearly 
distinguishes  abortion  and  infanticide,"  id.,  || (14)(G).  The 
Court  has  in  the  past  confirmed  the  validity  of  drawing 
boundaries  to  prevent  certain  practices  that  extinguish  life 
and  are  close  to  actions  that  are  condemned.  Glucksberg 
found  reasonable  the  State's  "fear  that  permitting  assisted 
suicide will start  it down the  path to voluntary  and perhaps 
even  involuntary  euthanasia."  521  U. S.,  at  732-735,  and 
n. 23.

Opinion of the Court 
Respect for human life finds an ultimate expression in the 
bond  of  love  the  mother  has  for  her  child.  The  Act  recog-
nizes  this  reality  as  well.  Whether  to  have  an  abortion  re-
quires  a  difficult  and  painful  moral  decision.  Casey,  supra, 
at 852-853 (opinion of the Court).  While we find no reliable 
data  to  measure  the  phenomenon,  it  seems  unexceptionable 
to conclude some women come to regret their choice to abort 
the  infant  life  they  once  created  and  sustained.  See  Brief 
for  Sandra  Cano  et  al.  as  Amici  Curiae  in  No.  05-380, 
pp. 22-24.  Severe depression and loss of esteem can follow. 
See ibid. 

In a decision so fraught with emotional consequence some 
doctors  may  prefer  not  to  disclose  precise  details  of  the 
means that will be used, confining themselves to the required 
statement  of  risks  the  procedure  entails.  From  one  stand-
point  this  ought  not  to  be  surprising.  Any  number  of  pa-
tients facing imminent surgical procedures would prefer not 
to  hear  all  details,  lest  the  usual  anxiety  preceding  invasive 
medical procedures become the more intense.  This is likely 
the  case  with  the  abortion  procedures  here  in  issue.  See, 
e. g., National Abortion Federation, 330  F. Supp. 2d,  at 466, 
n.  22  ("Most  of  [the  plaintiffs']  experts  acknowledged  that 
they  do  not  describe  to  their  patients  what  [the  D&E  and 
intact  D&E]  procedures  entail  in  clear  and  precise  terms"); 
see also id., at 479. 

It  is,  however,  precisely  this  lack  of  information  concern-
ing the way in which the fetus will be killed that is of legiti-
mate  concern  to  the  State.  Casey,  supra,  at  873  (plurality 
opinion)  ("States are  free  to enact  laws to  provide a  reason-
able framework for a woman to make a decision that has such 
profound  and  lasting  meaning").  The  State  has  an  interest 
in  ensuring  so  grave  a  choice  is  well  informed.  It  is  self-
evident  that  a  mother  who  comes  to  regret  her  choice  to 
abort  must  struggle  with  grief  more  anguished  and  sorrow 
more  profound  when  she  learns,  only  after  the  event,  what

Opinion of the Court 
she  once  did  not  know:  that  she  allowed  a  doctor  to  pierce the skull and vacuum the fast-developing brain of her unborn 

child, a child assuming the human form. It  is  a  reasonable  inference  that  a  necessary  effect  of  the 
regulation and the knowledge it conveys will be to encourage some  women  to  carry  the  infant  to  full  term,  thus  reducing 
the  absolute  number  of  late-term  abortions.  The  medical 
profession, furthermore, may find different and less shocking methods  to  abort  the  fetus  in  the  second  trimester,  thereby 

accommodating  legislative  demand.  The  State's  interest  in respect  for  life  is  advanced  by  the  dialogue  that  better  in-
forms the political and legal systems, the medical profession, 
expectant  mothers,  and  society  as  a  whole  of  the  conse-
quences  that  follow  from  a  decision  to  elect  a  late-term 
abortion. 

It  is  objected  that  the  standard  D&E  is  in  some  respects 
as brutal, if not more, than the intact D&E, so that the legis-
lation accomplishes little.  What we have already said, how-
ever,  shows  ample  justification  for  the  regulation.  Partial-
birth abortion, as defined by the Act, differs from a standard 
D&E  because  the  former  occurs  when  the  fetus  is  partially 
outside the mother to the point of one of the Act's anatomical 
landmarks.  It  was  reasonable  for  Congress  to  think  that 
partial-birth  abortion,  more  than  standard  D&E,  "under-
mines  the  public's  perception  of  the  appropriate  role  of  a 
physician during the delivery process, and perverts a process 
during which life is brought into the world."  Congressional 
Findings  || (14)(K).  There  would  be  a  flaw  in  this  Court's 
logic, and an irony in its jurisprudence, were we first to con-
clude  a  ban  on  both  D&E  and  intact  D&E  was  overbroad 
and  then  to  say  it  is  irrational  to  ban  only  intact  D&E  be-
cause  that does  not  proscribe  both procedures.  In  sum,  we 
reject  the  contention  that  the  congressional  purpose  of  the 
Act  was  "to  place  a  substantial  obstacle  in  the  path  of  a 
woman  seeking  an  abortion."  505  U. S.,  at  878  (plurality 
opinion).

Opinion of the Court 

B 
The  Act's  furtherance  of  legitimate  government  interests bears upon, but does not resolve, the next question: whether 

the Act has the effect of imposing an unconstitutional burden on  the  abortion  right  because  it  does  not  allow  use  of  the 
barred procedure where  " `necessary, in appropriate medical judgment,  for  the  preservation  of  the  .  .  .  health  of  the 
mother.' "  Ayotte,  546  U. S.,  at  327-328  (quoting  Casey, 
supra, at 879 (plurality opinion)).  The prohibition in the Act would be unconstitutional, under precedents we here assume 

to  be  controlling,  if  it  "subject[ed]  [women]  to  significant health  risks." 

Ayotte,  supra,  at  328; see  also  Casey,  supra, at  880  (opinion  of  the  Court).  In  Ayotte  the  parties  agreed 

a  health  exception  to  the  challenged  parental-involvement statute  was  necessary  "to  avert  serious  and  often  irrevers-
ible  damage  to  [a  pregnant  minor's]  health."  546  U. S.,  at 328.  Here,  by contrast,  whether the  Act creates  significant 
health risks for women has been a contested factual question. The  evidence  presented  in  the  trial  courts  and  before  Con-
gress  demonstrates  both  sides  have  medical  support  for their position. 

Respondents presented  evidence  that  intact D&E  may  be the  safest  method  of  abortion,  for  reasons  similar  to  those 
adduced  in  Stenberg.  See  530  U. S.,  at  932.  Abortion  doc-tors  testified,  for  example,  that  intact  D&E  decreases  the 
risk  of  cervical  laceration  or  uterine  perforation  because  it requires  fewer  passes  into  the  uterus  with  surgical  instru-
ments  and  does  not  require  the  removal  of  bony  fragments of  the  dismembered  fetus,  fragments  that  may  be  sharp. 
Respondents  also  presented  evidence  that  intact  D&E  was safer  both  because  it  reduces  the  risks  that  fetal  parts  will 
remain  in  the  uterus  and  because  it  takes  less  time  to  com-plete.  Respondents, in addition, proffered evidence that in-
tact  D&E  was  safer  for  women  with  certain  medical  condi-tions  or  women  with  fetuses  that  had  certain  anomalies. 
See,  e. g.,  Carhart,  331  F.  Supp.  2d,  at  923-929;  National

Abortion  Federation,  330  F.  Supp.  2d,  at  470-474;  Planned 
Parenthood, 320 F. Supp. 2d, at 982-983. 

These contentions were contradicted by other doctors who testified  in  the  District  Courts  and  before  Congress.  They 

concluded  that  the  alleged  health  advantages  were  based on  speculation  without  scientific  studies  to  support  them. 
They considered D&E always to be a safe alternative.  See, 
e. g., Carhart, supra, at 930-940; National Abortion Federa-
tion,  supra,  at  470-474;  Planned  Parenthood,  320  F.  Supp. 
2d, at 983. There  is  documented  medical  disagreement  whether  the 

Act's  prohibition  would  ever  impose  significant  health  risks 
on  women.  See,  e. g.,  id.,  at  1033  ("[T]here  continues  to  be 
a  division  of  opinion  among  highly  qualified  experts  re-
garding  the  necessity  or  safety  of  intact  D  &  E");  see  also 
National  Abortion  Federation,  supra,  at  482.  The  three 
District  Courts  that  considered  the  Act's  constitutionality 
appeared to be  in  some disagreement on  this  central factual 
question.  The  District  Court  for  the  District  of  Nebraska 
concluded  "the  banned  procedure  is,  sometimes,  the  safest 
abortion  procedure  to  preserve  the  health  of  women." 
Carhart,  supra,  at 1017.  The District  Court for  the North-
ern  District  of  California  reached  a  similar  conclusion. 
Planned Parenthood, supra, at 1002 (finding intact D&E was 
"under certain circumstances . . . significantly safer than D & 
E by disarticulation").  The District Court for the Southern 
District  of  New  York  was  more  skeptical  of  the  purported 
health benefits of intact D&E.  It found the Attorney Gener-
al's "expert witnesses reasonably and effectively refuted [the 
plaintiffs'] proffered  bases for the  opinion that  [intact D&E] 
has  safety  advantages  over  other  second-trimester  abortion 
procedures."  National  Abortion  Federation,  330  F.  Supp. 
2d, at 479.  In addition it  did "not  believe that many of [the 
plaintiffs']  purported  reasons  for  why [intact  D&E]  is  medi-
cally  necessary  [were]  credible;  rather  [it  found  them  to  be] 
theoretical or false."  Id., at 480.  The court nonetheless in-

Opinion of the Court 
validated  the  Act  because  it  determined  "a  significant  body of  medical  opinion  .  .  .  holds  that  D  &  E  has  safety  advan-

tages  over induction  and  that [intact  D&E]  has  some safety advantages  (however  hypothetical  and  unsubstantiated  by 
scientific  evidence)  over D & E  for  some  women  in  some circumstances." 

Ibid. 
The  question  becomes  whether  the  Act  can  stand  when 
this  medical  uncertainty  persists.  The  Court's  precedents instruct  that  the  Act  can  survive  this  facial  attack.  The 

Court  has  given  state  and  federal  legislatures  wide  discre-tion  to  pass  legislation  in  areas  where  there  is  medical  and 
scientific  uncertainty.  See  Kansas  v.  Hendricks,  521  U. S. 
346,  360,  n.  3  (1997);  Jones  v.  United  States,  463  U. S.  354,

(plurality opinion) (criticizing Roe's trimester framework be-cause, 

inter alia, it "left this Court to serve as the country's 
ex  officio  medical  board  with  powers  to  approve  or  disap-prove  medical  and  operative  practices  and  standards 

throughout  the  United  States"  (internal  quotation  marks omitted)); 

Mazurek  v.  Armstrong,  520  U. S.  968,  973  (1997) 
(per curiam)  (upholding a restriction  on the  performance of 
abortions to licensed physicians despite the respondents' con-tention  "all  health  evidence  contradicts  the  claim  that  there 

is  any  health  basis  for  the  law"  (internal  quotation  marks omitted)). 

Medical uncertainty does not foreclose the exercise of leg-
islative power in the abortion context any more than it does 
in other contexts.  See Hendricks, supra, at 360, n. 3.  The 
medical  uncertainty  over  whether  the  Act's  prohibition  cre-
ates significant health risks provides a sufficient basis to con-
clude  in  this  facial  attack  that  the  Act  does  not  impose  an 
undue burden. 

The conclusion that the Act does not impose an undue bur-
den  is  supported  by  other  considerations.  Alternatives  are 
available  to  the  prohibited  procedure.  As  we  have  noted, 
the Act does not proscribe D&E.  One District Court found 
D&E  to  have  extremely  low  rates  of  medical  complications. 
Planned  Parenthood,  supra,  at  1000.  Another  indicated 
D&E  was  "generally  the  safest  method  of  abortion  during 
the  second  trimester."  Carhart,  331  F.  Supp.  2d,  at  1031; 
see  also  National  Abortion  Federation,  supra,  at  467-468 
(explaining  that  "[e]xperts  testifying  for  both  sides"  agreed 
D&E  was  safe).  In  addition  the  Act's  prohibition  only  ap-
plies  to  the  delivery  of  "a  living  fetus. "  18  U. S. C. 

$ 1531(b)(1)(A) (2000 ed., Supp. IV).  If the intact D&E pro-
cedure  is  truly  necessary  in  some  circumstances,  it  appears 
likely an injection that kills the fetus is an alternative under 
the Act that allows the doctor to perform the procedure. 

The  instant  cases,  then,  are  different  from  Planned  Par-
enthood  of  Central  Mo.  v.  Danforth,  428  U. S.  52,  77-79

Opinion of the Court 
(1976),  in  which  the  Court  invalidated  a  ban  on  saline  am-niocentesis,  the  then-dominant  second-trimester  abortion 

method.  The  Court  found  the  ban  in  Danforth  to  be  "an unreasonable or arbitrary regulation designed to inhibit, and 
having the effect of inhibiting, the vast majority of abortions after  the  first  12  weeks." 

Id.,  at  79.  Here  the  Act  allows, 
among other means, a commonly used and generally accepted 
method, so it does not construct a substantial obstacle to the abortion right. 

In  reaching  the  conclusion  the  Act  does  not  require  a health  exception  we  reject  certain  arguments  made  by  the 
parties  on  both  sides  of  these  cases.  On  the  one  hand,  the 
Attorney  General  urges  us  to  uphold  the  Act  on  the  basis 
of  the  congressional  findings  alone.  Brief  for  Petitioner  in 
No.  05-380,  at  23.  Although  we  review  congressional  fact-
finding under a deferential standard, we do not in the circum-
stances  here  place  dispositive  weight  on  Congress'  findings. 
The  Court  retains  an  independent  constitutional  duty  to  re-
view  factual  findings  where  constitutional  rights  are  at 
stake.  See  Crowell  v.  Benson,  285  U. S.  22,  60  (1932)  ("In 
cases  brought  to  enforce  constitutional  rights,  the  judicial 
power  of  the  United  States  necessarily  extends  to  the  inde-
pendent determination of all questions, both of fact and law, 
necessary to the performance of that supreme function"). 

As respondents have noted, and the District Courts recog-
nized,  some  recitations  in  the  Act  are  factually  incorrect. 
See  National  Abortion Federation, 330  F.  Supp.  2d,  at  482, 
488-491.  Whether  or not  accurate at  the  time,  some of  the 
important  findings  have  been  superseded.  Two  examples 
suffice.  Congress determined no medical schools provide in-
struction on the prohibited procedure.  Congressional Find-
ings  || (14)(B).  The  testimony  in  the  District  Courts,  how-
ever, demonstrated intact D&E is taught at medical schools. 
National Abortion Federation, supra, at 490; Planned Par-
enthood, 320 F. Supp. 2d, at 1029.  Congress also found there 
existed  a  medical  consensus  that  the  prohibited  procedure

Opinion of the Court 
is never  medically  necessary.  Congressional  Findings || (1). The  evidence  presented  in  the  District  Courts  contradicts 

that  conclusion.  See,  e. g.,  Carhart,  supra,  at  1012-1015; 
National  Abortion  Federation,  supra,  at  488-489;  Planned 
Parenthood,  supra,  at  1025-1026.  Uncritical  deference  to Congress' factual findings in these cases is inappropriate. 

On the other hand, relying on the Court's opinion in Sten-
berg,  respondents  contend  that  an  abortion  regulation  must contain  a  health  exception  "if  `substantial  medical  authority 

supports the proposition that banning a particular procedure could endanger women's health.' "  Brief for Respondents in 
No.  05-380,  p.  19  (quoting  530  U. S.,  at  938);  see  also  Brief 
for Respondent Planned Parenthood et al. in No. 05-1382, at 
12  (same).  As  illustrated  by  respondents'  arguments  and 
the  decisions  of  the  Courts  of  Appeals,  Stenberg  has  been 
interpreted  to  leave  no  margin  of  error  for  legislatures  to 
act  in  the  face  of  medical  uncertainty.  Carhart,  413  F.  3d, 
at 796; Planned Parenthood, 435 F. 3d, at 1173; see also Na-
tional Abortion Federation, 437  F.  3d, at  296  (Walker,  C. J., 
concurring)  (explaining  the  standard  under  Stenberg  "is  a 
virtually insurmountable evidentiary hurdle"). 

A zero tolerance policy would strike down legitimate abor-
tion  regulations,  like  the  present  one,  if  some  part  of  the 
medical  community  were  disinclined  to  follow  the  proscrip-
tion.  This is too exacting a standard to impose on the legis-
lative power, exercised in this instance under the Commerce 
Clause,  to  regulate  the  medical  profession.  Considerations 
of marginal safety, including the balance of risks, are within 
the  legislative  competence  when  the  regulation  is  rational 
and  in  pursuit  of  legitimate  ends.  When  standard  medical 
options  are  available,  mere  convenience  does  not  suffice  to 
displace  them;  and  if  some  procedures  have  different  risks 
than  others,  it  does  not  follow  that  the  State  is  altogether 
barred  from  imposing  reasonable  regulations.  The  Act  is 
not  invalid  on  its  face  where  there  is  uncertainty  over 
whether the barred procedure is ever necessary to preserve

Opinion of the Court 
a  woman's  health,  given  the  availability  of  other  abortion procedures that are considered to be safe alternatives. 

V 
The considerations we have discussed support our further determination that these facial attacks should not have been 

entertained in the first instance.  In these circumstances the proper  means  to  consider  exceptions  is  by  as-applied  chal-
lenge.  The Government has acknowledged that preenforce-ment,  as-applied  challenges  to  the  Act  can  be  maintained. 
Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 05-380, pp. 21-23.  This is the proper manner to protect the health of the woman if it can be shown 
that in discrete and well-defined instances a particular condi-tion  has  or  is  likely  to  occur  in  which  the  procedure  prohib-
ited  by  the  Act  must  be  used.  In  an  as-applied  challenge the  nature  of  the  medical  risk  can  be  better  quantified  and 
balanced than in a facial attack. The  latitude  given  facial  challenges  in  the  First  Amend-
ment  context  is  inapplicable  here.  Broad  challenges  of  this type impose  "a heavy burden"  upon  the  parties maintaining 
the suit.  Rust v.  Sullivan, 500 U. S. 173, 183 (1991).  What that  burden  consists  of  in  the  specific  context  of  abortion 
statutes  has  been  a  subject  of  some  question.  Compare 
Ohio v.  Akron Center for Reproductive Health, 497 U. S. 502, 514 (1990) ("[B]ecause appellees are making a facial challenge 

to  a  statute,  they  must  show  that  no  set  of  circumstances exists  under  which  the  Act  would  be  valid"  (internal  quota-
tion  marks  omitted)),  with  Casey,  505  U. S.,  at  895  (opinion of the Court) (indicating a spousal-notification statute would 
impose  an  undue  burden  "in  a  large  fraction  of  the  cases  in which  [it]  is  relevant"  and  holding  the  statutory  provision 
facially  invalid).  See  also  Janklow  v.  Planned  Parenthood, 
Sioux  Falls  Clinic,  517  U. S.  1174  (1996).  We  need  not  re-solve that debate. 

As  the  previous  sections  of  this  opinion  explain,  respond-ents have not demonstrated that the Act would be unconsti-

for crimes that "otherwise involv[e] conduct that presents a serious po-
tential risk of physical injury to another."  Pp. 196-197. 

(ii)  ACCA's text does not exclude attempt offenses from the resid-
ual provision's scope.  James' claim that clause (i)'s express inclusion of 
attempts,  combined  with  clause  (ii)'s  failure  to  mention  them,  demon-
strates  an  intent  to  categorically  exclude  them  from  clause  (ii)  would 
unduly narrow the residual provision, which does not suggest any intent 
to  exclude  attempts  that  otherwise  meet  the  statutory  criteria.  See, 
e. g.,  Chevron  U.  S.  A.  Inc.  v.  Echazabal,  536  U. S.  73,  80.  James  also 
argues  to  no  avail  that,  under  the  ejusdem  generis  canon,  the  residual 
provision must be read to extend only to completed offenses because the 
specifically enumerated offenses--burglary, arson, extortion, and explo-
sives  crimes--all  have  that  common  attribute.  Rather,  the  most  rele-
vant  common  attribute  of  the  enumerated  offenses  is  that,  while  not 
technically  crimes  against  the  person,  they  nevertheless  create  signifi-
cant  risks  of  bodily  injury  to  others,  or  of  violent  confrontation  that 
could lead to such  injury.  See, e. g., Taylor, supra,  at 597.  The inclu-
sion of the residual provision indicates Congress' intent that the preced-
ing enumerated offenses not be an exhaustive list.  Pp. 198-200. 

(iii)  Nor does the legislative history exclude attempt offenses from 
ACCA's  residual  provision.  Whatever  weight  might  ordinarily  be 
given  the  House's  1984  rejection  of  language  that would  have  included 
attempted robbery and attempted burglary as ACCA predicate offenses, 
it  is not probative  here  because the  1984  action was not Congress' last 
word on the subject.  Since clause (ii)'s residual provision was added to 
ACCA  in  1988,  Congress'  1984  rejection  of  the  language  including  at-
tempt offenses is not dispositive.  Pp. 200-201. 

(b)  Attempted burglary, as defined by Florida law, "involves conduct 
that  presents  a  serious  potential  risk  of  physical  injury  to  another" 
under  the  residual  provision.  Under  the  "categorical  approach"  it  has 
used for other ACCA offenses, the Court considers whether the offense's 
elements are of the type that would justify its inclusion within the resid-
ual  provision,  without  inquiring  into  the  particular  offender's  specific 
conduct.  See, e. g., Taylor, supra, at 602.  Pp. 201-212. 

(i)  On  its  face,  Florida's  attempt  statute  requires  only  that  a  de-
fendant take "any act toward the commission" of burglary.  But because 
the Florida  Supreme Court's Jones decision considerably narrowed  the 
application of this broad language in the context of attempted burglary, 
requiring an overt act directed toward entering or remaining in a struc-
ture, merely preparatory activity posing no real danger of harm to oth-
ers,  e. g., acquiring  burglars' tools  or  casing  a  structure,  is not  enough.

Syllabus 
(ii)  Overt  conduct  directed  toward  unlawfully  entering  or  remain-
ing in a dwelling, with the intent to commit a felony therein, "presents 
a serious potential risk of physical injury to another" under the residual 
provision  of  clause  (ii).  The  clause's  enumerated  offenses  provide  one 
baseline  from  which  to  measure  whether  similar  conduct  satisfies  the 
quoted  language.  Here,  the risk  posed  by  attempted  burglary  is  com-
parable  to  that  posed  by  its  closest  analog  among  the  enumerated  of-
fenses, completed burglary.  See Taylor, supra, at 600, n. 9.  The main 
risk  of  burglary  arises  not  from  the  simple  physical  act  of  wrongfully 
entering  another's  property,  but  from  the  possibility  that  an  innocent 
person  might  confront  the  burglar  during  the  crime.  Attempted  bur-
glary  poses  the  same  kind  of  risk.  Indeed,  that  risk  may  be  even 
greater  than  the  risk  posed  by  a  typical  completed  burglary.  Many 
completed burglaries do not involve confrontations, but attempted bur-
glaries  often  do.  Every  Court  of  Appeals  that  has  construed  an  at-
tempted burglary law similar to Florida's has held that attempted bur-
glary qualifies as a "violent felony."  Support is also found in the U. S. 
Sentencing  Commission's  determination that a  predicate  "crime  of vio-
lence"  for  purposes  of  the  Sentencing  Guidelines'  career  offender  en-
hancement  "include[s]  .  .  .  attempting  to  commit  [an]  offens[e]."  See 
Guidelines Manual $ 4B1.2, comment., n. 1.  Pp. 203-207. 

(iii)  Neither  ACCA  nor  Taylor  supports  James'  argument  that, 
under  the  categorical  approach,  attempted  burglary  cannot  be  treated 
as an ACCA predicate offense unless all cases present a risk of physical 
injury  to  others.  ACCA  does  not  require  such  certainty,  and  James' 
argument misapprehends Taylor, under which the proper inquiry is not 
whether  every  factual  offense  conceivably  covered  by  a  statute  nec-
essarily  presents  a  serious  potential  risk  of  injury,  but  whether  the 
conduct  encompassed  by  the  offense's  elements,  in  the  ordinary  case, 
presents such a risk.  Pp. 207-209. 

(c)  James'  argument  that  the  scope  of  Florida's  underlying  burglary 
statute itself precludes treating attempted burglary as an ACCA pred-
icate  offense  is  not  persuasive.  Although  the  state-law  definition  of 
"[d]welling"  to  include  the  "curtilage  thereof,"  Fla.  Stat.  $ 810.011(2), 
takes  Florida's  underlying  burglary  offense  outside  Taylor's  "generic 
burglary"  definition,  495  U. S.,  at  598,  that  is  not  dispositive  because 
the  Government  does  not  argue  that  James'  conviction  constitutes 
"burglary"  under  ACCA.  Rather,  it  relies  on  the  residual  provision, 
which--as  Taylor  recognized--can  cover  conduct  outside  the  strict 
definition of, but nevertheless similar to, generic burglary.  Id., at 600, 
n. 9.  The Florida Supreme Court's Hamilton decision construed curti-
lage narrowly, requiring some form of enclosure for the area surround-

ing  a  residence.  A  burglar  illegally  attempting  to  enter  the  curtilage 
around  a  dwelling  creates  much  the  same  risk  of  confrontation  as  one 
attempting to enter the structure itself.  Pp. 212-213. 

(d)  Because  the  Court  is  here  engaging  in  statutory  interpretation, 
not judicial factfinding, James' argument that construing attempted bur-
glary as a violent felony raises Sixth Amendment issues under Apprendi

196  JAMES  v.  UNITED  STATES 

Opinion of the Court 
admitted  to  the  three  prior  felony  convictions  listed  in  his federal  indictment.  These  included  a  conviction  in  Florida 

state court for attempted burglary of a dwelling, in violation of Fla. Stat. $$ 810.02 and 777.04 (1993).

1 

At  sentencing,  the  Government  argued  that  James  was subject  to  ACCA's  15-year  mandatory  minimum  term  be-

cause  of  his  three  prior  convictions.  James  objected,  ar-guing that his attempted burglary conviction did not qualify 
as a "violent felony" under 18 U. S. C. $ 924(e).  The District Court  held  that  attempted  burglary  is  a  violent  felony,  and 
the  Court  of  Appeals  for  the  Eleventh  Circuit  affirmed  that holding, 430 F. 3d 1150, 1157 (2005).  We granted certiorari, 
547 U. S. 1191 (2006).  II 

A 
ACCA's 15-year mandatory minimum applies "[i]n the case of a person who violates section 922(g) of this title [the felon 

in  possession  of  a  firearm  provision]  and  has  three  previous convictions . . . for a violent felony or a serious drug offense, 
or both, committed on occasions different from one another." $ 924(e)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. IV).  ACCA defines a "violent fel-
ony" as 

"any  crime  punishable  by  imprisonment  for  a  term  ex-ceeding one year . . . that-- 

"(i)  has  as  an  element  the  use,  attempted  use,  or threatened  use  of  physical  force  against  the  person  of 
another; or "(ii)  is  burglary,  arson,  or  extortion,  involves  use  of 
explosives,  or  otherwise  involves  conduct  that  presents a  serious  potential  risk  of  physical  injury  to  another." 

$ 924(e)(2)(B). 
1 James' two other prior convictions--for possession of cocaine and traf-
ficking in cocaine--were determined to be "serious drug offense[s]" under 
ACCA,  see  18  U. S. C.  $ 924(e)(1)  (2000  ed.,  Supp.  IV),  and  are  not  at 
issue here.

Opinion of the Court 
Florida defined the crime of burglary at the time of James' 
conviction as follows: " `Burglary' means entering or remain-
ing  in  a  structure  or  a  conveyance  with  the  intent  to  com-
mit  an  offense  therein,  unless  the  premises  are  at  the  time 
open  to  the  public  or  the  defendant  is  licensed  or  invited  to 
enter or remain."  Fla. Stat.  $ 810.02(1).  Florida's  criminal 
attempt statute provided: "A person who attempts to commit 
an  offense  prohibited  by  law  and  in  such  attempt  does  any 
act  toward  the  commission  of  such  offense,  but  fails  in  the 
perpetration  or  is  intercepted  or  prevented  in  the  execu-
tion  thereof,  commits  the  offense  of  criminal  attempt." 

$ 777.04(1).  The attempted burglary conviction at issue here 
was  punishable  by  imprisonment  for  a  term  exceeding  one 
year. 

The  parties  agree  that  attempted  burglary  does  not  qual-
ify as a "violent felony" under clause (i) of ACCA's definition 
because  it  does  not  have  "as  an  element  the  use,  attempted 
use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of 
another."  18  U. S. C.  $ 924(e)(2)(B)(i).  Nor  does  it  qualify 
as  one  of  the  specific  crimes  enumerated  in  clause  (ii).  At-
tempted  burglary  is  not  arson  or  extortion.  It  does  not  in-
volve  the  use  of  explosives.  And  it  is  not  "burglary"  be-
cause  it  does  not  meet  the  definition  of  burglary  under 
ACCA  that  this  Court  set  forth  in  Taylor  v.  United  States, 
495 U. S. 575, 598  (1990): "an  unlawful or unprivileged  entry 
into,  or  remaining  in,  a  building  or  other  structure,  with  in-
tent to commit a crime."  See Fla. Stat. $ 777.04(1) (crime of 
attempt  under  Florida  law  requires  as  an  element  that  the 
defendant  "fai[l]  in  the  perpetration  or  [be]  intercepted  or 
prevented in the execution" of the underlying offense). 

The question before the Court, then, is whether attempted 
burglary,  as  defined  by  Florida  law,  falls  within  ACCA's  re-
sidual provision for crimes that "otherwise involv[e] conduct 
that  presents  a  serious  potential  risk  of  physical  injury  to 
another."  18 U. S. C. $ 924(e)(2)(B)(ii).

198  JAMES  v.  UNITED  STATES 

Opinion of the Court 

B 
Before  determining  whether  the  elements  of  attempted burglary  under  Florida  law  qualify  under  ACCA's  residual 

provision,  we  first  consider  James'  argument  that  the  stat-ute's  text  and  structure  categorically  exclude  attempt  of-
fenses  from  the  scope  of  the  residual  provision.  We  con-clude  that  nothing  in  the  plain  language  of  clause  (ii),  when 
read together with the rest of the statute, prohibits attempt offenses  from  qualifying  as  ACCA  predicates  when  they  in-
volve conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physi-cal injury to another. 

James first argues that the residual provision of clause (ii) must  be  read  in  conjunction  with  clause  (i),  which  ex-
pressly  includes  in  its  definition  of  "violent  felony"  offenses that have "as an element the . . .  attempted use . . . of physical 
force  against  the  person  of  another."  $ 924(e)(2)(B)(i)  (em-phasis added).  James thus concludes that Congress' express 
inclusion  of attempt  offenses  in  clause  (i),  combined with  its failure  to  mention  attempts  in  clause  (ii),  demonstrates  an 
intent to categorically exclude attempt offenses from the lat-ter provision. 

We are not persuaded.  James' reading would unduly nar-row  clause  (ii)'s  residual  provision,  the  language  of  which 
does not suggest any intent to exclude attempt offenses that otherwise  meet  the  statutory  criteria.  Clause  (i),  in  con-
trast, lacks a broad residual provision, thus making it neces-sary to specify exactly what types of offenses--including at-
tempt offenses--are covered by its language.  In short, "the expansive phrasing of " clause (ii) "points directly away from 
the  sort  of  exclusive  specification"  that  James  would  read into  it. 

Chevron  U. S. A.  Inc.  v.  Echazabal,  536  U. S.  73,  80 (2002);  see  also  United  States  v.  Davis,  16  F.  3d  212,  217 

(CA7) (rejecting argument that "had Congress wished to in-clude  attempted  burglary  as  a  $ 924(e)  predicate  offense,  it 
would  have  done  so  expressly"  as  "untenable  in  light  of  the very  existence  of  the  `otherwise'  clause,  which  Congress

Opinion of the Court 
plainly  included  to  serve  as  a  catch-all  provision"),  cert.  de-nied, 513 U. S. 945 (1994). 

James  next  invokes  the  canon  of  ejusdem  generis--that when a general phrase follows a list of specifics, it should be 
read to include only things of the same type as those specifi-cally  enumerated.  He  argues  that  the  "common  attribute" 
of  the  offenses  specifically  enumerated  in  clause  (ii)--bur-glary, arson, extortion, and crimes involving the use of explo-
sives--is that they are all completed offenses.  The residual provision,  he  contends,  should  similarly  be  read  to  extend 
only to completed offenses. This  argument  is  unavailing.  As  an  initial  matter,  the 
premise  on  which  it  depends--that  clause  (ii)'s  specifically enumerated  crimes  are  limited  to  completed  offenses--is 
false.  An  unsuccessful  attempt  to  blow  up  a  government building, for example, would qualify as a specifically enumer-
ated  predicate  offense  because  it  would  "involv[e]  [the]  use of  explosives."  See, 

e. g.,  $ 844(f)(1)  (2000  ed.,  Supp.  IV) (making  it  a  crime  to  "maliciously  damag[e]  or  destro[y],  or 

attemp[t] to damage or destroy, by means of fire or an explo-sive,"  certain  property  used  in  or  affecting  interstate  com-
merce (emphasis added)). In  any  event,  the  most  relevant  common  attribute  of  the 
enumerated offenses of burglary, arson, extortion, and explo-sives use  is not "completion."  Rather, it  is that all of these 
offenses,  while  not  technically  crimes  against  the  person, nevertheless  create  significant  risks  of  bodily  injury  or  con-
frontation  that  might  result  in  bodily  injury.  As  we  noted in 

Taylor: 

"Congress  thought  that  certain  general  categories  of property crimes--namely burglary, arson, extortion, and 

the use of explosives--so often presented a risk of injury to persons, or were so often committed by career crimi-
nals,  that  they  should  be  included  in  the  enhancement statute  even though,  considered  solely  in  terms  of  their 
statutory  elements,  they  do  not  necessarily  involve  the

Opinion of the Court 
use  or  threat  of  force  against  a  person."  495  U. S., at 597. 

See  also  id.,  at  588  (noting  that  Congress  singled  out  bur-glary  because  it  "often  creates  the  possibility  of  a  violent 
confrontation"); United States v.  Adams,  51 Fed.  Appx.  507, 508  (CA6  2002)  (arson  presents  "a  serious  potential  risk  of 
physical injury to another" because "[n]ot only might the tar-geted  building  be  occupied,"  but  also  "the  fire  could  harm 
firefighters and onlookers and could spread to occupied struc-tures"); H. R. Rep. No. 99-849, p. 3 (1986) (purpose of clause 
(ii)  was  to  "add  State  and  Federal  crimes  against  property such as burglary, arson, extortion, use of explosives and simi-
lar  crimes  as  predicate  offenses  where  the  conduct  involved presents a serious risk of injury to a person"). 

Congress'  inclusion of a broad  residual provision in  clause (ii) indicates that it did not intend the preceding enumerated 
offenses  to  be  an  exhaustive  list  of  the  types  of  crimes  that might present a serious risk of injury to others and therefore 
merit  status  as  a  $ 924(e)  predicate  offense.  Nothing  in  the statutory  language  supports  the  view  that  Congress  in-
tended to limit this category solely to completed offenses.

James also relies on ACCA's legislative history to buttress his  argument  that  clause  (ii)  categorically  excludes  attempt 

offenses.  In  the  deliberations  leading  up  to  ACCA's  adop-tion in 1984, the House rejected a version of the statute that 
would have provided enhanced penalties for use of a firearm by  persons  with  two  prior  convictions  for  "any  robbery  or 
burglary offense, or a conspiracy or attempt to commit such 
an offense."  S. 52, 98th Cong., 2d Sess., $ 2 (1984) (emphasis added).  The  bill  that  ultimately  became  law  omitted  any 

reference  to  attempts,  and  simply  defined  "violent  felony" to  include  "robbery  or  burglary,  or  both."  Armed  Career 
Criminal  Act  of  1984,  $ 1802,  98  Stat.  2185,  repealed  in  1986 by  Pub.  L.  99-308,  $ 104(b),  100  Stat.  459.  James  argues

Opinion of the Court 
that  Congress'  rejection  of  this  explicit  "attempt"  language in  1984  evidenced  an  intent  to  exclude  attempted  burglary 

as a predicate offense. Whatever  weight  this  legislative  history  might  ordinarily 
have,  we  do  not  find  it  probative  here,  because  the  1984  en-actment  on  which  James  relies  was  not  Congress'  last  word 
on  the  subject.  In  1986,  Congress  amended  ACCA  for  the purpose  of  " `expanding'  the  range  of  predicate  offenses." 
Taylor,  supra,  at  584.  The  1986  amendments  added  the more expansive language that is at issue in this case--includ-
ing clause (ii)'s language defining as violent felonies offenses that are "burglary, arson, or extortion, involv[e] use of explo-
sives, or  otherwise involv[e]  conduct that  presents a  serious potential  risk  of  physical  injury  to  another."  Career  Crim-
inals  Amendment  Act  of  1986,  $ 1402(b),  100  Stat.  3207- 40,  codified  at  18  U. S. C.  $ 924(e)(2)(B)(ii).  This  language 
is  substantially  broader  than  the  1984  provision  that  it amended.  Because  both  the  Government  and  the  Court  of 
Appeals  relied  on  the  broader  language  of  the  1986  amend-ments--specifically,  the  residual  provision--as  the  textual 
basis  for  including  attempted  burglary  within  the  law's scope,  Congress'  rejection  of  express  language  including  at-
tempt offenses in the 1984 provision is not dispositive.  Con-gress  did  not  consider,  much  less  reject,  any  such  language 
when  it  enacted  the  1986  amendments.  What  it  did  con-sider, and ultimately adopted, was a broadly worded residual 
clause  that  does  not  by  its  terms  exclude  attempt  offenses, and whose reach is broad enough to encompass at least some 
such offenses.  III 

Having  concluded  that  neither  the  statutory  text  nor  the legislative history discloses any congressional intent to cate-
gorically  exclude  attempt  offenses  from  the  scope  of $ 924(e)(2)(B)(ii)'s residual provision, we next ask whether at-
tempted  burglary,  as  defined  by  Florida  law,  is  an  offense that "involves conduct  that presents a serious  potential risk

of  physical  injury  to  another."  In  answering  this  question, we  employ  the  " `categorical  approach' "  that  this  Court  has 

taken  with  respect  to  other  offenses  under  ACCA.  Under this  approach,  we  " `look  only  to  the  fact  of  conviction  and 
the  statutory  definition  of  the  prior  offense,' "  and  do  not generally consider the "particular facts disclosed by the rec-
ord  of  conviction."  Shepard  v.  United  States,  544  U. S.  13, 
17  (2005)  (quoting  Taylor,  495  U. S.,  at  602).  That  is,  we consider whether the 

elements of the offense are of the type 
that would justify its inclusion within the residual provision, without  inquiring into  the  specific  conduct  of  this  particular 

offender.  A 

We  begin  by  examining  what  constitutes  attempted  bur-glary under Florida law.  On its face, Florida's attempt stat-
ute  requires only that  a defendant take "any  act  toward the commission" of burglary.  Fla. Stat. $ 777.04(1).  James con-
tends  that  this  broad  statutory  language  sweeps  in  merely preparatory  activity  that  poses  no  real  danger  of  harm  to 
others--for  example,  acquiring  burglars'  tools  or  casing  a structure while planning a burglary. 

But  while  the  statutory  language  is  broad,  the  Florida Supreme  Court  has  considerably  narrowed  its  application 
in  the  context  of  attempted  burglary,  requiring  an  "overt 
act  directed  toward  entering  or  remaining  in  a  structure  or conveyance." 

Jones  v.  State,  608  So.  2d  797,  799  (1992). 
Mere preparation is not enough.  See ibid.2  Florida's lower 

2 The  Jones  court  distinguished  its  earlier  holding  in  Thomas  v.  State, 
531 So. 2d  708 (1988).  There,  the State Supreme Court  upheld  a convic-
tion  under  a  state  statute  criminalizing  the  possession  of  burglary  tools, 
Fla. Stat.  $ 810.06,  where the  defendant  had been  arrested  after jumping 
a fence and trying to run away from police while carrying a screwdriver. 
Jones  held  that  "the  overt  act  necessary  to  convict  of  the  burglary  tool 
crime  is  not  the  same  as  the  overt  act  required  to  prove  attempted  bur-
glary," and noted that the conduct charged in Thomas would not be suffi-
cient to prove attempted burglary because the defendant in that case com-

Opinion of the Court 
courts  appear  to  have  consistently  applied  this  heightened standard.  See, e. g., Richardson v.  State, 922 So. 2d 331, 334 

(App. 2006); Davis v.  State, 741 So. 2d 1213, 1214 (App. 1999). The  pivotal  question,  then,  is  whether  overt  conduct  di-
rected  toward  unlawfully  entering  or  remaining  in  a  dwell-ing,  with  the  intent  to  commit  a  felony  therein,  is  "conduct 
that  presents  a  serious  potential  risk  of  physical  injury  to another."  18 U. S. C. $ 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). 

B 
In  answering  this  question,  we  look  to  the  statutory  lan-guage  for  guidance.  The  specific  offenses  enumerated  in 

clause  (ii)  provide  one  baseline  from  which  to  measure whether other similar conduct "otherwise . . . presents a seri-
ous  potential  risk  of  physical  injury."  In  this  case,  we  can ask  whether  the  risk  posed  by  attempted  burglary  is  com-
parable  to  that  posed  by  its  closest  analog  among  the  enu-merated  offenses--here,  completed  burglary.  See 

Taylor, 
supra,  at  600,  n. 9  ("The  Government remains  free  to  argue that  any  offense--including  offenses  similar  to  generic  bur-

glary--should  count  towards  enhancement  as  one  that  `oth-erwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk 
of physical injury to another' under $ 924(e)(2)(B)(ii)"). The main risk of burglary arises not from the simple physi-
cal  act  of  wrongfully  entering  onto  another's  property,  but rather from the possibility of a face-to-face confrontation be-
tween  the  burglar  and  a  third  party--whether  an  occupant, a  police  officer,  or  a  bystander--who  comes  to  investigate. 
That  is,  the  risk  arises  not  from  the  completion  of  the  bur-glary, but from the possibility that an innocent person might 
appear while the crime is in progress. Attempted  burglary  poses  the  same  kind  of  risk.  In-
terrupting  an  intruder  at  the  doorstep  while  the  would-be burglar  is  attempting  a  break-in  creates  a  risk  of  violent 

mitted  no  overt  act  directed  toward  entering  or  remaining  in  a  building.

Opinion of the Court 
confrontation comparable to that posed by finding him inside the structure itself.  As one court has explained: 

"In  all  of  these  cases  the  risk  of  injury  arises,  not  from the completion of the break-in, but rather from the pos-
sibility  that  some  innocent  party  may  appear  on  the scene  while  the  break-in  is  occurring.  This  is  just  as 
likely to happen before the defendant succeeds in break-ing  in  as  after.  Indeed,  the  possibility  may  be  at  its 
peak while the defendant is still outside trying to break in,  as  that  is  when  he  is  likely  to  be  making  noise  and 
exposed to the public view.  . . . [T]here is a  serious risk of  confrontation  while  a  perpetrator  is  attempting  to 
enter  the  building."  United  States  v.  Payne,  966  F.  2d 4, 8 (CA1 1992). 

Indeed,  the  risk  posed by  an attempted  burglary that  can serve  as  the  basis  for  an  ACCA  enhancement  may  be  even 
greater  than  that  posed  by  a  typical  completed  burglary. All  burglaries  begin  as  attempted  burglaries.  But  ACCA 
only concerns that subset of attempted burglaries where the offender  has  been  apprehended,  prosecuted,  and  convicted. 
This  will  typically  occur  when  the  attempt  is  thwarted  by some  outside intervenor--be  it  a  property  owner  or law  en-
forcement  officer.  Many  completed  burglaries  do  not  in-volve  such  confrontations.  But  attempted  burglaries  often 
do; indeed, it is often just such outside intervention that pre-vents the attempt from ripening into completion. 

Concluding  that  attempted  burglary  presents  a  risk  that is  comparable  to  the  risk  posed  by  the  completed  offense, 
every Court of Appeals that has construed an attempted bur-glary  law  similar  in  scope  to  Florida's  has  held  that  the 
offense  qualifies  as  a  "violent  felony"  under  clause  (ii)'s  re-sidual  provision.

Opinion of the Court 
by  that  State's  highest  court,  requires an  overt act  directed toward  the  entry  of  a  structure,  we  need  not  consider 

whether  the  more  attenuated  conduct  encompassed  by  such laws presents a potential risk of serious injury under ACCA. 

The  United  States  Sentencing  Commission  has  come  to  a similar conclusion with regard to the Sentencing Guidelines' 
career offender enhancement, whose definition of a predicate 
"crime  of  violence"  closely  tracks  ACCA's  definition  of  "vio-lent  felony."  See  United  States  Sentencing  Commission, 

Guidelines  Manual  $ 4B1.2(a)(2)  (Nov.  2006)  (USSG).  The Commission  has  determined  that  "crime[s]  of  violence"  for 
the  purpose  of  the  Guidelines  enhancement  "include  the  of-fenses  of  aiding  and  abetting,  conspiring,  and  attempting  to 
commit such offenses."  $ 4B1.2, comment., n. 1.  This judg-ment was based on the Commission's review of empirical sen-
tencing data  and presumably reflects an assessment that at-tempt crimes often pose a similar risk of injury as completed 
offenses.  As  then-Chief  Judge  Breyer  explained,  "[t]he 
Commission,  which  collects  detailed  sentencing  data  on  vir-
tually  every  federal  criminal  case,  is  better  able  than  any 
individual  court  to  make  an  informed  judgment  about  the 
relation between"  a  particular offense and "the  likelihood of 
accompanying  violence."  United  States  v.  Doe,  960  F.  2d 
221,  225  (CA1  1992);  see  also  USSG  $ 1A3  (Nov.  1987),  re-

as  making  a  duplicate  key,  `casing'  the  targeted  building,  obtaining  floor 
plans of a structure, or possessing burglary tools."  United States v.  Per-
menter,  969  F.  2d  911,  913  (CA10  1992),  similarly  excluded  a  conviction 
under  an  Oklahoma  statute  that  could  be  satisfied  by  the  defendant's 
"merely  `casing'  the  targeted  structure."  In  United  States  v.  Martinez, 
954 F. 2d 1050, 1054 (1992), the Fifth Circuit came to the same conclusion 
as  to  a  Texas  attempted  burglary  statute  that  did  not  require  that  the 
defendant  be  "in  the  vicinity  of  any  building."  And  in  United  States  v. 
Weekley, 24 F. 3d  1125, 1127  (CA9  1994), the Court of  Appeals concluded 
that ACCA was not satisfied by a conviction under a Washington law that 
covered "relatively unrisky" conduct such as casing the neighborhood, se-
lecting  a  house  to  burgle,  and  possessing  neckties  to  be  used  in  the 
burglary.

James  responds  that  it  is  not  enough  that  attempted  bur-glary  " `generally' " or in " `most  cases' "  will create  a risk of 

physical  injury  to  others.  Brief  for  Petitioner  32.  Citing the  categorical  approach  we  employed  in  Taylor,  he  argues 
that we cannot treat attempted burglary as an ACCA predi-cate offense unless all cases present such a risk.  James' ap-
proach  is  supported  by  neither  the  statute's  text  nor  this Court's holding in Taylor. 

One  could,  of  course,  imagine  a  situation  in  which  at-tempted burglary might not pose a realistic risk of confronta-
tion or injury to anyone--for example, a break-in of an unoc-cupied  structure  located  far  off  the  beaten  path  and  away 
from any potential intervenors.  But ACCA does not require metaphysical  certainty.  Rather,  $ 924(e)(2)(B)(ii)'s  residual 
provision  speaks  in  terms  of  a  "potential  risk."  These  are inherently  probabilistic  concepts.

5  Indeed,  the  combination 

of the two terms suggests that Congress intended to encom-pass possibilities even more contingent or remote than a sim-

5 See, e. g., Black's Law Dictionary 1188 (7th ed. 1999) (potential: "[c]apa-

injury,  damage,  or  loss;  danger  or  hazard");  Webster's  Third  New  Inter-
national  Dictionary  1775 (1971)  (potential: "existing  in  possibility:  having 
the capacity or a strong possibility for development into a state of actual-
ity");  id.,  at  1961  (risk:  "the  possibility  of  loss,  injury,  disadvantage,  or 
destruction").

Opinion of the Court 
ple "risk," much less a certainty.  While there may be some 
attempted burglaries that do not present a serious potential 
risk  of  physical  injury  to  another,  the  same  is  true  of  com-
pleted burglaries--which are explicitly covered by the statu-
tory language and provide a baseline against which to meas-
ure  the  degree  of  risk  that  a  nonenumerated  offense  must 
"otherwise" present in order to qualify. 

James'  argument  also  misapprehends  Taylor's  categorical 
approach.  We  do  not  view  that  approach  as  requiring  that 
every  conceivable  factual  offense  covered  by  a  statute  must 
necessarily  present  a  serious  potential  risk  of  injury  before 
the  offense can  be deemed a violent felony.  Cf. Gonzales v. 
Duenas-Alvarez,  549  U. S.  183,  193  (2007)  ("[T]o  find  that  a 
state  statute  creates  a  crime  outside  the  generic  definition 
of a listed crime  in  a  federal statute requires more than  the 
application of legal imagination to a state statute's language. 
It  requires  a  realistic  probability,  not  a  theoretical  possibil-
ity,  that  the  State  would  apply  its  statute  to  conduct  that 
falls outside the generic definition of a crime"). 

Rather, the proper inquiry is whether the conduct encom-
passed  by  the  elements  of  the  offense,  in  the  ordinary  case, 
presents  a  serious  potential  risk  of  injury  to  another.  One 
can always hypothesize unusual cases in which even a proto-
typically  violent  crime  might  not  present  a  genuine  risk  of 
injury--for  example,  an  attempted  murder  where  the  gun, 
unbeknownst  to  the  shooter,  had  no  bullets,  see  United 
States  v.  Thomas,  361  F.  3d  653,  659  (CADC  2004).  Or,  to 
take an example from the offenses specifically enumerated in 

$ 924(e)(2)(B)(ii),  one  could  imagine  an  extortion  scheme 
where  an  anonymous  blackmailer  threatens  to  release  em-
barrassing personal information about the victim unless he is 
mailed regular payments.  In both cases, the risk of physical 
injury to another  approaches zero.  But that does  not mean 
that the offenses of attempted murder or extortion are cate-
gorically nonviolent.

Opinion of the Court 
As  long  as  an  offense  is  of  a  type  that,  by  its  nature,  pre-sents a serious potential risk of injury to another, it satisfies 

the  requirements  of  $ 924(e)(2)(B)(ii)'s  residual  provision. Attempted  burglary  under  Florida  law--as  construed  in 
Jones  to  require  an  overt  act  directed  toward  entry  of  a structure--satisfies this test.

Opinion of the Court 
sons and the reasons discussed above, we are convinced that the offense of attempted burglary, as defined by Florida law, 

qualifies under ACCA's residual clause. 

IV 
Although the question on which this Court granted certio-rari focused on the attempt prong of Florida's attempted bur-

glary  law,  James  also  argues  that  the  scope  of  the  State's underlying  burglary  statute  itself  precludes  treating  at-
tempted  burglary  as  a  violent  felony  for  ACCA  purposes. Specifically, he argues that Florida's burglary statute differs 
from "generic"  burglary as defined  in  Taylor,  supra,  at 598, because  it  defines  a  " `[d]welling' "  to  include  not  only  the 
structure  itself,  but  also  the  "curtilage  thereof," 7  Fla.  Stat. $ 810.011(2). 

We  agree  that  the  inclusion  of  curtilage  takes  Florida's underlying  offense  of  burglary  outside  the  definition  of 
"generic burglary" set forth in Taylor, which requires an un-lawful entry into, or remaining in, "a building or other struc-
ture."  495 U. S., at 598 (emphasis added).  But that conclu-sion  is  not  dispositive,  because  the  Government  does  not 
argue  that  James'  conviction  for  attempted  burglary  consti-tutes "burglary" under $ 924(e)(2)(B)(ii).  Rather, it relies on 
the  residual  provision  of  that  clause,  which--as  the  Court has  recognized--can  cover  conduct  that  is  outside  the  strict 
definition  of,  but  nevertheless  similar  to,  generic  burglary. 
Id., at 600, n. 9. Is  the  risk  posed  by  an  attempted  entry  of  the  curtilage

7 Burglary under Florida law differs from "generic" burglary in a second 
respect:  It  extends  not  just  to  entries  of  structures,  but  also  of  "convey-
ance[s]."  Fla.  Stat.  $ 810.02(1).  But  because  James  (in  accordance  with 
what  appears  to  be  the  general  practice  in  Florida)  was  specifically 
charged  with  and  convicted  of  "attempted  burglary  of  a  dwelling," we  
need not examine this point further.

Opinion of the Court 
under the residual provision)?  We must again turn to state law in order to answer this question. 

The  Florida  Supreme  Court  has  construed  curtilage  nar-rowly, requiring "some form of an enclosure in order for the 
area  surrounding  a  residence  to  be  considered  part  of  the `curtilage'  as  referred  to  in  the  burglary  statute."  State  v. 
Hamilton,  660  So.  2d  1038,  1044  (1995)  (holding  that  a  yard surrounded  by  trees  was  not  "curtilage");  see  also 

United States v.  Matthews, 466 F. 3d 1271, 1274 (CA11 2006) ("Flor-

ida case law construes curtilage narrowly, to include only an enclosed area surrounding a structure").  Given this narrow 
definition,  we  do  not  believe  that  the  inclusion  of  curtilage so mitigates the risk presented by attempted  burglary as to 
take  the  offense  outside  the  scope  of  clause  (ii)'s  residual provision. 

A  typical  reason  for  enclosing  the  curtilage  adjacent  to  a structure is to keep out unwanted visitors--especially those 
with  criminal  motives.  And  a  burglar  who  illegally  at-tempts  to  enter  the  enclosed  area  surrounding  a  dwelling 
creates  much  the  same  risk  of  physical  confrontation  with  a property  owner,  law  enforcement  official,  or  other  third 
party as does one who attempts to enter the structure itself. In light of Florida's narrow definition of curtilage, attempted 
burglary of the curtilage requires both physical proximity to the structure and an overt act directed toward breaching the 
enclosure.  Such  an  attempt  "presents  a  serious  potential risk  that  violence  will  ensue  and  someone  will  be  injured." 
Id., at 1275 (holding that burglary of the curtilage is a violent felony under ACCA's residual provision). 

V 
Finally, James argues that construing attempted burglary as a violent felony raises Sixth Amendment issues under 

Ap-prendi  v.  New  Jersey,  530  U. S.  466  (2000),  and  its  progeny 

because  it  is  based  on  "judicial  fact  finding"  about  the  risk presented  by  "the  acts  that  underlie  `most'  convictions  for

Opinion of the Court 
The  trial  judge  instructed  the  jury  to  take  into  consider-ation  evidence  presented  at  the  guilt  phase  as  well  as  the 

sentencing  phase  of  the  trial but  made  no  reference  to  miti-gating evidence.  Under the provisions of the Texas criminal 
code,  the  jury's  affirmative  answers  to  these  two  special  is-sues  required  the  judge  to  impose  a  death  sentence.  See 
Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 37.071 (Vernon 2006). At  the  sentencing  hearing,  the  State  introduced  evidence 
that  Cole  pleaded  guilty  to  an  earlier  murder  when  he  was only  16.  Shortly  after  being  released  on  parole,  Cole 
pleaded  guilty  to  charges  of  aggravated  sexual  assault  on 
two boys and was sentenced to 15 more years in prison.  As evidence  of  Cole's  propensity  for  future  dangerousness,  the 

State introduced Cole's diary which, according to the State's expert  psychiatrist,  Dr.  Richard  Coons,  revealed  a  compul-
sive  attraction  to  young  boys  and  an  obsession  with  crim-inal  activity.  Dr.  Coons  described  Cole  as  a  sociopath 
who  lacked  remorse  and  would  not  profit  or  learn  from  his experiences. 

In  response,  Cole  presented  two  categories  of  mitigating 
evidence.  The  first  consisted  of  testimony  from  his  mother and  his  aunt,  who  described  his  unhappy  childhood.  Cole's 

parents  lived  together  "off  and  on"  for  10  years,  over  the course of which they had two children, Cole, and his younger 
sister, Carla.  App. 35.  Shortly after Cole was born, his fa-ther  was  arrested  for  robbing  a  liquor  store.  Cole's  father 
deserted  the  family  several  times,  abandoning  the  family completely before Cole was five years old.  On the last occa-
sion  that  Cole  saw  his  father,  he  dropped  Cole  off  a  block from where  he thought Cole's  mother lived, told Cole to "go 

"[w]hether, taking into consideration all of the evidence, including the cir-
cumstances of the offense, the defendant's character and background, and 
the personal  moral culpability of  the defendant, there  is a  sufficient miti-
gating  circumstance  or  circumstances  to  warrant  that  a  sentence  of  life 
imprisonment  without  parole  rather  than  a  death  sentence  be  imposed."

explained,  the  defendant  had  introduced  some  rather  atypi-
cal mitigating evidence that was not expressly authorized by 
the Florida statute: 

"In  the  sentencing  phase  of  this  case,  petitioner's  coun-
sel introduced before the advisory jury evidence that as 
a  child  petitioner  had  the  habit  of  inhaling  gasoline 
fumes  from  automobile  gas  tanks;  that  he  had  once 
passed  out  after  doing  so;  that  thereafter  his  mind 
tended to wander; that petitioner had been one of seven 
children  in  a  poor  family  that  earned  its  living  by  pick-

petitioner  had  been  a fond  and affectionate uncle  to  the 
children of one of his brothers."  481 U. S., at 397.

strued the state statute to preclude consideration of mitigat-
ing  factors  unmentioned  in  the  statute.  Accordingly,  de-

Opinion of the Court 
" `Do  you  find  from  the  evidence  beyond  a  reasonable doubt  that  there  is  a  probability  that  the  defendant, 

BRENT  RAY  BREWER,  would  commit  criminal  acts of  violence  that  would  constitute  a  continuing  threat  to 
society?' "  442 F. 3d, at 277. 
In closing argument, the prosecutor emphasized that Brewer's  violent  response  to  his  father's  extensive  physical 

abuse  of  both  Brewer  and  his  mother  supported  an  affirma-tive answer to the "future dangerousness" special issue.  In 
contrast,  he  deemphasized  any  mitigating  effect  that  such evidence  should  have  on  the  jury's  determination  of  Brew-
er's fate: 

"And,  you  know,  folks,  you  can  take  a  puppy,  and  you can beat that puppy and you can make him mean, but if 

that dog bites, he is going to bite the rest of his life, for whatever reason. 
"Whatever got him to this point, he is what he is today. And that will never change.  That will never change. 
"All  that's  happened  to this  time  or  all those  years can-not  change  the  violence  and  the  cold,  cold-bloodedness 
that  he's  exhibited  right  here.  Not  one  tear.  Not  one tear, because life means nothing to him.  Zero. 
"You  go  back,  you  look  at  the  evidence  and  you  decide, not because of a poor family and not because of the sur-
vivors, because of the evidence that you see that he has 
shown."  App. 118. 

The prosecutor  stressed that  the  jurors lacked  the  power  to exercise  moral  judgment  in  determining  Brewer's  sentence, 

admonishing  them  that  "[y]ou  don't  have  the  power  to  say whether  [Brewer]  lives  or  dies.  You  answer  the  questions 
according to the evidence, mu[ch] like you did at the guilt or innocence

Opinion of the Court 
consideration of a defendant's mitigating evidence when that evidence functions as a "two-edged sword."  As the District 

Court  explained  in  its  opinion  granting  habeas  corpus  relief in this case: 

"The mitigating evidence presented may have served as a basis for mercy even if a jury decided that the murder 
was  committed deliberately  and  that Petitioner  posed  a continuing threat.  Without  an instruction,  much  less a 
special  issue on  mitigation,  this  evidence  was  out of the jury's  reach.  Given  the  nature  of  the  mitigating  evi-
dence before the jury and the lack of any instruction on mitigation, there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury 
applied its instructions in a way that prevented the con-sideration  of  the  mitigating  evidence.  Reviewing  the 
evidence  in  light  of  the  special  issues,  a  jury  would  be very hard pressed to see the evidence presented as any-
thing but aggravating.  Failure to submit an instruction on  mitigation  evidence  was  an  unreasonable  applica-
tion  of  federal  law  and  Supreme  Court  precedent.  Ac-cordingly,  habeas  relief  on  this  issue  is  conditionally 
granted."  No. Civ.A.2:01-CV-0112- J, at 9, App. 196. 
In  reversing  the  District  Court's  grant  of  habeas  relief, and  rejecting  that  court's  conclusion  that  Brewer's  mitigat-

ing  evidence  was  effectively  "out  of  the  jury's  reach,"  the Court  of  Appeals  mischaracterized  the  law  as  demanding 
only  that  such  evidence  be  given  "sufficient  mitigating  ef-fect,"  and  improperly  equated  "sufficient  effect"  with  "full 
effect." 7  This  is  not  consistent  with  the  reasoning  of  our 

7 The  Court  of  Appeals  explained:  "For  the  mitigating  evidence  to  be 
within the effective reach of the jury in answering the special issues, the 
special interrogatories must be capable of giving relevant evidence consti-
tutionally  sufficient  mitigating  effect.  Whether  that  sufficiency  requires 
that  the  evidence  be  given  `full,'  or  merely  `some,'  mitigating  effect  has 
been  the  subject  of  considerable  discussion  in  this  court,  but  ultimately 
the  distinction  is  only  one  of  semantics,  because  regardless  of  what  label 
is put on the word `effect,' it is indisputable that the effect must be consti-

though Smith's second state habeas petition included an argument that 
the  nullification  charge  itself  prevented  the  jury  from  considering  his 
mitigating  evidence,  that  was  not  the  only,  or  even  the  primary,  argu-
ment  he  presented  to  the  appeals  court  and  this  Court.  The  parties' 
post-trial  filings,  the  state  courts'  judgments,  and  Smith  I  make  clear 
that Smith challenged the special issues before trial and did not abandon 
or transform that claim during lengthy post-trial proceedings.  Regard-
less  of  how  the  State  now  characterizes  it,  Smith's  pretrial  claim  was 
treated  by  the  appeals  court  as  a  Penry  challenge  to  the  adequacy  of 
the special issues in his case, that is how this Court treated it in Smith 
I,  and  that  was the  error  on  which  this  Court  granted  relief.  The  ap-
peals  court's  misinterpretation  of  federal  law  on  remand  from  Smith  I 
cannot form the basis for the imposition of an adequate and independent 
state procedural bar.  Ake v.  Oklahoma, 470 U. S. 68, 75.  Pp. 312-315. 

2.  The  state  courts  that  reviewed  Smith's  case  did  not  indicate  that 
he  failed  to  preserve  his  claim  that  the  special  issues  were  inadequate 
in  his  case.  Under  the  appeals  court's  application  of  Almanza,  pre-
served error is subject only to normal harmless-error review.  The ap-
peals court has indicated elsewhere that so long as there is a reasonable 
likelihood  the  jury  believed  it  was  not  permitted  to  consider  relevant 
mitigating evidence, the lower Almanza standard is met.  Because the 
state court must defer to this Court's finding of Penry error, which is a 
finding that there is a reasonable likelihood the jury believed it was not 
permitted  to  consider  Smith's relevant  mitigating  evidence,  Johnson  v. 
Texas, 509 U. S. 350, 367, it appears Smith is entitled to relief under the 
state harmless-error framework.  Pp. 315-316.

300  SMITH  v.  TEXAS 

Opinion of the Court 
of  some  forms  of  mitigating  evidence.  Following  a  pretrial challenge  to  the  special  issues  by  Smith,  the  trial  court  is-

sued  a  charge  instructing  the  jury  to  nullify  the  special  is-sues  if  the  mitigating  evidence,  taken  as  a  whole,  convinced 
the  jury  Smith  did  not  deserve  the  death  penalty.  After Smith's  trial,  Penry  II  held  a  similar  nullification  charge  in-
sufficient  to  cure  the  flawed  special  issues.  Smith,  on  state collateral review, continued to seek relief based on the inade-
quacy  of  the  special  issues,  arguing  that  the  nullification charge  had  not  remedied  the  problem  identified  in  his  pre-
trial  objection.  The  Texas  Court  of  Criminal  Appeals  af-firmed  the  denial  of  relief,  distinguishing  Smith's  case  from 
the  Penry  precedents.  Ex  parte  Smith,  132  S.  W.  3d  407 (2004). 

This  Court,  by  summary  disposition,  reversed.  Smith  v. 
Texas,  543  U. S.  37  (2004)  (per  curiam)  (Smith  I).  On  re-mand  the  Court  of  Criminal  Appeals  again  denied  Smith 

relief.  It  held,  for  the  first  time,  that  Smith's  pretrial  ob-jections  did  not  preserve  the  claim  of  constitutional  error 
he  asserts.  Under  the  Texas  framework  for  determining whether  an  instructional  error  merits  reversal,  the  state 
court  explained,  this  procedural  default  required  Smith  to show  egregious  harm--a  burden  the  court  held  he  did  not 
meet.  Ex  parte  Smith,  185  S.  W.  3d  455,  467-473  (2006). The requirement that Smith show egregious harm was predi-
cated,  we  hold,  on  a  misunderstanding  of  the  federal  right Smith asserts; and we therefore reverse. 

I 
A 
The Special Issues 

Under  Texas  law  the  jury  verdict  form  provides  special-issue questions to guide the jury in determining whether the 

death  penalty  should  be  imposed.  At  the  time  of  Smith's trial,  Texas  law  set  forth  three  special  issues.  The  first 
addressed  deliberateness;  the  second  concerned  future  dan-

550US1 Unit: $U35 [07-22-10 14:36:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court 
gerousness;  and  the  third  asked  whether  the  killing  was  an unreasonable  response  to  provocation  by  the  victim. 

Provocation  was  not  applicable  to  Smith's  case  so  the  third question  was  not  included  in  the  instructions.  If  the  jury 
answered  the  two  applicable  special-issue  questions  in  the affirmative, the death penalty would be imposed. 

In  Penry  I,  the  Court  held  that  neither  of  these  special-
issue instructions was "broad enough to provide a vehicle for the  jury  to  give  mitigating  effect"  to  the  evidence  at  issue 

in  that  case.  Penry  II,  supra,  at  798  (citing,  and  charac-terizing, 

Penry  I,  supra,  at  322-325).  We  refer  to  the  in-
adequacy  of  the  special-issue  instructions  as  "Penry  error." 

For the brief period between Penry I and the Texas Legis-
lature's  addition  of  a  catchall  special  issue,  Texas  courts  at-
tempted to cure Penry error with a nullification charge.  In 
Smith's  case  the  trial  court  instructed  that  if  a  juror  was 
convinced  the  correct  answer  to  each  special-issue  question 
was "yes," but nevertheless concluded the defendant did not 
deserve  death  in  light  of  all  the  mitigating  evidence,  the 
juror  must  answer  one  special-issue  question  "no."  The 
charge  was  not  incorporated  into  the  verdict  form.  See, 
e. g., 1 App. 123-124.  In essence the jury was instructed to 
misrepresent its answer to one of the two special issues when 
necessary to take account of the mitigating evidence. 

In  Penry  II,  the  Court  concluded  that  a  nullification 
charge created an ethical and logical dilemma that prevented 
jurors from giving effect to the mitigating evidence when the 
evidence was outside the scope of the special issues.  As the 
Court explained, "because the supplemental [nullification] in-
struction  had  no  practical  effect,  the  jury  instructions  .  .  . 
were not meaningfully different from the ones we found con-
stitutionally  inadequate  in  Penry  I."  532  U. S.,  at  798.  In 
other  words,  Penry  II  held  that  the  nullification  charge  did 
not cure the Penry error. 

Penry II and Smith I recognized the ethical dilemma, the 
confusion, and the capriciousness introduced into  jury delib-

Opinion of the Court 
erations  by  directing  the  jury  to  distort  the  meaning  of  an instruction and a verdict form.  Penry II, supra, at 797-802; 

Smith I, supra, at 45-48.  These are problems distinct from Penry error and may be grounds for reversal as an independ-
ent  matter;  but  we  need  not  reach  that  issue  here,  just  as the Court did not need to reach it in Penry II or Smith I. 

When  this  Court  reversed  the  Court  of  Criminal  Appeals in 

Smith I, it did so because the nullification charge had not cured  the  underlying  Penry  error.  See  Smith  I,  543  U. S., 

at 48 (holding that "the burden of proof . . . was  tied by law to  findings  of  deliberateness  and  future  dangerousness  that 
had  little,  if  anything,  to  do  with"  the  mitigating  evidence). While  the  ethical  and  logical  quandary  caused  by  the  jury 
nullification  charge  may  give  rise  to  distinct  error,  this  was not the basis for reversal in Smith I.  On remand the Court 
of Criminal Appeals misunderstood this point.  Its interpre-tation of federal law was incorrect. 

In light of our decision in Smith I, our review of the facts need  not  restate  the  brutality  of  the  murder  Smith  com-
mitted  or  the  evidence  he  offered  in  mitigation.  See  id.,  at 38-43.  We need only address the conclusion of the Court of 
Criminal  Appeals  that  the  constitutional  error  asserted  by Smith was caused by the nullification charge and that, having 
failed  to  alert  the  trial  court  to  that  error,  Smith  was  re-quired to demonstrate egregious harm to obtain relief. 

B 
The Trial 

Before  voir  dire,  Smith  filed  three  written  motions  ad-dressing  the  jury  instructions.  In  the  first,  he  argued  that 

Jurek v.  Texas, 428 U. S. 262 (1976), and Penry I established the constitutional inadequacy of the special issues.  The mo-
tion maintained that Texas law denied the trial court power to cure the problem because "[t]he exclusive methodology for 
submission to the jury of special issues with regard to inflic-tion  of  the  death  penalty  [is]  contained  in"  Article  37.071  of 

550US1 Unit: $U35 [07-22-10 14:36:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN

303 Cite as: 550 U. S. 297 (2007) 
Opinion of the Court 
the  Texas  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure  Annotated  (Vernon 2006 Supp. Pamphlet), which did not authorize the trial court 

to  add  an  additional  special  issue  on  mitigation.  1  App.  9. The  trial  court,  the  objection  stated,  would  not  be  able  to 
provide  "any  instruction  with  regard  to mitigating  evidence which  would  permit  the  jury  to  make  a  moral  reasoned  re-
sponse  to"  mitigating  evidence  not  covered  by  the  special issues. 

Ibid.  Smith would offer such evidence. The  second  pretrial  motion  raised  a  related  but  distinct 

argument.  Smith  began  by  noting  that  in  Jurek  the  Su-preme  Court  had  found  Article  37.071  constitutional  on  its 
face.  He argued, however, it did so with the understanding that  the  Texas  courts  would  give  broad  construction  to 
terms  in  the  special  issues  such  as  " `deliberately.' "  1  App. 12.  They  had  not  done  so  and  therefore  "[t]here  [was]  no 
provision in Texas for the jury to decide the appropriateness of  the  death  penalty  taking  into  consideration  the  personal 
moral  culpability  of  the  [d]efendant  balanced  by  mitigating evidence  which  is  not  directly  or  circumstantially  probative 
in  answering  the  special  issues."  Id.,  at  13.  Smith  there-fore reasoned that Article 37.071 was unconstitutional. 

The third pretrial motion asked the court to state the con-tents  of  the  mitigation  charge  prior  to 

voir  dire  so  Smith could  exercise  his  jury  challenges  intelligently.  Id.,  at 

17-19. The  trial  court  denied  the  first  two  motions.  Id.,  at  21. 
In response to the  third it  provided  Smith a  copy  of its pro-posed  mitigation  charge.  That  charge,  which  we  will  refer 
to  as  "the  nullification  charge,"  defined  mitigating  evidence broadly before explaining to the jury, in relevant part: 

"[I]f you believe that the State has proved beyond a rea-sonable doubt that the answers to the Special Issues are 
`Yes,' and you also believe from the mitigating evidence, if  any,  that  the  Defendant  should  not  be  sentenced  to 
death,  then  you  shall  answer  at  least  one  of  the  Special Issues `No' in order to give effect to your belief that the

Opinion of the Court 
death penalty should not be imposed due to the mitigat-
ing evidence  presented to you.  In  this  regard, you are 
further  instructed  that  the  State  of  Texas  must  prove 
beyond  a  reasonable  doubt  that  the  death  sentence 
should  be  imposed  despite  the  mitigating  evidence,  if 
any, admitted before you."  Smith I, supra, at 40 (inter-
nal quotation marks omitted). 

The nullification charge did not define or describe the spe-
cial issues.  1 App. 105-110.  The judge told counsel: "If you 
see  something  in  that  charge  that  you'd  like  worded  differ-
ently  or  you  think  could  be  made  clearer  or  better,  I'm  al-
ways willing to entertain different wording or different ways 
of  putting  the  idea.  So  if  you  come  up  with  something  you 
like  better,  just  let  me  know  and  I'll  look  at  it."  Id.,  at  21. 
Smith  raised  no  additional  objection  and  did  not  suggest  al-
ternative wording for the nullification charge. 

The  jury  received  the  nullification  charge  from  the  judge, 
but  the  verdict  form  did  not  incorporate  it.  The  form  was 
confined  to  the  special  issues  of  deliberateness  and  future 
dangerousness.  Id., at 123-124.  The jury unanimously an-
swered "yes" to both special-issue questions, and Smith was 
sentenced to death. 

C 

Post-Trial Proceedings 

The  State  does  not  contest  the  validity  of  Smith's  chal-
lenge  to  the  special  issues  in  his  pretrial  motion.  It  does 
contend  that  since  Smith  did  not  object  to  the  nullification 
charge,  his  state  habeas  petition  rests  on  an  unpreserved 
claim, namely, that the nullification charge excluded his miti-
gating  evidence.  The  State's  formulation  of  the  federal 
right claimed by Smith, a formulation accepted by the Court 
of Criminal Appeals, is based on an incorrect reading of fed-
eral  law  and  this  Court's  precedents.  Considering  Smith's 
first  two  pretrial  motions  together,  as  the  trial  court  did,  it

Opinion of the Court 
is evident Smith's objection was that the special-issue frame-work  violated  the  Eighth  Amendment  because  it  prevented 

the  court  from  formulating  jury  instructions  that  would  en-sure  adequate  consideration  of  his  mitigating  evidence. 
This  framework  failed  because  the  special  issues  were  too narrow,  the  trial  court  was  unable  to  promulgate  a  new 
catchall  special  issue,  and  the  Texas  courts  did  not  define 
"deliberately" in broad terms.  The State is correct that this was an objection based on 

Penry error, not one based on the 
confusion caused by the nullification instruction. A  review of  Smith's  post-trial proceedings  shows  that  the 

central  argument  of  his  habeas  petition,  and  the  basis  for this  Court's  decision  in 

Smith  I,  is  the  same  constitutional 
error asserted at trial.  1 

Direct Appeal 
On  direct  appeal  from  the  trial  court,  Smith  renewed  his 
argument that the special issues were unconstitutional: 

"[I]n [Penry I], the Supreme Court held that there was an Eighth Ame[n]dment violation where there was miti-

gating evidence not relevant to the special verdict ques-
tions,  or  that  had  relevance  to  the  defendant's  moral culpability  beyond  the  scope  of  the  special  verdict 

questions,  and  the  jury  instructions  would  have  pro-vided  the  jury  with  no  vehicle  for  expressing  its  rea-
soned moral response to that evidence. . . . . . 

"By  its  extremely  narrow  interpretation  of  the  re-quirements  of 

Penry,  this  Court  has  unconstitutionally 
narrowed the sentencer's discretion to consider relevant 
mitigating evidence . . . .  The special issues . . . do not 
in  reality  provide  a  vehicle  for  individualized  consider-
ation  of the  appropriateness  of  assessment  of  the  death 
penalty and [the article establishing them] is unconstitu-
tional as applied."  1 App. 133-134.

306  SMITH  v.  TEXAS 

Opinion of the Court 
Both the Court of Criminal Appeals, in its most recent opin-ion,  and  the  State,  in  its  brief  on  direct  appeal,  recognized 

Smith's  pretrial  motions  preserved  this  argument.  185 S. W. 3d, at 462, and n. 9 (holding Smith's direct-appeal argu-
ment that "the jury was unable to give effect to his mitigat-ing  evidence  in  answering  the  special  issues"  was  "based 
upon his pretrial motion"); Brief for Texas in No. 71,333 (Tex. Crim.  App.),  p.  62,  Record  674  ("[Smith]  reiterates  his  [pre-
trial]  claim  that  the  statute  is  unconstitutional  as  applied since  it  fails  to  provide  an  effective  vehicle  for  the  jury  to 
apply mitigating evidence"). In  its  opinion  affirming  the  sentence  on  direct  review  the 
Court  of  Criminal  Appeals  held  that  the  "instruction  com-plied  with 

Penry  and  provided  a  sufficient  vehicle  for  the jury  to  consider  any  mitigating  evidence  [Smith]  offered."

First and Second State Habeas 

In  1998,  Smith  sought  state  habeas  relief.  Under  state law  the  petition  was  untimely.  The  Court  of  Criminal  Ap-

peals,  over  a  dissent,  rejected  an  argument  that  neglect  by Smith's  counsel  merited  equitable  tolling.  Ex  parte  Smith, 
977 S. W. 2d 610 (1998) (en banc); see id., at 614 (Overstreet, J., dissenting).  Texas then amended its filing rules to allow 
the  exception  the  Court  of  Criminal  Appeals  had  declined to create.  The statutory change permitted Smith to file for 
habeas relief. Smith  filed  his  second  habeas  petition  before  this  Court's 
decision  in  Penry  II.  He  argued  once  more  that  the  spe-cial  issues  were  inadequate:  "In 

Penry  [I],  the  Supreme Court . . . held that the former Texas capital sentencing stat-

ute  did  not  provide  an  adequate  vehicle  for  expressing  its reasoned  moral  response  to  [mitigating]  evidence  in  render-
ing its sentencing decision."  Application for Writ of Habeas

Crim.  App.),  p.  191,  Record  193  (internal  quotation  marks omitted).  Smith acknowledged the trial court tried to solve 
the  problem  with  the  nullification  charge,  but  he  explained that  "[i]t  confounds  common  sense  to  suggest  jurors--who 
are sworn to tell the truth--would ever understand that they 
were  authorized  to  answer  [special-issue]  questions  falsely." 
Id., at 193, Record 195.  Smith continued: 

"Nothing  in  the  special  issues  themselves  linked  the 
`nullification' instruction to the specific questions asked; nothing  in  the  special  issues  themselves  authorized  the 

jury  to  consider  mitigating  evidence  when  answering 
the  questions;  nothing  in  the  special  issues  themselves authorized  the  jury  to  answer  the  questions  `no'  when 

the  truthful  answer  was  `yes';  in  short,  nothing  in  the special  issues  permitted  the  jury  to  apply  the  `nullifica-
tion' instruction."  Id., at 194, Record 196. 
Smith  conceded  he  had  not  objected  to  the  nullification 
charge  but  confirmed  that  he  had  challenged  the  special-
issues  statute  and  that  the  Court  of  Criminal  Appeals  had 
reached the merits of this claim on direct review. 

The  State,  relying  upon  a  procedural  bar  different  from 
and indeed contradictory to the one it now raises, responded 
that  "[t]his  claim  [was]  procedurally  barred  as  it  was  both 
raised  and decided  on  the merits  on  direct appeal."  1  App. 
156;  see  also  id.,  at  157  (describing  Smith's  position  as  an 
"identical  complaint"  and  an  "identical  argument"  to  his 
claim  on  direct  appeal).  The  State  contended,  in  the  alter-
native, that Smith's position was meritless because the nulli-
fication  charge  cured  any  problem  with  the  special  issues.

Appeal from the Denial of State Habeas Relief 

While  Smith's  appeal  from the  state  trial  court's denial  of 
his  second  habeas  petition  was  pending,  this  Court  decided 
Penry  II.  Smith  filed  a  brief  in  the  Court  of  Criminal  Ap-
peals  explaining  the  relevance  of  Penry  II  to  his  habeas 
claim.  He noted that the special-issue  questions  in his  case 
were  for  all  relevant  purposes  the  same  as  those  in  Penry 
II.  Applicant's  Brief  for  Submission  in  View  of  the  United 
States  Supreme  Court's  Opinion  in  Penry  v.  Johnson  in 
No. W91-22803-R, pp. 4-5.  He maintained the  nullification 
charges  were  also  indistinguishable,  id.,  at  5-6,  and  had  in 
Penry II been held insufficient "to cure the error created by 
the  Special  Issues,"  Applicant's  Brief  for  Submission,  at 
6-7.  Smith concluded by explaining that the procedural bar 
for  raising  an  issue  already  resolved  on  direct  review  did 
not  apply  "where  an  intervening  legal  decision  renders  a 
previously  rejected  claim  meritorious."  Id.,  at  12  (citing 
Ex parte Drake, 883 S. W. 2d 213, 215 (Tex. Crim. App. 1994) 
(en banc)).  (We note the Court of Criminal Appeals recently 
adopted this position.  See Ex parte Hood, 211 S. W. 3d 767, 
775-778 (2007).) 

The  Court  of  Criminal  Appeals  ordered  supplemental 
briefing  on  the  relevance  of  Penry  II.  Given  that  Penry  II 
addressed  the  sufficiency  of  a  nullification  charge  as  a  cure 
for inadequate special issues, Smith's supplemental brief con-
centrated  on  the  same  issue.  Nevertheless,  his  central  ar-
gument  remained  that  he  "presented  significant  mitigating 
evidence  that  was  virtually  indistinguishable  from  Penry's

Opinion of the Court 
and thus undeniably beyond the scope of the special issues." Applicant's  Supplemental  Briefing  on  Submission  in 

No.  74,228,  p.  12  (hereinafter  Applicant's  Supp.  Briefing). The nullification  charge was  inadequate  as well,  in  his view, 
because, based on the ethical dilemma, "there is a reasonable probability  that  the  nullification  instruction . . .  precluded 
[a  juror  who  found  that  Smith's  personal  culpability  did  not 
warrant a death sentence] from expressing that conclusion." 
Id., at 13.  Alternatively, Smith argued he was "also entitled 
to  relief  under  Penry  II"  because  "[e]ven  if  the  jury  might have been able to give effect to some of [his] mitigating evi-

dence  within  the  scope  of  [the]  special  issues,  the  confusing 
nullification instruction  itself " may  have  prevented the  jury 
from doing  so.  Id., at 14.  As such, the nullification charge 
was  "worse  than  no  instruction  at  all."  Id.,  at  15-16  (em-
phasis deleted). 

The State responded that the special issues were adequate 
and,  furthermore,  that  the  nullification  charge,  unlike  the 
charge  in  Penry  II,  cured  any  problem.  State's  Brief  in 
No.  74,228  (Tex.  Crim.  App.),  pp.  2-11.  In  response  to 
Smith's  second  argument  the  State  contended  "it  tests  the 
bounds of reason to grant [Smith] relief based on a good-faith 
attempt  to  give  him  a  supplemental  instruction  to  which  he 
was  not  constitutionally  entitled."  Id.,  at  11.  In  reply 
Smith  reiterated  his  two  distinct  arguments,  devoting  most 
of the brief to his original trial objection.  Applicant's Reply 
to  Respondent's  Response  to  Applicant's  Brief  for  Submis-
sion in No. 74,228 (Tex. Crim. App.). 

The  Court  of  Criminal  Appeals  denied  the  habeas  peti-
tion.  It  found  no  Penry  error,  reasoning  that  the  special 
issues  were  adequate  to  consider  the  mitigating  evidence. 
Ex  parte  Smith,  132  S.  W.  3d,  at  412-415.  Any  evidence 
excluded  from  the  purview  of  the  jury,  the  court  indicated, 
was not "constitutionally significant."  Id., at 413, n. 21.  In 
the alternative the court held the nullification charge and the 
argument at trial were distinguishable from those at issue in

Opinion of the Court 
Penry II.  In Smith's case, the court reasoned, the nullifica-tion  charge  would  have  been  an  adequate  cure  even  if  the 

special issues were too narrow.  132 S. W. 3d, at 416-417. The  majority  did  not  adopt  or  address  the  reasoning  of 
the  two  concurring  opinions,  which  argued  that  Smith  had procedurally defaulted his "Penry II claim" because while he 
had objected to the special issues at trial, he had not objected separately to the nullification charge.

Smith I 

The  ruling  of  the  Court  of  Criminal  Appeals  in  Smith's second  state  habeas  proceeding  was  reversed  by  this  Court 

in Smith I.  The  Court's  summary  disposition  first  rejected as unconstitutional the Texas court's screening test for "con-
stitutionally  significant"  evidence.  543  U. S.,  at  43-48;  see also 

Tennard v.  Dretke, 542 U. S. 274 (2004). The Smith I Court next observed that although Smith had 

presented  relevant  mitigating  evidence,  the  jury's  consider-ation  was  "tied  by  law  to  findings  of  deliberateness  and  fu-
ture  dangerousness  that  had  little,  if  anything,  to  do  with" that  evidence.  543  U. S.,  at  45,  48.  There  was,  in  other 
words, a Penry error.  As a final matter, despite differences between  the  nullification  charges  in  Smith  I  and  Penry  II, 
the  variances  were  "constitutionally  insignificant"  because "

Penry  II  identified  a  broad  and  intractable  problem."  543 U. S., at 46, 47 (citing Penry  II, 532 U. S., at 799-800).  The 

nullification  charge  was  therefore  inadequate  under  Penry II.  The  judgment  was  reversed  and  the  case  remanded. 
543 U. S., at 48-49.  5 

Remand Following Smith I 
On remand Smith's brief urged that harmless-error review 
was inappropriate because under the nullification charge the

Opinion of the Court 
jury  proceedings  became  capricious.  See  Applicant's  Brief 
on  Remand  in  No.  74,228  (Tex.  Crim.  App.),  pp.  8-18.  The 
State responded that Smith was procedurally barred because 
he waited to raise his allegation of "jury charge error" under 
Penry  II  until  the  second  state  habeas  petition  nine  years 
after his conviction.  State's Brief on Remand  in No.  74,228 
(Tex.  Crim.  App.),  pp.  1,  2  (hereinafter  State's  Brief  on  Re-
mand).  The  State  maintained this  was an  adequate and  in-
dependent  state  ground  for  denying  relief.  Ibid.  Smith's 
motion  and  direct  appeal,  the  State  said,  had  been  based  on 
a challenge to the statute setting forth the special issues, not 
to the jury charge.  Id., at 5-6.  The State  also maintained 
that this Court had not addressed whether the special issues 
were  "a  sufficient  vehicle  for  the  jury  to  give  effect  to 
[Smith's] mitigation evidence."  Id., at 12-16. 

Smith  replied  to  the  procedural-bar  argument  by  noting 
he  had  "consistently  raised  his  claim  regarding  the  inade-
quacy  of  the  special  issues  to  permit  constitutionally  ade-
quate consideration of his mitigating evidence and this Court 
has  consistently  addressed  the  merits  of  [that]  claim."  Ap-
plicant's  Reply  Brief  on  Remand  in  No.  74,228  (Tex.  Crim. 
App.), p. 1. 

The Court of Criminal Appeals denied relief.  The court's 
confusion  with  the  interplay  between  Penry  I  and  Penry  II 
is  evident  from  the  beginning.  Reasoning  that  "[t]he  Su-
preme  Court  did  not  address  our  conclusion  that  the  two 
special issues provided [Smith's] jury with a constitutionally 
sufficient  vehicle  to  give  effect  to  his  mitigating  evidence," 
185  S.  W.  3d,  at  463  (internal  quotation  marks  omitted),  the 
court again concluded that the special issues were adequate, 
id.,  at  464-467.  Nevertheless,  because  of  its  "uncertainty" 
regarding  this  Court's  Penry  II  jurisprudence,  the  Court  of 
Criminal  Appeals  went  on  to  "assume,  for  the  sake  of  argu-
ment,  that  at  least  some  of  [Smith's]  evidence  was  not  fully 
encompassed  by  the  two  special  issues"  and  that  "the  jury

Opinion of the Court 
charge  in  this  case  was  constitutionally  deficient  under Penry II."  185 S. W. 3d, at 467. 

The  Court  then  applied  the  framework  of  Almanza  v. State,  686  S.  W.  2d  157  (Tex.  Crim.  App.  1984)  (en  banc),  to 
Smith's claim of error.  Under Almanza, Smith needed first to  show  instructional  error.  Having  assumed  Smith  had 
done  so,  the  court  next  asked  whether  the  error  was  pre-served  for  review.  If  so,  Smith  would  need  to  establish 
some  "actual,"  not  merely  theoretical,  harm  resulting  from the  error.  If  Smith  had  not  preserved  the  error,  by  con-
trast, he would need  to establish not  merely some harm but also that the harm was egregious.  185 S. W. 3d, at 467. 

The  court  found  Smith  had  not  preserved  his  claim  of  in-structional  error.  Smith's  only  objection  at  trial,  reasoned 
the  state  court,  was  that  the  statute  authorizing  the  special issues  was  unconstitutional  in  light  of 

Penry  I.  185  S.  W. 3d,  at  461-462,  and  n.  8.  This  objection  did  not  preserve  a 

challenge  to  the  nullification  charge  based  on  Penry  II,  so Smith was required to show egregious harm.  That showing 
had  not  been  addressed  by  this  Court's  holding  in  Smith  I, the Court of Criminal Appeals indicated, because this Court 
only required that Smith demonstrate a reasonable probabil-ity  of  harm.  In  the  view  of  the  Court  of  Criminal  Appeals 
there was little likelihood that Smith's jury had failed to con-sider the mitigating evidence.  185 S. W. 3d, at 468-473.  On 
this basis the court concluded Smith had failed to show egre-gious harm and, as such, habeas relief was foreclosed. 

We granted certiorari.  549 U. S. 948 (2006). 

II 

A 

The  special  issues  through  which  Smith's  jury  sentenced him  to  death  did  not  meet  constitutional  standards,  as  held 

in  Penry  I;  and  the  nullification  charge  did  not  cure  that error,  as  held  in 

Penry  II.  This  was  confirmed  in  Smith  I. The  Court  of  Criminal  Appeals  on  remand  denied  relief,

Opinion of the Court 
nonetheless, based on two determinations: first, that Smith's federal  claim  was  not  preserved;  second,  as  a  result,  that 

Smith  was  required  by  Almanza  to  show  egregious  harm. As a general matter, and absent some important exceptions, 
when  a  state  court  denies  relief  because  a  party  failed  to comply  with  a  regularly  applied  and  well-established  state 
procedural  rule,  a  federal  court  will  not  consider  that  issue. 
Ford  v.  Georgia, 498 U. S. 411, 423-424 (1991). Smith  disputes  that  the  application  of 

Almanza  on  state 
habeas review is a "firmly established and regularly followed state  practice." 

James  v.  Kentucky,  466  U. S.  341,  348-349 
(1984).  The  State  argues  it  is.  We  may  assume  the  State 
is correct on this point, for in our view the predicate finding 
of procedural failure that led the Court of Criminal Appeals 
to apply the heightened Almanza standard is based on a mis-
interpretation of federal law. 

The  State  and  the  Court  of  Criminal  Appeals  read  Smith 
I  as  having  reversed  because  the  nullification  charge  "pre-
vented giving effect to [Smith's] mitigating evidence because 
it placed the jurors in an unconstitutional ethical quandary." 
Brief for Respondent 28.  It is true Smith's second state ha-
beas  petition  included  an  argument  that  the  nullification 
charge itself prevented the jury from considering his mitigat-
ing  evidence.  This,  however,  was  not  the  only,  or  even  the 
primary,  argument  he  presented  to  the  Court  of  Criminal 
Appeals and this Court.  As detailed above, Smith's central 
objection at each stage has been to the special issues. 

In Smith I, this Court agreed the special issues were inad-
equate  and  so  reversed  the  Court  of  Criminal  Appeals.  In 
challenging the special issues Smith did contend that the nul-
lification  charge  was  flawed.  This  Court  engaged  in  much 
the  same  analysis.  That  analysis  was  only  necessary,  how-
ever,  because  the  Court  of  Criminal  Appeals  had  twice  re-
jected  Smith's  claim  of  Penry  error  based  on  the  mistaken 
idea  that  "regardless  of  whether  [Smith's]  mitigating  evi-
dence  was  beyond  the  scope  of  the  two  statutory  special  is-

314  SMITH  v.  TEXAS 

Opinion of the Court 
sues,  the  judge's  extensive  supplemental  [nullification]  in-struction provided a sufficient vehicle for the jury to consider 

all  of  [Smith's]  mitigating  evidence."  Ex  parte  Smith,  132 S.  W.  3d,  at  410.  In  other  words,  Smith  argued,  and  this 
Court agreed, that the special issues prevented the jury from considering  his  mitigating  evidence;  and  the  nullification 
charge failed to cure  that error.  In its  opposition to certio-
rari in Smith I, the State understood that under Penry II it was  the  special  issues,  not  the  nullification  charge,  that  cre-

ated  the  error.  See  Brief  in  Opposition  in  Smith  v.  Texas, O. T. 2004, No. 04-5323, p.  17 ("In  essence,  the [nullification] 
instruction  did  not  create  new  error;  rather,  the  instruction 
simply failed to correct the error identified in Penry I"). 

The Court of Criminal Appeals' mistaken belief that Penry 
II, and by extension Smith I, rested on a separate error aris-
ing  from  the  nullification  charge  may  have  stemmed  from 
Smith's use of the term "Penry II error" in his supplemental 
brief and  from this  Court's citation to Penry  II, rather  than 
Penry I, in Smith I.  Applicant's Supp. Briefing 11.  Smith's 
labeling  of  the  claim  in  his  supplemental  brief,  however,  did 
not  change  its  substance.  See  Ex  parte  Caldwell,  58 S.  W. 
3d  127,  130  (Tex.  Crim.  App.  2000);  Rawlings  v.  State,  874 
S.  W.  2d  740,  742  (Tex.  App.  Fort  Worth  1994).  And  this 
Court's reference to Penry II, rather than Penry I, has been 
explained above.  As the parties' post-trial filings, the state 
courts' judgments, and this Court's decision in Smith I make 
clear,  Smith  challenged  the  special  issues  under  Penry  I  at 
trial and did not abandon or transform that claim during his 
lengthy post-trial proceedings. 

After  Smith  I,  the  State  argued  for  the  first  time  that 
Smith's pretrial motions, and his argument on direct appeal, 
raised  a  "statutory"  complaint  about  the  entire  Texas  death 
penalty  scheme  different  from  his  current  theory.  State's 
Brief on Remand 6.  The State expanded on that claim in its 
arguments to this Court, in which it suggested Smith made a 
strategic  decision  to  launch  a  broad  attack  on  the  state  sys-

Opinion of the Court 
tem  rather  than  attempt  to  obtain  adequate  instructions  in his  own  case.  Brief  for  Respondent  28,  32-33;  Tr.  of  Oral 

Arg.  40.  Regardless  of how  the  State  now  characterizes  it, Smith's claim was treated by the Court of Criminal Appeals 
as a Penry challenge to the adequacy of the special issues in his  case,  and  that  is  how  it  was  treated  by  this  Court  in 
Smith I. The  Court of  Criminal Appeals  on  remand  misunderstood 
the interplay of Penry I and Penry II, and it mistook which of Smith's claims furnished the basis for this Court's opinion 
in  Smith  I.  These  errors  of  federal  law  led  the  state  court to  conclude  Smith  had  not  preserved  at  trial  the  claim  this 
Court vindicated in Smith I, even when the Court of Crimi-nal Appeals previously had held Smith's claim of 

Penry error was preserved.  The state court's error of federal law cannot 

be  the  predicate  for  requiring  Smith  to  show  egregious harm.  Ake v.  Oklahoma, 470 U. S. 68, 75 (1985).

Under  Almanza,  once  Smith  established  the  existence  of instructional error that was preserved by a proper objection, 

he  needed  only  to  show  he  suffered  "some  harm"  from  that error.  In  other  words,  relief  should  be  granted  so  long  as 
the error was not harmless.  686 S. W. 2d, at 171.  It would appear this lower standard applies to Smith's preserved chal-
lenge to the special issues. The Court of Criminal Appeals explained in its recent de-
cision in  Penry  v.  State,  178  S. W.  3d  782  (2005),  that  once  a state  habeas  petitioner  establishes  "a  reasonable  likelihood 
that the jury believed that it was not permitted to consider" some  mitigating  evidence,  he  has  shown  that  the  error  was 
not  harmless  and  therefore  is  grounds  for  reversal.  Id.,  at 786-788  (citing 

Boyde  v.  California,  494  U. S.  370  (1990)). We  note  that  the  Court  of  Criminal  Appeals  stated  in  dicta 

in  this  case  that  even  assuming  Smith  had  established  that there was a reasonable probability of error, he had not shown

the  same  as  out-of-state  ones,  do  not  discriminate  against  interstate 
commerce.  Pp. 338-345. 

(a)  To  determine  whether  a  law  violates  the  dormant  Commerce 
Clause, the Court first asks whether it discriminates on its face against 
interstate  commerce.  In  this  context,  " `discrimination'  simply  means 
differential  treatment  of  in-state  and  out-of-state  economic  interests 
that  benefits  the  former  and  burdens  the  latter."  Oregon  Waste  Sys-
tems,  Inc.  v.  Department  of  Environmental  Quality  of  Ore.,  511  U. S. 
93, 99.  Discriminatory laws motivated by "simple economic protection-
ism"  are subject to a "virtually per se rule  of invalidity," Philadelphia 
v.  New  Jersey,  437  U. S.  617,  624,  which  can  only  be  overcome  by  a 
showing that there is no other means to advance a legitimate local pur-
pose, Maine v.  Taylor, 477 U. S. 131, 138.  Pp. 338-339. 

(b)  Carbone does not control this case.  Carbone involved a flow con-
trol ordinance requiring that all nonhazardous solid waste within a town 
be deposited, upon payment of an above-market tipping fee, at a transfer 
facility run by a private contractor under an agreement with the town. 
See 511 U. S., at 387.  The dissent there opined that the ostensibly pri-
vate  transfer  station  was  "essentially  a  municipal  facility,"  id.,  at  419, 
and that this distinction should have saved the ordinance because favor-
ing local government is different from favoring a particular private com-
pany.  The majority's failure to comment  on  the public-private  distinc-
tion  does  not  prove,  as  the  haulers'  contend,  that  the  majority  agreed 
with  the  dissent's  characterization  of  the  facility,  but  thought  there 
was  no  difference  under  the  dormant  Commerce  Clause  between  laws 
favoring  private  entities  and  those  favoring  public  ones.  Rather,  the 
Carbone  majority  avoided  the  issue  because  the  transfer  station  was 
private,  and  therefore  the  question  whether  public  facilities  may  be 
favored  was  not  properly  before  the  Court.  The  majority  viewed  the 
ordinance  as  "just  one  more  instance  of  local  processing  requirements 
that  we  long  have  held  invalid,"  id.,  at  391,  citing  six  local  processing 
cases  involving  discrimination  in  favor  of  private  enterprise.  If  the 
Court were extending this line of cases to cover discrimination in favor 
of  local  government,  it  could  be  expected  to  have  said  so.  Thus,  Car-
bone cannot be regarded as having decided the public-private question. 
Pp. 339-341. 

(c)  The flow control ordinances in this case do not discriminate against 
interstate  commerce.  Compelling  reasons  justify  treating  these  laws 
differently  from  laws  favoring  particular  private  businesses  over  their 
competitors.  "[A]ny  notion  of  discrimination  assumes  a  comparison  of 
substantially similar entities," General Motors Corp. v.  Tracy, 519 U. S. 
278, 298, whereas government's important responsibilities to protect the 
health, safety, and welfare of its citizens set it apart from a typical pri-

vate  business,  cf.  id.,  at  313.  Moreover,  in  contrast  to  laws  favoring 
in-state  business  over  out-of-state  competition,  which  are  often  the 
product of economic protectionism, laws favoring local government may 
be directed toward any number of legitimate goals unrelated to protec-
tionism.  Here, the ordinances enable the Counties to pursue particular 
policies with respect to waste  handling and treatment, while allocating 
the  costs  of  those  policies  on  citizens  and  businesses  according  to  the 
volume of waste they generate.  The contrary approach of treating pub-
lic  and  private  entities  the  same  under  the  dormant  Commerce  Clause 
would lead to unprecedented and unbounded interference by the courts 
with state and local government.  The Counties' citizens could have left 
the entire matter of waste management services for the private sector, 
in  which  case  any  regulation  they  undertook  could  not  discriminate 
against interstate commerce.  But it was also open to them to vest re-
sponsibility  for  the  matter  with  their  government,  and  to  adopt  flow 
control ordinances to support the government effort.  It is not the office 
of  the  Commerce  Clause  to  control  the  voters'  decision  in  this  regard. 
The  Court  is  particularly  hesitant  to  interfere  here  because waste  dis-
posal  is  typically  and  traditionally  a  function  of  local  government  ex-
ercising  its  police  power.  Nothing  in  the  Commerce  Clause  vests  the 
responsibility  for  such  a  policy  judgment  with  the  Federal  Judiciary. 
Finally,  while  the  Court's  dormant  Commerce  Clause  cases  often  find 
discrimination  when  the  burden  of  state  regulation  falls  on  interests 
outside the State, the most palpable harm imposed by the ordinances at 
issue--more  expensive  trash  removal--will  likely  fall  upon  the  very 
people who voted for the laws, the Counties' citizens.  There is no rea-
son to step in and hand local businesses a victory they could not obtain 
through the political process.  Pp. 342-345.

Opinion of the Court 
ents 4.  Many local landfills were operating without permits 
and in  violation of state regulations.  Sixteen  were ordered 
to close and remediate the surrounding environment, costing 
the  public  tens  of  millions  of  dollars.  These  environmental 
problems  culminated  in  a  federal  cleanup  action  against  a 
landfill in Oneida County; the defendants in that case named 
over  600  local  businesses  and  several  municipalities  and 
school districts as third-party defendants. 

The  "crisis"  extended  beyond  health  and  safety  concerns. 
The  Counties  had  an  uneasy  relationship  with  local  waste 
management  companies,  enduring  price  fixing,  pervasive 
overcharging,  and  the  influence  of  organized  crime.  Dra-
matic price hikes were not  uncommon: In 1986, for example, 
a  county  contractor  doubled  its  waste  disposal  rate  on  six 
weeks' notice. 

Responding to these problems, the Counties requested and 
New  York's  Legislature  and  Governor  created  the  OneidaHerkimer Solid Waste Management Authority (Authority), a 
public  benefit  corporation.  See  N.  Y.  Pub.  Auth.  Law  Ann. 

$ 2049-aa  et  seq.  (West 1995).  The  Authority  is  empowered 
to  collect,  process,  and  dispose  of  solid  waste  generated  in 
the Counties.  $ 2049-ee(4).  To further  the Authority's 
governmental and public purposes, the Counties may impose 
"appropriate  and  reasonable  limitations  on  competition" 
by,  for  instance,  adopting  "local  laws  requiring  that  all 
solid  waste  . . . be  delivered  to  a  specified  solid  waste 
management-resource recovery facility."  $ 2049-tt(3). 

In  1989,  the  Authority  and  the  Counties  entered  into  a 
Solid  Waste  Management  Agreement,  under  which  the  Au-
thority agreed to manage all solid waste within the Counties. 
Private  haulers  would  remain  free  to  pick  up  citizens'  trash 
from the  curb, but the  Authority  would take over the  job of 
processing  the  trash,  sorting  it,  and  sending  it  off  for  dis-
posal.  To fulfill its part of the bargain, the Authority agreed 
to  purchase  and  develop  facilities  for  the  processing  and

Opinion of the Court 

disposal  of  solid  waste  and  recyclables  generated  in  the Counties. 

The Authority collected "tipping fees" to cover its operat-ing  and  maintenance  costs  for  these  facilities.

1  The  tipping 

fees  significantly  exceeded  those  charged for  waste  removal on  the  open  market,  but  they  allowed  the  Authority  to  do 

more  than  the  average  private  waste  disposer.  In  addition to  landfill  transportation  and  solid  waste  disposal,  the  fees 
enabled  the  Authority  to  provide  recycling  of  33  kinds  of materials, as well as composting, household hazardous waste 
disposal, and a number of other services.  If the Authority's operating costs and debt service were not recouped through 
tipping fees and other charges, the agreement provided that the Counties would make up the difference. 

As described, the agreement had a flaw: Citizens might opt to  have  their  waste  hauled  to  facilities  with  lower  tipping 
fees.  To  avoid  being  stuck  with  the  bill  for  facilities  that citizens  voted  for  but  then  chose  not  to  use,  the  Counties 
enacted  "flow  control"  ordinances  requiring  that  all  solid waste generated within the Counties be delivered to the Au-
thority's  processing  sites.2  Private  haulers  must  obtain  a 

1 Tipping  fees  are  disposal  charges  levied  against  collectors  who  drop 
off waste at a processing facility.  They are called "tipping" fees because 
garbage trucks literally tip their back end to dump out the carried waste. 
As of 1995, haulers in the Counties had to pay tipping fees of at least $86 
per  ton, a  price  that ballooned  to  as much  as  $172 per  ton  if a  particular 
load contained more than 25% recyclables. 

2 Oneida's flow control ordinance provides in part: 

"From the time of placement of solid waste and of recyclables at the road-
side or other designated area approved by the County or by the Authority 
pursuant  to  contract  with  the  County,  or  by  a  person  for  collection  in 
accordance  herewith,  such  solid  waste  and  recyclables  shall  be  delivered 
to the appropriate facility, entity or person responsible for disposition des-
ignated by the County or by the Authority pursuant to contract with the 
Authority."  App. to Pet. for Cert. 122a. 

The  relevant  portion  of  Herkimer's  flow  control  ordinance  is  substan-
tially similar: 

"After placement of garbage and of recyclable materials at the roadside or 
other designated area approved by the Legislature by a person for collec-

Opinion of the Court 
permit  from  the  Authority  to  collect  waste  in  the  Counties. Penalties for noncompliance with the ordinances include per-

mit revocation, fines, and imprisonment. Petitioners  are  United  Haulers  Association,  Inc.,  a  trade 
association  made  up  of  solid  waste  management  companies, and six haulers that operated in Oneida and Herkimer Coun-
ties when this action was filed.  In 1995, they sued the Coun-ties and the Authority under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, alleging that 
the  flow  control  laws  violate  the  Commerce  Clause  by  dis-criminating  against  interstate  commerce.  They  submitted 
evidence  that  without  the  flow  control  laws  and  the  associ-ated  $86-per-ton  tipping  fees,  they  could  dispose  of  solid 
waste  at  out-of-state  facilities  for  between  $37  and  $55  per ton, including transportation. 

The District Court read our decision in Carbone, 511 U. S. 383,  as  categorically  rejecting  nearly  all  flow  control  laws. 
The court ruled in the haulers' favor, enjoining enforcement of the Counties' laws.  The Second Circuit reversed, reason-
ing  that  Carbone  and  our  other  dormant  Commerce  Clause precedents  allow  for  a  distinction between  laws  that  benefit 
public  as  opposed  to  private  facilities.  261  F.  3d  245,  263 (2001).  Accordingly, it held that a statute does not discrimi-
nate  against  interstate  commerce  when  it  favors  local  gov-ernment  at  the  expense  of  all  private  industry.  The  court 
remanded to let the District Court decide whether the Coun-ties'  ordinances nevertheless  placed  an  incidental  burden  on 
interstate commerce, and if so, whether the ordinances' bene-fits outweighed that burden. 

On  remand  and  after  protracted  discovery,  a  Magistrate Judge  and  the  District Court  found that  the  haulers  did  not 
show that the ordinances imposed any cognizable burden on interstate  commerce.  The  Second  Circuit  affirmed,  assum-
ing  that the  laws  exacted  some  toll  on  interstate  commerce, but  finding  any  possible  burden  "modest"  compared  to  the 

tion in accordance herewith, such garbage and recyclable material shall be 
delivered to the appropriate facility designated by the Legislature, or by 
the Authority pursuant to contract with the County."  Id., at 135a.

The Commerce Clause provides that "Congress shall have Power . . . [t]o regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and 

among  the  several  States."  U. S.  Const.,  Art.  I,  $ 8,  cl.  3. Although the Constitution does not in terms limit the power 
of  States  to  regulate  commerce,  we  have  long  interpreted the  Commerce  Clause  as  an  implicit  restraint  on  state  au-
thority,  even  in  the  absence  of  a  conflicting  federal  statute. See 

Case  of  the  State  Freight  Tax,  15  Wall.  232,  279  (1873); Cooley  v.  Board  of  Wardens  of  Port  of  Philadelphia  ex  rel. 

Soc. for Relief of Distressed Pilots,  12 How. 299, 318 (1852). To  determine  whether  a  law  violates  this  so-called  "dor-
mant" aspect of the Commerce Clause, we first ask  whether it  discriminates  on  its  face  against  interstate  commerce.

other means to advance a legitimate local purpose, Maine v. Taylor, 477 U. S. 131, 138 (1986). 

B 
Following the lead of the Sixth Circuit in Daviess County, the  haulers  argue  vigorously  that  the  Counties'  ordinances 

discriminate  against  interstate  commerce  under  Carbone. In Carbone, the town of Clarkstown, New York, hired a pri-
vate contractor to build a waste transfer station.  According to  the  terms  of  the  deal,  the  contractor  would  operate  the 
facility  for  five  years,  charging  an  above-market  tipping  fee of $81 per ton; after five years, the town would buy the facil-
ity  for  one  dollar.  The  town  guaranteed  that  the  facility would receive a certain volume  of trash per year.  To make 
good  on  its  promise,  Clarkstown  passed  a  flow  control  ordi-nance requiring that all nonhazardous solid waste within the 
town  be  deposited  at  the  transfer  facility.  See  511  U. S., at 387. 

This Court struck down the ordinance, holding that it dis-criminated against interstate commerce by "hoard[ing] solid 
waste,  and  the  demand  to  get  rid  of  it,  for  the  benefit  of the  preferred processing  facility." 

Id.,  at 392.  The dissent pointed out  that  all of this  Court's local processing cases in-

volved  laws  that  discriminated  in  favor  of  private  entities, not public ones.

those favoring public ones.  The Counties disagree, arguing that  the  majority  studiously  avoided  the  issue  because  the 

facility  in  Carbone  was  private,  and  therefore  the  question whether  public  facilities  may  be  favored  was  not  properly 
before the Court.3 We believe the latter interpretation of Carbone is correct. 
As  the  Second  Circuit  explained,  "in  Carbone  the  Justices were  divided  over  the 

fact  of  whether  the  favored  facility was public or private,  rather than  on the import of that dis-

tinction."  261  F.  3d,  at  259  (emphasis  in  original).  The Carbone dissent offered a number of reasons why public enti-
ties  should  be  treated  differently  from  private  ones  under the  dormant  Commerce  Clause.  See  511  U. S.,  at  419-422

Opinion of the Court 
Court's  own  description  of  the  cases  acknowledges  that  the "offending  local  laws  hoard  a  local  resource--be  it  meat, 

shrimp, or milk--for the benefit of local businesses that treat it."  Id.,  at  392  (emphasis  added).  If  the  Court  were  ex-
tending  this  line  of  local  processing  cases  to  cover  discrimi-nation  in  favor  of  local  government,  one  would  expect  it  to 
have  said  so.  Cf.  United  States  v.  Burr,  25  F.  Cas.  55,  165 (No.  14,693)  (CC  Va.  1807)  (Marshall,  C.  J.)  ("[A]n  opinion 
which  is  to . . . establish  a principle never before recognized, should be expressed in plain and explicit terms"). 

The  Carbone  majority  stated  that  "[t]he  only  conceivable 
distinction"  between  the  laws  in  the  local  processing  cases and  Clarkstown's  flow  control  ordinance  was  that  Clarks-

town's ordinance favored a single local business, rather than a group of them.  511 U. S., at 392 (emphasis added).  If the 
Court  thought  Clarkstown's  processing  facility  was  public, that  additional  distinction  was  not  merely  "conceivable"--it 
was  conceived,  and  discussed  at  length,  by  three  Justices  in dissent. 

Carbone cannot be regarded as having decided the public-private question.

distinguishable on the same ground.

SOLID  WASTE  MANAGEMENT  AUTHORITY 

Opinion of the Court 

C 
The  flow  control  ordinances  in  this  case  benefit  a  clearly public  facility,  while  treating  all  private  companies  exactly 

the  same.  Because  the  question  is  now  squarely  presented on  the  facts  of  the  case  before  us,  we  decide  that  such  flow 
control  ordinances  do  not  discriminate  against  interstate commerce for purposes of the dormant Commerce Clause. 

Compelling reasons  justify  treating  these laws  differently from  laws  favoring  particular  private  businesses  over  their 
competitors.  "Conceptually,  of  course,  any  notion  of  dis-crimination  assumes  a  comparison  of  substantially  similar 
entities."  General Motors Corp. v.  Tracy, 519 U. S. 278, 298 (1997) (footnote omitted).  But States and municipalities are 
not  private  businesses--far  from  it.  Unlike  private  enter-prise,  government  is  vested  with  the  responsibility  of  pro-
tecting  the  health,  safety,  and  welfare  of  its  citizens.  See Metropolitan  Life  Ins.  Co.  v.  Massachusetts,  471  U. S.  724, 
756 (1985) ("The States traditionally have had great latitude under their police powers to legislate as to the protection of 

port  the  proposition.  Scott  struck  down  two  laws  that  discriminated  in 
favor  of  in-state  businesses  and  against  out-of-state  businesses;  neither 
law favored local government at the expense of all private industry.  See 
165 U. S., at 92-93, 101; Granholm v.  Heald, 544 U. S. 460, 478-479 (2005) 
(describing  Scott  holding).  Scott  is  simply  another  case  like  those  cited 
in footnote 4. 

Vance actually upheld "South Carolina's monopoly over liquor distribu-
tion[,] . . . reject[ing] the  argument that this monopoly system was uncon-
stitutionally  discriminatory."  Granholm,  supra,  at  507  (Thomas,

Opinion of the Court 

have  left  the  entire  matter  for  the  private  sector,  in  which 
case  any  regulation  they  undertook  could  not  discriminate 
against  interstate  commerce.  But  it  was  also  open  to them 
to vest responsibility  for the  matter with  their  government, 
and  to  adopt  flow  control  ordinances  to  support  the  govern-
ment  effort.  It is  not  the  office of  the Commerce  Clause to 
control the decision of the voters on whether government or 
the  private  sector  should  provide  waste  management  serv-
ices.  "The  Commerce Clause significantly  limits the  ability 
of  States  and  localities  to  regulate  or  otherwise  burden  the 
flow  of  interstate  commerce,  but  it  does  not  elevate  free 
trade  above  all  other  values."  Maine  v.  Taylor,  477  U. S., 
at  151.  See  Exxon  Corp.  v.  Governor  of  Maryland,  437 
U. S. 117, 127 (1978) (Commerce Clause does not protect "the 
particular  structure  or  methods  of  operation"  of  a  market). 

We  should  be  particularly  hesitant  to  interfere  with  the 
Counties'  efforts  under  the  guise  of  the  Commerce  Clause 
because  "[w]aste  disposal  is  both  typically  and  traditionally 
a local government function."  261 F. 3d, at 264 (case below) 
(Calabresi, J., concurring); see USA Recycling, Inc. v.  Baby-
lon, 66 F. 3d 1272, 1275 (CA2 1995) ("For ninety years, it has 
been  settled  law  that  garbage  collection  and  disposal  is  a 
core  function  of  local  government  in  the  United  States"); 
M.  Melosi,  Garbage  in  the  Cities:  Refuse,  Reform,  and  the 
Environment,  1880-1980,  pp.  153-155  (1981).  Congress  it-
self  has  recognized  local  government's  vital  role  in  waste 
management,  making  clear  that  "collection  and  disposal  of 
solid  wastes  should  continue  to  be  primarily  the  function  of 
State, regional, and local agencies."  Resource Conservation 
and  Recovery  Act  of  1976,  90  Stat.  2797,  42  U. S. C. 

$ 6901(a)(4).  The  policy  of  the  State  of  New  York  favors 
"displac[ing] competition with regulation or monopoly public 
control"  in  this  area.  N.  Y.  Pub.  Auth.  Law  Ann.  $ 2049- 
tt(3).  We  may  or  may  not  agree  with  that  approach,  but

nothing in the Commerce Clause vests the responsibility for that policy judgment with the Federal Judiciary.

Finally,  it  bears  mentioning  that  the  most  palpable  harm imposed by the ordinances--more expensive trash removal-- 

is likely to fall upon the very people who voted for the laws. Our  dormant  Commerce  Clause  cases  often  find  discrimina-
tion  when  a  State  shifts  the  costs  of  regulation  to  other States,  because  when  "the  burden  of  state  regulation  falls 
on  interests  outside  the  state,  it  is  unlikely  to  be  alleviated by  the  operation  of  those  political  restraints  normally  ex-
erted when interests within the state are affected."  South-
ern Pacific Co.  v.  Arizona  ex  rel.  Sullivan,  325  U. S.  761, 767-768, n. 2 (1945).  Here, the citizens and businesses of the 

Counties bear  the  costs  of the  ordinances.  There  is no  rea-son to step in and hand local businesses a victory they could 
not obtain through the political process. We  hold  that  the  Counties'  flow  control  ordinances,  which 
treat in-state  private business interests exactly  the same as out-of-state  ones,  do  not  "discriminate  against  interstate 
commerce"  for  purposes  of  the  dormant  Commerce  Clause.7

SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT AUTHORITY 

Opinion of Roberts, C. J.  

D 
The  Counties'  flow  control  ordinances  are  properly  ana-lyzed under the test set forth in 

Pike v.  Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U. S. 137, 142 (1970), which is reserved for laws "directed 

to  legitimate  local  concerns,  with  effects  upon  interstate commerce  that  are  only  incidental."  Philadelphia  v.  New 
Jersey,  437  U. S.,  at  624.  Under  the  Pike  test,  we  will  up-hold  a  nondiscriminatory  statute  like  this  one  "unless  the 
burden imposed on [interstate] commerce is clearly excessive in  relation to the putative local benefits."  397  U. S., at 142; 
Northwest  Central  Pipeline  Corp.  v.  State  Corporation 
Comm'n of Kan., 489 U. S. 493, 525-526 (1989). After  years  of  discovery,  both  the  Magistrate  Judge  and 

the  District Court could not  detect  any disparate impact  on out-of-state  as  opposed  to  in-state  businesses.  The  Second 
Circuit  alluded  to,  but  did  not  endorse,  a  "rather  abstract harm" that may exist because "the Counties' flow control or-
dinances  have  removed  the  waste  generated  in  Oneida  and Herkimer  Counties from  the national marketplace for  waste 
processing services."  438 F. 3d, at 160.  We find it unneces-sary to decide whether the ordinances impose any incidental 
burden on interstate commerce because any arguable burden does not exceed the public benefits of the ordinances. 

The  ordinances  give  the  Counties  a  convenient  and  ef-fective  way  to  finance  their  integrated  package  of  waste 
disposal  services.  While  "revenue  generation  is  not  a  local interest  that  can  justify 

discrimination  against  interstate commerce,"  Carbone,  511  U. S.,  at  393  (emphasis  added),  we 

think it is a cognizable benefit for purposes of the Pike test. At  the same  time, the  ordinances are  more than  financing 
tools.  They increase recycling in at least two ways, confer-
a  prescription  for  state  control  of  the  economy.  In  any  event,  Congress 
retains authority under the Commerce Clause as written to regulate inter-
state commerce, whether engaged in by private or public entities.  It can 
use  this  power,  as  it  has  in  the  past,  to  limit  state  use  of  exclusive  fran-
chises.  See, e. g., Gibbons v.  Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 221 (1824).

Opinion of Roberts, C. J.  
ring  significant  health  and  environmental  benefits  upon  the citizens  of  the  Counties.  First,  they  create  enhanced  in-

centives  for  recycling  and  proper  disposal  of  other  kinds of  waste.  Solid  waste  disposal  is  expensive  in  OneidaHerkimer,  but  the  Counties  accept  recyclables  and  many forms  of  hazardous  waste  for  free,  effectively  encouraging 
their  citizens to sort their  own  trash.  Second, by requiring all waste to be deposited at Authority facilities, the Counties 
have  markedly  increased  their  ability  to  enforce  recycling laws.  If  the  haulers  could  take  waste  to  any  disposal  site, 
achieving an equal level of enforcement would be much more costly,  if  not  impossible.  For  these  reasons,  any  arguable 
burden  the  ordinances  impose  on  interstate  commerce  does not exceed their public benefits. 

* * * 
The Counties' ordinances are exercises of the police power in  an  effort  to  address  waste  disposal,  a  typical  and  tradi-

tional  concern  of  local  government.  The  haulers  neverthe-less  ask  us  to  hold  that  laws  favoring  public  entities  while 
treating  all  private  businesses  the  same  are  subject  to  an almost 

per se rule of invalidity, because of asserted discrimi-nation.  In the alternative, they maintain that the Counties' 

laws  cannot survive  the  more permissive  Pike test,  because of  asserted  burdens  on  commerce.  There  is  a  common 
thread  to  these  arguments:  They  are  invitations  to  rigor-ously  scrutinize  economic  legislation  passed  under  the  aus-
pices of the police power.  There was a time when this Court presumed to make such binding judgments for society, under 
the  guise  of  interpreting  the  Due  Process  Clause.  See 
Lochner  v.  New  York,  198  U. S.  45  (1905).  We  should  not seek to reclaim that ground for judicial supremacy under the 

banner of the dormant Commerce Clause. The  judgments  of  the  United  States  Court  of  Appeals  for 
the Second Circuit are affirmed. 

It is so ordered.

is  in  most  portions  a  two-lane  road,  at  speeds  exceeding  85 miles  per  hour.  The  deputy  radioed  his  dispatch  to  report 

that  he  was  pursuing  a  fleeing  vehicle,  and  broadcast  its  li-cense  plate  number.  Petitioner,  Deputy  Timothy  Scott, 
heard  the  radio  communication  and  joined  the  pursuit  along with  other  officers.  In  the  midst  of  the  chase,  respondent 
pulled  into  the  parking  lot  of  a  shopping  center  and  was 
nearly boxed in by the various police vehicles.  Respondent evaded  the  trap  by  making  a  sharp  turn,  colliding  with 

Scott's  police  car,  exiting  the  parking  lot,  and  speeding  off once again down a two-lane highway. 

Following respondent's shopping center maneuvering, which  resulted  in  slight  damage  to  Scott's  police  car,  Scott 
took  over  as  the  lead  pursuit  vehicle.  Six  minutes  and nearly  10  miles  after  the  chase  had  begun,  Scott  decided  to 
attempt  to terminate  the  episode by  employing a  "Precision Intervention  Technique  (`PIT')  maneuver,  which  causes  the

Judging the matter on that basis, we think it is quite clear that  Deputy  Scott  did  not  violate  the  Fourth  Amendment. 

Scott  does  not  contest  that  his  decision  to  terminate  the car  chase  by  ramming  his  bumper  into  respondent's  vehicle 
constituted  a  "seizure."  "[A]  Fourth  Amendment  seizure [occurs]  .  .  .  when  there  is  a  governmental  termination  of

Syllabus 
After  petitioner  KSR  developed  an  adjustable  pedal  system  for  cars 
with cable-actuated throttles and obtained its '986 patent for the design, 
General  Motors  Corporation  (GMC)  chose  KSR  to  supply  adjustable 
pedal systems for trucks using computer-controlled throttles.  To make 
the '986 pedal compatible with the trucks, KSR added a modular sensor 
to its design.  Respondents (Teleflex) hold the exclusive license for the 
Engelgau patent,  claim  4 of  which discloses  a  position-adjustable pedal 
assembly  with  an  electronic  pedal  position  sensor  attached  to  a  fixed 
pivot  point.  Despite  having  denied  a  similar,  broader  claim,  the  U. S. 
Patent  and  Trademark  Office  (PTO)  had  allowed  claim  4  because  it  in-
cluded  the  limitation  of  a  fixed  pivot  position,  which  distinguished  the 
design from Redding's.  Asano was neither included among the Engel-
gau patent's prior art references nor mentioned in the patent's prosecu-
tion, and the PTO did not have before it an adjustable pedal with a fixed 
pivot point.  After learning of KSR's design for GMC, Teleflex sued for 
infringement, asserting that KSR's pedal system infringed the Engelgau 
patent's claim 4.  KSR countered that claim 4 was invalid under $ 103 of 
the Patent Act, which forbids issuance of a patent when "the differences 
between the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art are 
such  that  the  subject  matter  as  a  whole  would  have  been  obvious  at 
the  time  the  invention  was  made  to  a  person  having  ordinary  skill  in 
the art."

ordinary  skill  and  common  sense.  Finally,  the  court  drew  the  wrong 
conclusion from the risk of courts and patent examiners falling prey to 
hindsight bias.  Rigid preventative rules that deny recourse to common 
sense are neither necessary under, nor consistent with, this Court's case 
law.  Pp. 419-422. 

2.  Application  of  the  foregoing  standards  demonstrates  that  claim  4 
is obvious.  Pp. 422-426. 

(a)  The  Court  rejects  Teleflex's  argument  that  the  Asano  pivot 
mechanism's design prevents its combination with a sensor in the man-
ner  claim  4  describes.  This  argument  was  not  raised  before  the  Dis-
trict  Court,  and  it  is  unclear  whether  it  was  raised  before  the  Federal 
Circuit.  Given the significance of the District Court's finding that com-
bining  Asano  with  a  pivot-mounted  pedal  position  sensor  fell  within 
claim  4's  scope,  it  is  apparent  that  Teleflex  would  have  made  clearer 
challenges  if  it  intended  to  preserve  this  claim.  Its  failure  to  clearly 
raise  the  argument,  and  the  appeals  court's  silence  on  the  issue,  lead 
this Court to accept the District Court's conclusion.  Pp. 422-424. 

(b)  The District Court correctly concluded that when Engelgau de-
signed the claim 4 subject matter, it was obvious to a person of ordinary 
skill  in  the  art  to  combine  Asano  with  a  pivot-mounted  pedal  position 
sensor.  There  then  was  a  marketplace  creating  a  strong  incentive  to 
convert mechanical pedals to electronic pedals, and the prior art taught 
a number of methods for doing so.  The Federal Circuit considered the 
issue too narrowly by, in effect, asking whether a pedal designer writing 
on  a  blank  slate  would  have  chosen  both  Asano  and  a  modular  sensor 
similar  to  the  ones  used  in  the  Chevrolet  trucks  and  disclosed  in  the 
'068 patent.  The proper question was whether a pedal designer of ordi-
nary skill in the art, facing the wide range of needs created by develop-
ments  in  the  field,  would  have  seen  an  obvious  benefit  to  upgrading 
Asano  with  a  sensor.  For  such  a  designer  starting  with  Asano,  the 
question  was  where  to  attach  the  sensor.  The  '936  patent  taught  the 
utility  of  putting  the  sensor  on  the  pedal  device.  Smith,  in  turn,  ex-
plained  not  to  put  the  sensor  on  the  pedal  footpad,  but  instead  on  the 
structure.  And from Rixon's known wire-chafing problems, and Smith's 
teaching  that  the  pedal  assemblies  must  not  precipitate  any  motion  in 
the connecting wires, the designer would know to place the sensor on a 
nonmoving part of the pedal structure.  The most obvious such point is 
a pivot point.  The designer, accordingly, would follow Smith in mount-
ing the sensor there.  Just as it was possible to begin with the objective 
to  upgrade  Asano  to  work  with  a  computer-controlled  throttle,  so  too 
was  it  possible  to  take  an  adjustable  electronic  pedal  like  Rixon  and 
seek an improvement that would avoid the wire-chafing problem.  Tel-
eflex has not shown anything in the prior art that taught away from the

While the sequence of these questions might be reordered in any particular case, the factors continue to define the inquiry 

that  controls.  If  a  court,  or  patent  examiner,  conducts  this analysis and concludes the claimed subject matter was obvi-
ous, the claim is invalid under $ 103. Seeking  to  resolve  the question  of obviousness  with  more 
uniformity  and  consistency,  the  Court  of  Appeals  for  the Federal Circuit has employed an approach referred to by the 
parties  as  the  "teaching,  suggestion,  or  motivation"  test (TSM  test), under  which a  patent  claim is  only proved  obvi-
ous  if  "some  motivation  or  suggestion  to  combine  the  prior art  teachings"  can  be  found  in  the  prior  art,  the  nature  of 
the  problem,  or  the  knowledge  of  a  person  having  ordinary skill  in  the  art.  See,

throttles.  These  inventions,  such  as  the  device  disclosed  in U. S.  Patent  No.  5,241,936  (filed  Sept.  9,  1991)  ('936),  taught 

that  it  was  preferable  to  detect  the  pedal's  position  in  the pedal assembly, not in the engine.  The '936 patent disclosed 
a pedal with an electronic sensor on a pivot point in the pedal assembly.  U.  S.  Patent  No.  5,063,811  (filed  July  9,  1990) 
(Smith) taught that to prevent the wires connecting the sen-sor  to  the  computer  from  chafing  and  wearing  out,  and  to 
avoid  grime  and  damage  from  the  driver's  foot,  the  sensor should  be  put  on  a  fixed  part  of  the  pedal  assembly  rather 
than in or on the pedal's footpad. In  addition  to  patents  for  pedals  with  integrated  sensors 
inventors  obtained  patents  for  self-contained  modular  sen-sors.  A  modular  sensor  is  designed  independently  of  a 
given pedal so that it can be taken off the shelf and attached to mechanical pedals of various sorts, enabling the pedals to 
be  used  in  automobiles  with  computer-controlled  throttles. One  such  sensor  was  disclosed  in  U. S.  Patent  No.  5,385,068 
(filed Dec. 18, 1992) ('068).  In 1994, Chevrolet manufactured a line of trucks using modular sensors "attached to the pedal 
assembly support bracket, adjacent to the pedal and engaged with the pivot shaft about  which the pedal rotates in opera-
tion."  298 F. Supp. 2d 581, 589 (ED Mich. 2003). The  prior  art  contained  patents  involving  the  placement 
of  sensors  on  adjustable  pedals  as  well.  For  example,  U. S. Patent  No.  5,819,593  (filed  Aug.  17,  1995)  (Rixon)  discloses 
an  adjustable  pedal  assembly  with  an  electronic  sensor  for detecting  the  pedal's  position.  In  the  Rixon  pedal  the  sen-
sor  is  located  in  the  pedal  footpad.  The  Rixon  pedal  was known  to  suffer  from  wire  chafing  when  the  pedal  was  de-
pressed and released. This short account of pedal and sensor technology leads to 
the instant case.  B

vehicles.' "  298  F.  Supp.  2d,  at  590.  The  court  then  set forth  the relevant prior  art,  including the  patents and pedal 

designs described above. Following 

Graham's direction, the court compared the 
teachings  of  the  prior  art  to  the  claims  of  Engelgau.  It found  "little  difference."  298  F.  Supp.  2d,  at  590.  Asano 

taught  everything  contained  in  claim  4  except  the  use  of  a 
sensor  to  detect  the  pedal's  position  and  transmit  it  to  the computer  controlling  the  throttle.  That  additional  aspect 

was revealed in sources such as the '068 patent and the sen-sors used by Chevrolet. 

Under the controlling cases from the Court of Appeals for 
the Federal Circuit, however, the District Court was not per-
mitted  to  stop  there.  The  court  was  required  also  to  apply 
the  TSM  test.  The  District  Court  held  KSR  had  satisfied 
the  test.  It  reasoned  (1)  the  state  of  the  industry  would 
lead inevitably to combinations of electronic sensors and ad-
justable pedals, (2) Rixon provided the basis for these devel-
opments, and (3) Smith taught a solution to the wire-chafing 
problems  in  Rixon,  namely,  locating  the  sensor  on  the  fixed 
structure  of  the  pedal.  This  could  lead  to  the  combination 
of Asano, or a pedal like it, with a pedal position sensor. 

The conclusion that the Engelgau design was obvious was 
supported,  in  the  District  Court's  view,  by  the  PTO's  rejec-
tion  of  the  broader  version  of  claim  4.  Had  Engelgau  in-
cluded Asano in his patent application, it reasoned, the PTO 
would  have  found  claim  4  to  be  an  obvious  combination  of 
Asano  and  Smith,  as  it  had  found  the  broader  version  an 
obvious combination of Redding and Smith.  As a final mat-
ter, the District Court held that the secondary factor of Tel-
eflex's  commercial  success  with  pedals  based  on  Engelgau's 
design  did  not  alter  its  conclusion.  The  District  Court 
granted summary judgment for KSR. 

With principal reliance on the TSM test, the Court of Ap-
peals  reversed.  It  ruled  the  District  Court  had  not  been 
strict  enough  in  applying  the  test,  having  failed  to  make

have done had the Engelgau patent menti oned  Asano. 
Rather,  the  court  held,  the  District  Court  was  obliged  first 
to presume that the issued patent was valid and then to ren-
der  its  own  independent  judgment  of  obviousness  based  on 
a  review  of  the  prior  art.  The  fact  that  the  PTO  had  re-
jected  the  broader  version  of  claim  4,  the  Court  of  Appeals 
said, had no place in that analysis. 

The  Court  of  Appeals  further  held  that  genuine  issues  of 
material  fact  precluded  summary  judgment.  Teleflex  had 
proffered  statements  from  one  expert  that  claim  4  " `was  a 
simple, elegant, and novel combination of features,' " 119 Fed. 
Appx.,  at  290,  compared  to  Rixon,  and  from  another  expert 
that  claim  4  was  nonobvious  because,  unlike  in  Rixon,  the 
sensor was  mounted  on  the support bracket  rather  than the 
pedal  itself.  This  evidence,  the  court  concluded,  sufficed  to 
require a trial.

Appeals.  Throughout  this  Court's  engagement  with  the 
question  of  obviousness,  our  cases  have  set  forth  an  expan-

will  be  combinations  of  what,  in  some  sense,  is  already known. 

Helpful insights, however, need not become rigid and man-datory  formulas;  and  when  it  is  so  applied,  the  TSM  test  is 
incompatible  with  our  precedents.  The  obviousness  analy-sis  cannot  be  confined  by  a  formalistic  conception  of  the 
words  teaching,  suggestion,  and  motivation,  or  by  overem-phasis  on  the  importance  of  published  articles  and  the  ex-
plicit  content  of  issued  patents.  The  diversity  of  inventive pursuits and of modern technology counsels against  limiting 
the analysis in this way.  In many fields it may be that there is little discussion of obvious techniques or combinations, and 
it  often  may  be  the  case  that  market  demand,  rather  than scientific literature, will drive design trends.  Granting pat-
ent  protection  to  advances  that  would  occur  in  the  ordinary course without real  innovation retards  progress and may, in 
the  case  of  patents  combining  previously  known  elements, deprive prior inventions of their value or utility. 

In  the  years  since  the  Court  of  Customs  and  Patent  Ap-peals  set  forth  the  essence  of  the  TSM  test,  the  Court  of 
Appeals  no  doubt  has  applied  the  test  in  accord  with  these principles  in  many  cases.  There  is  no  necessary  inconsist-
ency between the idea underlying the TSM test and the Gra-ham

The same constricted analysis led the Court of Appeals to conclude,  in  error,  that  a  patent  claim  cannot  be  proved  ob-

Opinion of the Court 
a  fixed  pivot  point.  The  prior  art  discussed  above  leads  us to the conclusion that attaching the sensor where both KSR 

and Engelgau put it would have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill. 

The '936 patent taught the utility of putting the sensor on the  pedal  device,  not  in  the  engine.  Smith,  in  turn,  ex-
plained  to  put  the  sensor  not  on  the  pedal's  footpad  but  in-
stead  on  its  support  structure.  And  from  the  known  wire-chafing  problems  of  Rixon,  and  Smith's  teaching  that  "the 

pedal assemblies must not precipitate any motion in the con-necting  wires,"  Smith,  col.  1,  ll.  35-37,  Supp.  App.  274,  the 
designer  would  know  to  place  the  sensor  on  a  nonmoving 
part  of  the  pedal  structure.  The  most  obvious  nonmoving 
point on the structure from which a sensor can easily detect 
the  pedal's  position  is  a  pivot  point.  The  designer,  accord-
ingly, would follow Smith in mounting the sensor on a pivot, 
thereby designing an adjustable electronic pedal covered by 
claim 4. 

Just  as  it  was  possible  to  begin  with  the  objective  to  up-
grade Asano to work with a computer-controlled throttle, so 
too was it possible to take an adjustable electronic pedal like 
Rixon  and  seek  an  improvement  that  would  avoid  the  wire-
chafing  problem.  Following  similar  steps  to  those  just  ex-
plained,  a  designer  would  learn  from  Smith  to  avoid  sensor 
movement and would come, thereby, to Asano because Asano 
disclosed an adjustable pedal with a fixed pivot. 

Teleflex  indirectly  argues  that  the  prior  art  taught  away 
from  attaching a  sensor  to  Asano  because  Asano  in  its  view 
is  bulky,  complex,  and  expensive.  The  only  evidence  Tel-
eflex  marshals  in  support  of  this  argument,  however,  is  the 
Radcliffe  declaration,  which  merely  indicates  that  Asano 
would  not  have  solved  Engelgau's  goal  of  making  a  small, 
simple,  and  inexpensive  pedal.  What  the  declaration  does 
not indicate is that Asano was somehow so flawed that there 
was no reason to upgrade it, or pedals like it, to be compati-
ble  with  modern  engines.  Indeed,  Teleflex's  own  declara-

single  copy  of  software  abroad  with  the  intent  that  it  be  replicated 
invokes  $ 271(f)  liability  for  the  foreign-made  copies.  Judge  Rader, 
dissenting,  noted  that  "supplying"  is  ordinarily  understood  to  mean 
an activity separate and distinct from any subsequent "copying," "repli-
cating,"  or  "reproducing"--in  effect,  manufacturing.  He  further  ob-
served that the only true difference between software components and 
physical components of other patented inventions is that copies of soft-
ware  are easier  to make  and  transport.  But nothing  in  $ 271(f)'s  text, 
Judge  Rader  maintained,  renders  ease  of  copying  a  relevant,  no  less 
decisive,  factor  in  triggering  liability  for  infringement.  The  Court 
agrees.  Under  $ 271(f)'s  text,  the  very  components  supplied  from  the 
United  States,  and  not  foreign-made  copies  thereof,  trigger  liability 
when combined abroad to form the patented invention at issue.  While 
copying  software  abroad  is  indeed  easy  and  inexpensive,  the  same  can 
be  said  of  other  items,  such  as  keys  copied  from  a  master.  Section 
271(f)  contains  no  instruction  to  gauge  when  duplication  is  easy  and 
cheap  enough  to  deem  a  copy  in  fact  made  abroad  nevertheless  "sup-
plie[d] . . . from the United States."  The absence of anything address-
ing copying in the statutory text weighs against a judicial determination 
that  replication  abroad  of  a  master  dispatched  from  the  United  States 
"supplies" the foreign-made copies from this country.  Pp. 452-454. 

(c)  Any doubt that Microsoft's conduct falls outside $ 271(f)'s compass 
would be resolved by the presumption against extraterritoriality.  For-
eign  conduct  is  generally  the  domain  of  foreign  law,  and  in  the  patent 
area, that law may embody different policy judgments about the relative 
rights of inventors, competitors, and the public.  Applied here, the pre-
sumption  tugs  strongly  against  construing  $ 271(f)  to  encompass  as  a 
"component"  not  only  a  physical  copy  of  software,  but  also  software's 
intangible  code,  and  to  render  "supplie[d]  .  .  .  from  the  United  States" 
not  only  exported  copies  of  software,  but  also  duplicates  made  abroad. 
Foreign law  alone, not United States  law, currently  governs the  manu-
facture  and  sale  of  components  of  patented  inventions  in  foreign  coun-
tries.  If  AT&T  desires  to  prevent  copying  abroad,  its  remedy  lies  in 
obtaining and enforcing foreign patents.  Pp. 454-456. 

(d)  While reading $ 271(f) to exclude from coverage foreign-made cop-
ies of software may create a "loophole" in favor of software makers, the 
Court is not persuaded that dynamic judicial interpretation of $ 271(f) is 
in order; the "loophole" is properly left for Congress to consider, and to 
close  if  it  finds such  action warranted.  Section  271(f)  was a  direct  re-
sponse to a gap in U. S. patent law revealed by Deepsouth

otherwise precludes habeas relief, a district court is not required to hold 
an evidentiary hearing.  Pp. 473-475. 

(b)  Contrary to the Ninth Circuit's reasoning, the District Court was 
well within its discretion to determine that, even with the benefit of an 
evidentiary hearing, Landrigan could not develop a factual record enti-
tling him to federal habeas relief.  Pp. 475-480. 

(1)  The Ninth Circuit concluded that the Arizona state courts' find-
ings  that  Landrigan  had  instructed  his  counsel  not  to  offer  any  miti-
gating  evidence  took  Landrigan's  sentencing  colloquy  out  of  context, 
amounting to an unreasonable determination of the facts.  However, the 
colloquy's language plainly indicates that Landrigan told his counsel not 
to  present any mitigating  evidence, and the  record conclusively dispels 
the Circuit's conclusion that Landrigan's statements referred to only his 
ex-wife's  and  birth  mother's  testimony.  On  that  record,  the  state 
court's determination that Landrigan refused to allow the presentation 
of any mitigating evidence was a reasonable determination of the facts. 
Thus, it was not an abuse of discretion for the District Court to conclude 
that Landrigan could not overcome $ 2254(d)(2)'s bar to granting federal 
habeas  relief.  That  court  was  entitled  to  conclude  that  regardless  of 
what  information  counsel  might  have  uncovered  in  his  investigation, 
Landrigan would have interrupted and refused to allow him to present 
it.  Thus, it could conclude that because of his established recalcitrance, 
Landrigan  could  not  demonstrate  prejudice  under  Strickland  even  if 
granted an evidentiary hearing.  Pp. 475-477. 

(2)  The Ninth Circuit also erred in finding two alternative reasons 
for  its  holding.  It  concluded  that  the  Arizona  courts'  determination 
that Landrigan's  claims were  frivolous and  meritless  was  an  unreason-
able  application  of  this  Court's  precedent,  based  on  the  belief,  derived 
from  Wiggins  v.  Smith,  539  U. S.  510,  that  his  last  minute  decision  to 
block testimony could not excuse his counsel's failure to do an adequate 
investigation  before  sentencing.  However,  this  Court  has  never  ad-
dressed a situation in which a client interferes with counsel's efforts to 
present  mitigating  evidence  to  a  sentencing  court.  Thus,  it  was  not 
objectively  unreasonable  for  the  Arizona  postconviction  court  to  con-
clude that a defendant who refused to allow any mitigating evidence to 
be presented could not establish Strickland prejudice based on his coun-
sel's  failure  to  investigate  further  possible  mitigating  evidence.  The 
Ninth Circuit also found  that the record does not indicate that Landri-
gan's decision was informed and knowing, or that he understood its con-
sequences.  This Court has never held that an "informed and knowing" 
requirement exists with respect to the decision not to introduce mitigat-
ing  evidence.  But  even  assuming  such  a  requirement  exists  in  this 
case, Landrigan cannot benefit from it.  First, because he never devel-

Syllabus 
oped  his  claim  properly  before  the  Arizona  courts,  $ 2254(e)(2)  barred 
the  District  Court  from  granting  an  evidentiary  hearing  on  that  basis. 
Second,  his  counsel  told  the  sentencing  court  in  Landrigan's  presence 
that he had carefully explained to Landrigan the importance of mitigat-
ing evidence  in  death  penalty cases  and his duty  as  counsel  to disclose 
mitigating  factors  for  consideration.  In  light  of  Landrigan's  demon-
strated  propensity  for  interjecting  himself  into  the  proceedings,  it  is 
doubtful  that  he  would  have  sat  idly  by  while  counsel  lied  about  such 
discussions.  Third,  it  is  apparent  from  Landrigan's  statement  to  the 
sentencing  court  to  bring  on  the  death  penalty  that  he  clearly  under-
stood the consequences of telling the judge that there were no relevant 
mitigating circumstances.  Pp. 477-480. 

(c)  The Ninth Circuit also erred in rejecting the District Court's find-
ing that the poor quality of Landrigan's alleged mitigating evidence pre-
vented him from making a colorable prejudice claim.  Because most of 
the  evidence  that  Landrigan  now  wishes  to  offer  would  have  been  of-
fered  by  his  birth  mother  and  ex-wife  had  he  allowed  them  to  testify, 
and because the sentencing court had much of the evidence before it by 
way  of  counsel's  proffer,  the  District  Court  could  reasonably  conclude 
that any additional evidence would have made no difference in the sen-
tencing.  Pp. 480-481. 

(d)  Even  assuming  the  truth  of  all  the  facts  Landrigan  sought  to 
prove  at  an  evidentiary  hearing,  he  still  could  not  be  granted  federal 
habeas  relief  because  the  state  courts'  factual  determination  that  he 
would  not  have  allowed  counsel  to  present  any  mitigating  evidence  at 
sentencing  is  not  an  unreasonable  determination  of  the  facts  under 

$ 2254(d)(2), and the mitigating evidence he seeks to introduce would not 
have changed the result.  P. 481.

Court of Appeals held that the District Court abused its dis-
cretion  in  refusing  to  grant  the  hearing.  We  hold  that  it 
did not. 

I 

Respondent Jeffrey Landrigan was convicted in Oklahoma 
of second-degree murder in 1982.  In 1986, while in custody 
for  that  murder,  Landrigan  repeatedly  stabbed  another  in-
mate  and  was  subsequently  convicted  of  assault  and  bat-
tery  with  a  deadly  weapon.  Three  years  later,  Landrigan 
escaped  from  prison  and  murdered  Chester  Dean  Dyer  in 
Arizona. 

An  Arizona  jury  found  Landrigan  guilty  of  theft,  second-
degree  burglary,  and  felony  murder  for  having  caused  the 
victim's  death  in  the  course  of  a  burglary.  At  sentencing, 
Landrigan's  counsel  attempted  to  present  the  testimony  of 
Landrigan's ex-wife and birth mother as mitigating evidence. 
But  at  Landrigan's  request,  both  women  refused  to  testify. 
When  the  trial  judge  asked  why  the  witnesses  refused, 
Landrigan's  counsel  responded  that  "it's  at  my  client's 
wishes."  App.  to  Pet.  for  Cert.  D-3.  Counsel  explained 
that  he had  "advised  [Landrigan]  very  strongly  that  I  think 
it's  very  much  against  his  interests  to  take  that  particular 
position."  Ibid.  The court then questioned Landrigan: 

"THE  COURT:  Mr.  Landrigan,  have  you  instructed 
your  lawyer  that  you  do  not  wish  for  him  to  bring  any 
mitigating circumstances to my attention? 

"THE DEFENDANT: Yeah. 
"THE COURT: Do you know what that means? 
"THE DEFENDANT: Yeah. 
"THE  COURT:  Mr.  Landrigan,  are  there  mitigating 
circumstances I should be aware of? 

"THE  DEFENDANT:  Not  as  far  as  I'm  concerned." 
Id., at D-3 to D-4.

470  SCHRIRO  v.  LANDRIGAN 

Opinion of the Court 
Still  not  satisfied,  the  trial  judge  directly  asked  the  wit-nesses  to  testify.  Both  refused.  The  judge  then  asked 

counsel  to  make  a  proffer  of  the  witnesses'  testimony. Counsel  attempted  to  explain  that  the  witnesses  would  tes-
tify  that  Landrigan's  birth  mother  used  drugs  and  alcohol (including  while  she  was  pregnant  with  Landrigan),  that 
Landrigan abused drugs and alcohol, and that Landrigan had 
been a good father. But Landrigan would have none of it.  When counsel tried 

to explain  that  Landrigan had  worked in a  legitimate  job  to provide  for  his  family,  Landrigan  interrupted  and  stated, 
"If  I  wanted  this  to  be  heard,  I'd  have  my  wife  say  it." 
Id., at D-6.  Landrigan then explained that he was not only 
working  but  also  "doing  robberies  supporting  my  family." 
Id.,  at  D-7.  When  counsel  characterized  Landrigan's  first 
murder as having elements of self-defense,  Landrigan inter-
rupted  and  clarified:  "He  didn't  grab  me.  I  stabbed  him." 
Id.,  at  D-9.  Responding  to  counsel's  statement  implying 
that  the  prison  stabbing  involved  self-defense  because  the 
assaulted inmate knew Landrigan's first murder victim, Lan-
drigan  interrupted  to  clarify  that  the  inmate  was  not  ac-
quainted  with  his  first  victim,  but  just  "a  guy  I  got  in  an 
argument  with.  I  stabbed  him  14  times.  It  was  lucky  he 
lived."  Ibid. 

At  the  conclusion  of  the  sentencing  hearing,  the  judge 
asked Landrigan if he had anything to say.  Landrigan made 
a brief statement that concluded, "I think if you want to give 
me  the  death  penalty,  just  bring  it  right  on.  I'm  ready  for 
it."  Id., at D-16. 

The  trial  judge  found  two  statutory  aggravating  circum-
stances: that Landrigan murdered Dyer in expectation of pe-
cuniary gain and that Landrigan was previously convicted of 
two  felonies  involving  the  use  or  threat  of  violence  on  an-
other  person.  Id.,  at  D-23.  In  addition,  the  judge  found 
two nonstatutory mitigating circumstances: that Landrigan's 
family  loved  him  and  an  absence  of  premeditation.  Ibid.

Opinion of the Court 
Finally, the trial judge stated that she considered Landrigan "a  person who  has  no  scruples  and  no  regard  for  human  life 

and  human  beings."  Ibid.  Based  on  these  findings,  the court  sentenced  Landrigan  to  death.  On  direct  appeal,  the 
Arizona  Supreme  Court  unanimously  affirmed  Landrigan's sentence and conviction.  In addressing an ineffective-
assistance-of-counsel claim not relevant here, the court noted 
that Landrigan had stated his "desire not to have mitigating evidence  presented  in  his  behalf."

postconviction relief and alleged his counsel's "fail[ure] to ex-
plore  additional  grounds  for  arguing  mitigation  evidence." 
App.  to  Pet.  for  Cert.  F-3  (internal  quotation  marks  omit-
ted).  Specifically,  Landrigan  maintained  that  his  counsel 
should  have  investigated  the  "biological  component"  of  his 
violent  behavior  by  interviewing  his  biological  father  and 
other relatives.  Id., at E-2.  In addition, Landrigan stated 
that  his  biological  father  could  confirm  that  his  biological 
mother used drugs and alcohol  while  pregnant with Landri-
gan.  Ibid. 

The  Arizona  postconviction  court,  presided  over  by  the 
same  judge  who  tried  and  sentenced  Landrigan,  rejected 
Landrigan's claim.  The court found that "[Landrigan] 
instructed  his  attorney  not  to  present  any  evidence  at  the 
sentencing  hearing,  [so]  it  is  difficult  to  comprehend  how 
[Landrigan]  can  claim  counsel  should  have  presented  other 
evidence  at  sentencing."  Id.,  at  F-4.  Noting  Landrigan's 
contention that he " `would have cooperated' " had other miti-
gating  evidence  been  presented,  the  court  concluded  that 
Landrigan's  "statements  at  sentencing  belie  his  new-found 
sense of  cooperation."  Ibid.  Describing  Landrigan's  claim 
as  "frivolous,"  id., at  F-5,  the  court  declined to  hold  an  evi-
dentiary  hearing  and  dismissed  Landrigan's  petition.  The 
Arizona  Supreme  Court  denied  Landrigan's  petition  for  re-
view on June 19, 1996.

Opinion of the Court 
Landrigan  then  filed  a  federal  habeas  application  under $ 2254.  The  District  Court  determined,  after  "expand[ing] 

the  record  to  include  .  .  .  evidence  of  [Landrigan's]  troubled background,  his  history  of  drug  and  alcohol  abuse,  and  his 
family's  history  of  criminal  behavior,"  id.,  at  C-22,  that Landrigan could not demonstrate that he was prejudiced by 
any  error  his  counsel  may  have  made.  Because  Landrigan 
could not make out even a "colorable" ineffective-assistance-of-counsel  claim, 

id.,  at  C-46,  the  District  Court  refused  to 
grant him an evidentiary hearing. On  appeal, a  unanimous panel  of the  Court  of Appeals  for 

the Ninth Circuit affirmed, but the full court granted rehear-
ing en banc, Landrigan v.  Stewart, 397 F. 3d 1235 (2005), and 
reversed.  The  en  banc  Court  of  Appeals  held  that  Landri-
gan was entitled to an evidentiary hearing because he raised 
a  "colorable  claim"  that  his counsel's  performance  fell  below 
the  standard  required  by  Strickland  v.  Washington,  466 
U. S. 668 (1984).  441 F. 3d 638, 650 (2006).  With respect to 
counsel's  performance,  the  Ninth  Circuit  found  that  he  "did 
little  to  prepare  for  the  sentencing  aspect  of  the  case,"  id., 
at  643,  and  that  investigation  would  have  revealed  a  wealth 
of mitigating evidence, including the family's history of drug 
and alcohol abuse and propensity for violence. 

Turning  to  prejudice,  the  court  held  the  Arizona  post-
conviction  court's  determination  that  Landrigan  refused  to 
permit  his  counsel  to  present  any  mitigating  evidence  was 
"an  `unreasonable  determination  of  the  facts.' "  Id.,  at  647 
(quoting  28  U. S. C.  $ 2254(d)(2)).  The  Court  of  Appeals 
found  that  when  Landrigan  stated  that  he  did  not  want  his 
counsel  to  present  any  mitigating  evidence,  he  was  clearly 
referring  only  to  the  evidence  his  attorney  was  about  to  in-
troduce--that of his ex-wife and birth mother.  441 F. 3d, at 
646.  The  court  further  held  that,  even  if  Landrigan  in-
tended  to  forgo  the  presentation  of  all  mitigation  evidence, 
such a "last-minute decision cannot excuse his counsel's fail-
ure  to  conduct  an  adequate  investigation  prior  to  the  sen-

Opinion of the Court 
tencing."  Id.,  at  647.  In  conclusion,  the  court  found  "a reasonable  probability  that,  if  Landrigan's  allegations  are 

true,  the  sentencing  judge  would  have  reached  a  different conclusion."  Id., at 650.  The court therefore remanded the 
case for an evidentiary hearing. We  granted  certiorari,  548  U. S.  941  (2006),  and  now 
reverse.  II 

Prior  to  the  Antiterrorism  and  Effective  Death  Penalty Act  of  1996  (AEDPA),  110  Stat.  1214,  the  decision  to  grant 
an  evidentiary  hearing  was  generally  left  to  the  sound  dis-cretion  of  district  courts. 

Brown  v.  Allen,  344  U. S.  443, 463-464 (1953); see also Townsend v.  Sain, 372 U. S. 293, 313 

(1963).  That  basic  rule  has  not  changed.  See  28  U. S. C. $ 2254, Rule 8(a) ("[T]he judge must review the answer [and] 
any transcripts and records of state-court proceedings . . . to determine  whether  an  evidentiary  hearing  is  warranted"). 

AEDPA, however, changed the standards for granting fed-eral  habeas  relief.

1  Under  AEDPA,  Congress  prohibited 

federal  courts  from  granting  habeas  relief  unless  a  state court's  adjudication  of  a  claim  "resulted  in  a  decision  that 

was  contrary  to,  or  involved  an  unreasonable  application of,  clearly  established  Federal  law,  as  determined  by  the 
Supreme Court of the United States," $ 2254(d)(1), or the rel-evant state-court decision "was based on an unreasonable de-
termination  of  the  facts  in  light  of  the  evidence  presented in  the  State  court  proceeding,"  $ 2254(d)(2).  The  question 
under  AEDPA  is  not  whether  a  federal  court  believes  the state  court's  determination  was  incorrect  but  whether  that 
determination  was  unreasonable--a  substantially  higher threshold.  See 

Williams v.  Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 410 (2000). AEDPA  also  requires  federal  habeas  courts  to  presume  the

courts from granting evidentiary hearings when applicants have failed to 
develop  the  factual  bases  for  their  claims  in  state  courts.  28  U. S. C.

Opinion of the Court 
correctness of state courts' factual findings unless applicants 
rebut this presumption with "clear and convincing evi-
dence."  $ 2254(e)(1). 

In  deciding  whether  to  grant  an  evidentiary  hearing,  a 
federal  court  must  consider  whether  such  a  hearing  could 
enable an applicant to prove the petition's factual allegations, 
which,  if  true,  would  entitle  the  applicant  to  federal  habeas 
relief.  See,  e. g.,  Mayes  v.  Gibson,  210  F.  3d  1284,  1287 
(CA10  2000).  Because the  deferential standards  prescribed 
by  $ 2254  control  whether  to  grant  habeas  relief,  a  federal 
court  must  take  into  account  those  standards  in  deciding 
whether  an  evidentiary  hearing  is  appropriate.  See  id.,  at 
1287-1288  ("Whether  [an  applicant's]  allegations,  if  proven, 
would  entitle  him  to  habeas  relief  is  a  question  governed 
by [AEDPA]").2 

It  follows that  if  the  record  refutes  the  applicant's  factual 
allegations  or  otherwise  precludes  habeas  relief,  a  district 
court  is  not  required  to  hold  an  evidentiary  hearing.  The 
Ninth  Circuit has  recognized  this  point in  other  cases,  hold-
ing  that  "an  evidentiary  hearing  is  not  required  on  issues 
that can be resolved by reference to the state court record." 
Totten  v.  Merkle,  137  F.  3d  1172,  1176  (1998)  (emphasis  de-
leted)  (affirming  the  denial  of  an  evidentiary  hearing  where 
the  applicant's  factual  allegations  "fl[ew]  in  the  face  of  logic 
in light of . . . [the applicant's] deliberate acts which are easily 
discernible  from  the  record").  This  approach  is  not  unique 
to the Ninth Circuit.  See Anderson v.  Attorney General of 
Kan.,  425  F.  3d  853,  858-859  (CA10  2005)  (holding  that  no 
evidentiary  hearing  is  required  if  the  applicant's  allegations 
are contravened by the existing record); cf. Clark v.  Johnson, 
202  F.  3d  760,  767  (CA5  2000)  (holding  that  no  hearing  is 
required  when  the  applicant  has  failed  to  present  clear  and

$ 2254(d)(2)  to  reject  certain  of  the  Arizona  court's  factual  findings  that 
established a hearing would be futile.

Opinion of the Court 
with  the  sentencing  court  out  of  context  in  a  manner  that "amounts  to  an  `unreasonable  determination  of  the  facts.' " 

Id., at 647 (quoting 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d)(2)). Upon  review  of  record  material  and  the  transcripts  from 
the  state  courts,  we  disagree.  As  a  threshold  matter,  the language  of  the  colloquy  plainly  indicates  that  Landrigan 
informed his counsel not to present any mitigating evidence. 
When  the  Arizona  trial  judge  asked  Landrigan  if  he  had instructed  his  lawyer  not  to  present  mitigating  evidence, 

Landrigan  responded  affirmatively.  Likewise,  when  asked if there was any relevant mitigating evidence, Landrigan an-
swered,  "Not  as  far  as  I'm  concerned."  App.  to  Pet.  for 
Cert.  D-4.  These  statements  establish  that  the  Arizona 
postconviction court's determination of the facts was reason-
able.  And it is worth noting, again, that the judge presiding 
on  postconviction  review  was  ideally  situated  to  make  this 
assessment  because  she  is  the  same  judge  who  sentenced 
Landrigan and discussed these issues with him. 

Notwithstanding  the  plainness  of  these  statements,  the 
Court  of  Appeals  concluded  that  they  referred  to  only  the 
specific  testimony  that  counsel  planned  to  offer--that  of 
Landrigan's  ex-wife  and  birth  mother.  The  Court  of  Ap-
peals further concluded that Landrigan, due to counsel's fail-
ure  to  investigate,  could  not  have  known  about  the  mit-
igating  evidence  he  now  wants  to  explore.  The  record 
conclusively  dispels  that  interpretation.  First,  Landrigan's 
birth  mother  would  have  offered  testimony  that  overlaps 
with the evidence Landrigan now wants to present.  For ex-
ample, Landrigan wants to present evidence from his biologi-
cal  father  that  would  "confirm [his  biological  mother's]  alco-
hol and drug use during  her  pregnancy."  Id., at E-2.  But 
the  record  shows  that  counsel  planned  to  call  Landrigan's 
birth  mother  to  testify  about  her  "drug  us[e]  during  her 
pregnancy,"  id.,  at  D-10,  and  the  possible  effects  of  such 
drug  use.  Second,  Landrigan  interrupted  repeatedly  when 
counsel  tried  to  proffer  anything  that  could  have  been  con-

Opinion of the Court 
sidered  mitigating.  He  even  refused  to  allow  his  attorney to  proffer  that  he  had  worked  a  regular  job  at  one  point. 

Id., at D-6, D-7.  This behavior confirms what is plain from the  transcript  of  the  colloquy:  that  Landrigan  would  have 
undermined the presentation of any mitigating evidence that his attorney might have uncovered. 

On the record before us, the Arizona court's determination that Landrigan refused to allow the presentation of any miti-
gating evidence was a reasonable determination of the facts. In  this  regard,  we  agree  with  the  initial  Court  of  Appeals 
panel that reviewed this case: 

"In  the  constellation  of  refusals  to  have  mitigating  evi-dence  presented  .  .  .  this  case  is  surely  a  bright  star. 

No  other  case  could  illuminate  the  state  of  the  client's mind  and  the  nature  of  counsel's  dilemma  quite  as 
brightly as this one.  No flashes of insight could be more fulgurous  than  those  which  this  record  supplies. " 
Landrigan  v.  Stewart,  272  F.  3d  1221,  1226  (CA9  2001). 
Because  the  Arizona  postconviction  court  reasonably  de-termined  that  Landrigan  "instructed  his  attorney  not  to 

bring  any  mitigation  to  the  attention  of  the  [sentencing] court,"  App.  to  Pet.  for  Cert.  F-4,  it  was  not  an  abuse  of 
discretion  for the  District Court to conclude that Landrigan could  not  overcome  $ 2254(d)(2)'s  bar  to  granting  federal  ha-
beas relief.  The District Court was entitled to conclude that regardless  of  what  information  counsel  might  have  uncov-
ered in his investigation, Landrigan would have interrupted and  refused  to  allow  his  counsel  to  present  any  such  evi-
dence.  Accordingly,  the  District  Court  could  conclude  that because of his established recalcitrance, Landrigan could not 
demonstrate  prejudice  under  Strickland  even  if  granted  an evidentiary hearing. 

B 
The  Court  of  Appeals  offered  two  alternative  reasons  for holding that Landrigan's inability to make a showing of prej-

Opinion of the Court 
udice  under Strickland  did  not  bar  any  potential habeas  re-lief and, thus, an evidentiary hearing. 

1 
The Court of Appeals held that, even if Landrigan did not want any mitigating evidence presented, the Arizona courts' 

determination  that  Landrigan's  claims  were  " `frivolous'  and `meritless' was an unreasonable application of United States 
Supreme  Court  precedent."  441  F.  3d,  at  647  (citing  28 U. S. C.  $ 2254(d)(1)).  This  holding  was  founded  on  the  be-
lief, derived from Wiggins v.  Smith, 539 U. S. 510 (2003), that "Landrigan's  apparently  last-minute  decision  cannot  excuse 
his  counsel's  failure  to  conduct  an  adequate  investigation 
prior to the sentencing."  441 F. 3d, at 647. Neither  Wiggins  nor  Strickland  addresses  a  situation  in 

which  a  client  interferes  with  counsel's  efforts  to  present mitigating evidence  to a sentencing  court.  Wiggins, supra, 
at 523  ("[W]e focus on  whether the  investigation supporting counsel's  decision  not  to  introduce  mitigating  evidence  of 
Wiggins' background was itself reasonable" (emphasis added and deleted)).  Indeed, we have never addressed a situation 
like  this.  In  Rompilla  v.  Beard,  545  U. S.  374,  381  (2005), on which the Court of Appeals also relied, the defendant re-
fused  to  assist  in  the  development  of  a  mitigation  case,  but did not inform the court that he did not want mitigating evi-
dence presented.  In short, at the time of the Arizona post-conviction  court's  decision,  it  was  not  objectively  unreason-
able for that court to conclude that a defendant who refused to  allow  the  presentation  of  any  mitigating  evidence  could 
not establish Strickland prejudice based on his counsel's fail-ure to investigate further possible mitigating evidence. 

2 
The Court of Appeals also stated that the record does not indicate  that  Landrigan's  decision  not  to  present  mitigating 

evidence was "informed and knowing," 441 F. 3d, at 647, and that "[t]he trial court's dialogue with Landrigan tells us little

Opinion of the Court 
about his understanding of the consequences of his decision," ibid.  We  have  never  imposed  an  "informed  and  knowing" 

requirement  upon  a  defendant's  decision  not  to  introduce evidence.  Cf.,  e. g.,  Iowa  v.  Tovar,  541  U. S.  77,  88  (2004) 
(explaining that waiver of the right to counsel must be know-ing  and  intelligent).  Even  assuming,  however,  that  an 
"informed  and  knowing"  requirement  exists  in  this  case, Landrigan cannot benefit from it, for three reasons. 

First, Landrigan never presented this claim to the Arizona courts.

3  Rather, he argued that he would have complied had 

other  evidence  been  offered.  Thus,  Landrigan  failed  to  de-velop  this  claim  properly  before  the  Arizona  courts,  and 

$ 2254(e)(2)  therefore  barred  the  District  Court  from  grant-ing an evidentiary hearing on that basis. 

Second,  in  Landrigan's  presence,  his  counsel  told  the  sen-tencing  court  that  he  had  carefully  explained  to  Landrigan 
the  importance  of  mitigating  evidence,  "especially  concern-ing  the  fact  that  the  State  is  seeking  the  death  penalty." 
App. to Pet. for Cert. D-3.  Counsel also told the court that he had explained to Landrigan that as counsel, he had a duty 
to disclose "any and all mitigating factors . . . to th[e] [c]ourt for consideration regarding the sentencing."  Ibid.  In light 
of Landrigan's demonstrated propensity for interjecting him-self into the proceedings, it is doubtful that Landrigan would 
have  sat  idly  by  while  his  counsel  lied  about  having  pre-viously  discussed  these  issues  with  him.  And  as  Landri-
gan's  counsel  conceded  at  oral  argument  before  this  Court, we  have  never  required  a  specific  colloquy  to  ensure  that 
a  defendant  knowingly  and  intelligently  refused  to  present mitigating evidence.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 26. 

Third,  the  Court  of  Appeals  overlooked  Landrigan's  final statement  to  the  sentencing  court:  "I  think  if  you  want  to 

3 Landrigan made this argument for the first time in a motion for rehear-
ing  from  the  denial  of  his  postconviction  petition.  Under  Arizona  law,  a

Byers,  126  Ariz.  139,  142,  613  P.  2d  299,  302  (App.  1980),  overruled  on 
other grounds, State v.  Pope, 130 Ariz. 253, 635 P. 2d 846 (1981).

Opinion of the Court 
give me the death penalty, just bring it right on.  I'm ready for  it."  App.  to  Pet.  for  Cert.  D-16.  It  is  apparent  from 

this statement that Landrigan clearly understood the conse-quences  of  telling  the  judge  that,  "as  far  as  [he  was]  con-
cerned,"  there  were  no  mitigating  circumstances  of  which she should be aware.  Id., at D-4. 

IV 
Finally,  the  Court  of  Appeals  erred  in  rejecting  the  Dis-trict  Court's  finding  that  the  poor  quality  of  Landrigan's 

alleged  mitigating  evidence  prevented  him  from  making "a  colorable  claim"  of  prejudice. 

Id.,  at  C-46.  As  summa-rized  by  the  Court  of  Appeals,  Landrigan  wanted  to  intro-

duce as mitigation evidence 

"[that]  he  was  exposed  to  alcohol  and  drugs  in  utero, which may have resulted in cognitive and behavioral de-

ficiencies  consistent  with  fetal  alcohol  syndrome.  He was  abandoned  by  his  birth  mother  and  suffered  aban-
donment and attachment issues, as well as other behav-ioral problems throughout his childhood. 

"His  adoptive  mother  was  also  an  alcoholic,  and  Lan-drigan's  own  alcohol  and  substance  abuse  began  at  an 
early  age.  Based  on  his  biological  family's  history  of violence, Landrigan claims he may also have been genet-
ically predisposed to violence."  441 F. 3d, at 649. 
As explained above, all but the last sentence refer to infor-mation that Landrigan's birth mother and ex-wife could have 

offered  if  Landrigan  had  allowed  them  to  testify.  Indeed, the state postconviction court had much of this evidence be-
fore  it  by  way  of  counsel's  proffer.  App.  to  Pet.  for  Cert. D-21.  The  District  Court  could  reasonably  conclude  that 
any  additional  evidence  would  have  made  no  difference  in the sentencing. 

In  sum,  the  District  Court  did  not  abuse  its  discretion  in finding  that  Landrigan  could  not  establish  prejudice  based

Opinion of the Court 
on his counsel's failure to present the evidence he now wishes to offer.  Landrigan's mitigation evidence was weak, and the 

postconviction  court  was  well  acquainted  with  Landrigan's exceedingly violent past and had seen first hand his belliger-
ent  behavior.  Again,  it  is  difficult  to  improve  upon  the  ini-tial Court of Appeals panel's conclusion: 

"The  prospect  was  chilling;  before  he  was  30  years  of age,  Landrigan  had  murdered  one  man,  repeatedly 
stabbed  another  one,  escaped  from  prison,  and  within two  months  murdered  still  another  man.  As  the  Ari-
zona  Supreme  Court  so  aptly  put  it  when  dealing  with one  of  Landrigan's  other  claims,  `[i]n  his  comments  [to 
the sentencing judge], defendant not only failed to show remorse or offer mitigating evidence, but he flaunted his 
menacing behavior.'  On this record, assuring the court that  genetics  made  him  the  way  he  is  could  not  have 
been  very  helpful.  There  was  no  prejudice."  272 F. 3d, at 1229 (citations and footnote omitted). 

V 
The  Court  of  Appeals  erred  in  holding  that  the  District Court  abused  its  discretion  in  declining  to  grant  Landrigan 

an evidentiary hearing.  Even assuming the  truth of all  the facts  Landrigan  sought  to  prove  at  the  evidentiary  hearing, 
he  still  could  not  be  granted  federal  habeas  relief  because the state courts' factual determination that Landrigan would 
not have allowed counsel to present any mitigating evidence at  sentencing  is  not  an  unreasonable  determination  of  the 
facts under $ 2254(d)(2), and the mitigating evidence he seeks to  introduce  would  not  have  changed  the  result.  In  such 
circumstances, a District Court has discretion to deny an evi-dentiary hearing.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals for 
the  Ninth  Circuit  is  reversed,  and  the  case  is  remanded  for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. 

It is so ordered.

Opinion of the Court 
paid  amount.  Sometimes  it  takes  a  while  for  the  Internal Revenue  Service  (IRS) to determine that  taxes should have 

been  paid  that  were  not.  Section  6404(e)(1)  of  the  Internal Revenue  Code  permits  the  Secretary  of  the  Treasury  to 
abate  interest--to  forgive  it,  partially  or  in  whole--if  the assessment  of  interest  on  a  deficiency  is  attributable  to  un-
reasonable  error  or  delay  on  the  part  of  the  IRS.  Section 6404(h) allows  for judicial review of  the  Secretary's decision 
not to grant such relief.  The question presented in this case is  whether  this  review  may  be  obtained  only  in  the  Tax 
Court,  or  may  also  be  secured in  the  district  courts and  the Court  of  Federal  Claims.  We  hold  that  the  Tax  Court  pro-
vides  the  exclusive  forum  for  judicial  review  of  a  refusal  to abate interest under $ 6404(e)(1), and affirm.

The  Internal  Revenue  Code  provides  that  if  any  amount of  assessed  federal  income  tax  is  not  paid  "on  or  before  the 

last date prescribed for payment," interest "shall be paid for the period from such last date to the date paid."  26 U. S. C. 

$ 6601(a).  Section 6404 of the Code authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to abate any tax or related liability in certain 
circumstances.  As part of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, Con-gress  amended  $ 6404  to  add  subsection  (e)(1),  which,  as 
enacted, provided in pertinent part: 

"In  the  case  of  any  assessment  of  interest  on  . . . any  deficiency  attributable  in  whole  or  in  part  to  any  error 

or delay by an officer or employee of the Internal Reve-nue Service (acting in his official capacity) in performing 
a ministerial act . . .  the  Secretary may abate the assess-ment of all or any part of such interest for any period." 
26 U. S. C. $ 6404(e)(1) (1994 ed.). 
In  the  years  following  passage  of  $ 6404(e)(1),  the  federal courts  uniformly  held  that  the  Secretary's  decision  not  to 

grant an abatement was not subject to judicial review.  See,

II 

In 1986, petitioner John Hinck was a limited partner in an entity  called  Agri-Cal  Venture  Associates  (ACVA).  Along 

with  his  wife,  petitioner  Pamela  Hinck,  Hinck  filed  a  joint return  for  1986  reporting  his  share  of  losses  from  the  part-
nership.  The IRS later examined the tax returns for ACVA and proposed adjustments to deductions that the partnership 
had  claimed  for  1984,  1985,  and  1986.  In  1990,  the  IRS  is-sued a final notice regarding the partnership's returns, disal-
lowing  tens  of  millions  of  dollars  of  deductions.  While  the partnership  sought  administrative  review  of  this  decision, 
the  Hincks,  in  May  1996,  made  an  advance  remittance  of $93,890 to the IRS toward any personal deficiency that might 
result from a final adjustment of ACVA's returns.  In March 1999, the Hincks reached a settlement with the IRS concern-
ing  the  ACVA  partnership  adjustments,  to  the  extent  they affected  the  Hincks'  return.  Shortly  thereafter,  as  a  result 
of  the  adjustments,  the  IRS  imposed  additional  liability against the Hincks: $16,409 in tax and $21,669.22 in interest. 
The  IRS  applied  the  Hincks'  advance  remittance  to  this amount and refunded them the balance of $55,811.78. 

The  Hincks  filed  a  claim  with  the  IRS  contending  that, because  of  IRS  errors  and  delays,  the  interest  assessed 
against them for the period from March 21, 1989, to April 1, 1993,  should  be  abated  under  $ 6404(e)(1).  The  IRS  denied 
the request.  The Hincks then filed suit in the United States Court  of  Federal  Claims  seeking  review  of  the  refusal  to

deficiencies for tax years beginning after July 30, 1996, see $ 301(c), ibid.,

Opinion of the Court 
The  Hincks'  primary  argument  against  exclusive  Tax 
Court  jurisdiction  is  that  by  providing  a  standard  of  re-
view--abuse of discretion--in $ 6404(h), Congress eliminated 
the  primary  barrier  to  judicial  review  that  courts  had  pre-
viously  recognized;  accordingly,  they  maintain,  taxpayers 
may  seek  review  of  $ 6404(e)(1)  determinations  under  stat-
utes granting jurisdiction to the district courts and the Court 
of  Federal  Claims  to  review  tax  refund  actions.  See  28

The  provision  for  appellate  review  is  best  understood  as responding  to  a  congressional  concern  that  if  a  provision  of 

the statute is declared invalid there is an interest in prompt adjudication  by  this  Court.  To  extend  that  review  to  in-
stances  in  which  the  statute  itself  has  not  been  called  into question, giving litigants under the Act preference over liti-
gants  in  other  cases,  does  not  accord  with  that  rationale. This  is  also  consistent  with  our  cases  holding  that  "statutes 
authorizing  appeals  are  to  be  strictly  construed."  Perry

who  objects  to  the  adequacy  of  the  education  provided,  the  IEP's

[hearing  officer's]  findings  and  decision . . .  [has]  the  right  to  bring  a 
civil action with respect to the complaint."  $ 1415(i)(2)(A).  A court or 
hearing  officer  may  require  a  state  agency  "to  reimburse  the  parents 
for  the  cost  of  [private  school]  enrollment  if . . . the  agency  had  not 
made  a  free  appropriate  public  education  available  to  the  child." 

$ 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii).  IDEA  also  governs  when  and  to  what  extent  a 
court may award attorney's fees, see $ 1415(i)(3)(B), including an award 
"to  a  prevailing  party  who  is  the  parent  of  a  child  with  a  disability," 

$ 1415(i)(3)(B)(i)(I).  Pp. 523-526. 

(b)  These  various  provisions  accord  parents  independent,  enforce-
able  rights.  Parents  have  enforceable  rights  at  the  administrative 
stage,  and  it  would  be  inconsistent  with  the  statutory  scheme  to  bar 
them from continuing to assert those rights in federal court at the adju-
dication  stage.  Respondent  argues  that  parental  involvement  is  con-
templated  only  to  the  extent  parents  represent  their  child's  interests, 
but  this  view  is  foreclosed  by  the  Act's  provisions.  The  grammatical 
structure  of  IDEA's  purpose  of  protecting  "the  rights  of  children  with 
disabilities and parents of such children," $ 1400(d)(1)(B), would make no 
sense unless "rights" refers to the parents' rights as well as the child's. 
Other  provisions  confirm  this  view.  See,  e.

own behalf and on behalf of Jacob, a complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio.  In 

reliance upon 20 U. S. C. $ 1415(i)(2) (2000 ed., Supp. IV) they challenged the administrative decision, alleging, among other 
matters: that Jacob had not been provided with a free appro-priate  public  education;  that  his  IEP  was  inadequate;  and 
that  the  school  district  had failed  to  follow  procedures  man-
dated by IDEA.  Pending the resolution of these challenges, the  Winkelmans  had  enrolled  Jacob  in  a  private  school  at 

their own expense.  They had also obtained counsel to assist them with certain aspects of the proceedings, although they 
filed  their  federal  complaint,  and  later  their  appeal,  without 
the  aid  of  an  attorney.  The  Winkelmans'  complaint  sought 
reversal  of  the  administrative  decision,  reimbursement  for 
private-school  expenditures  and  attorney's  fees  already  in-
curred, and, it appears, declaratory relief. 

The  District  Court  granted  respondent's  motion  for  judg-
ment  on  the  pleadings,  finding  it  had  provided  Jacob  with  a 
free  appropriate  public  education.  Petitioners,  proceeding

Opinion of the Court 
The statute sets forth procedures for resolving disputes in a manner that, in the Act's express terms, contemplates par-

ents  will  be  the  parties  bringing  the  administrative  com-plaints.  In  addition  to  the  provisions  we  have  cited,  we 
refer  also  to  $ 1415(b)(8)  (requiring  a  state  educational agency to "develop a model form to assist parents in filing a 
complaint");  $ 1415(c)(2)  (addressing  the  response  an  agency 
must  provide  to  a  "parent's  due  process  complaint  notice"); and  $ 1415(i)(3)(B)(i)  (referring  to  "the  parent's  complaint"). 

A  wide  range  of  review  is  available:  Administrative  com-plaints may be brought with respect to "any matter relating 
to  .  .  .  the  provision  of  a  free  appropriate  public  education." 

$ 1415(b)(6)(A).  Claims  raised  in  these  complaints  are  then 
resolved  at  impartial  due  process  hearings,  where,  again, 
the  statute  makes  clear  that  parents  will  be  participating 
as  parties.  See  generally  supra,

hearing on "any matter relating to the identification, evalua-tion,  or  educational  placement  of  the  child,  or  the  provision 

of  a  free  appropriate  public  educati on  to  such  child. " $ 1415(b)(6)(A).  To  resolve  these  challenges  a  hearing  offi-
cer  must  make  a  decision  based  on  whether  the  child  "re-ceived a free appropriate public education."  $ 1415(f)(3)(E). 
When this hearing has been conducted by a local educational 
agency  rather  than  a  state  educational  agency,  "any  party aggrieved  by  the  findings  and  decision  rendered  in  such  a 

hearing  may  appeal  such  findings  and  decision"  to  the  state educational  agency.  $ 1415(g)(1).  Judicial  review  follows, 
authorized  by  a  broadly  worded  provision  phrased  in  the 
same terms used to describe the prior stage of review: "Any 
party aggrieved" may bring "a civil action."  $ 1415(i)(2)(A). 

These provisions confirm that IDEA, through its text and 
structure,  creates  in  parents  an  independent  stake  not  only 
in  the  procedures  and  costs  implicated  by  this  process  but 
also  in  the  substantive  decisions  to  be  made.  We  therefore 
conclude  that  IDEA  does  not  differentiate,  through  isolated 
references  to  various  procedures  and  remedies,  between 
the  rights  accorded  to  children  and  the  rights  accorded  to 
parents.  As  a  consequence,  a  parent  may  be  a  "party  ag-
grieved"  for  purposes  of  $ 1415(i)(2)  with  regard  to  "any 
matter" implicating these rights.  See $ 1415(b)(6)(A).  The 
status  of  parents  as  parties  is  not  limited  to  matters  that 
relate  to  procedure  and  cost  recovery.  To  find  otherwise 
would  be  inconsistent  with  the  collaborative framework  and 
expansive  system  of  review  established  by  the  Act.  Cf.

reimbursement.  Otherwise the adequacy of the child's edu-cation  would  not  be  regarded  as  relevant  to  any  cause  of 

action the parent might bring; and, as a result, only the child could vindicate the right accorded by IDEA to a free appro-
priate public education. The  potential  for  injustice  in  this  result  is  apparent. 
What is more, we find nothing in the statute to indicate that when Congress required States to provide adequate instruc-
tion  to  a  child  "at  no  cost  to  parents,"  it  intended  that  only some  parents  would  be  able  to  enforce  that  mandate.  The 
statute instead takes pains to "ensure that the rights of chil-dren  with  disabilities  and  parents  of  such  children  are  pro-
tected."  $ 1400(d)(1)(B).  See,  e.

ILEC  intent  on  preserving  its  regional  dominance.  The  complaint's 
general  collusion  premise  fails  to  answer  the  point  that  there  was  no 
need  for  joint  encouragement  to  resist  the  1996  Act,  since  each  ILEC 
had  reason  to  try  to  avoid  dealing  with  CLECs  and  would  have  tried 
to  keep  them  out,  regardless  of  the  other  ILECs'  actions.  Plaintiffs' 
second  conspiracy theory rests on  the competitive reticence  among  the 
ILECs themselves in the wake of the 1996 Act to enter into their com-
petitors' territories, leaving the relevant market highly compartmental-
ized  geographically,  with  minimal  competition.  This  parallel  conduct 
did  not  suggest  conspiracy,  not  if  history  teaches  anything.  Monopoly 
was  the  norm  in  telecommunications,  not  the  exception.  Because  the 
ILECs were born in that world, doubtless liked it, and surely knew the 
adage  about  him  who  lives by the sword,  a  natural  explanation  for the 
noncompetition  is  that  the  former  Government-sanctioned  monopolists 
were sitting tight, expecting their neighbors to do the same.  Antitrust 
conspiracy was not suggested by the facts adduced under either theory 
of the complaint, which thus fails to state a valid $ 1 claim.  This analy-
sis does not run counter to Swierkiewicz

hold that such a complaint should be dismissed. 

I 
The  upshot  of  the  1984  divestiture  of  the  American  Tele-phone  &  Telegraph  Company's  (AT&T) local  telephone  busi-

ness  was  a  system  of  regional  service  monopolies  (variously called  "Regional  Bell  Operating  Companies,"  "Baby  Bells," 
or  "Incumbent  Local  Exchange  Carriers"  (ILECs)),  and  a separate,  competitive  market  for  long-distance  service  from 
which the ILECs were excluded.  More than a decade later, Congress  withdrew  approval  of  the  ILECs'  monopolies  by 
enacting the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (1996 Act), 110 Stat. 56, which "fundamentally restructure[d] local telephone 
markets"  and  "subject[ed]  [ILECs]  to  a  host  of  duties  in-tended  to  facilitate  market  entry."  AT&T

"compelling  common  motivatio[n]"  to  thwart  the  CLECs' competitive  efforts  naturally  led  them  to  form  a  conspiracy; 

"[h]ad  any  one  [ILEC]  not  sought  to  prevent  CLECs  .  .  . from  competing  effectively  .  .  .  ,  the  resulting  greater  com-

more,  parallel  conduct  does  not  suggest  conspiracy,  and  a conclusory  allegation  of  agreement  at  some  unidentified 

point  does  not  supply  facts  adequate  to  show  illegality. Hence,  when  allegations  of  parallel  conduct  are  set  out 
in order to make a $ 1 claim, they must be placed in a context that  raises  a  suggestion  of  a  preceding  agreement,  not 
merely parallel  conduct that  could  just as well  be independ-ent action. 

The  need  at  the  pleading  stage  for  allegations  plausibly suggesting  (not  merely  consistent  with)  agreement  reflects 
the  threshold  requirement  of  Rule  8(a)(2)  that  the  "plain statement"  possess  enough  heft  to  "sho[w]  that  the  pleader 
is  entitled  to  relief."  A  statement  of  parallel  conduct,  even conduct consciously undertaken, needs some setting suggest-
ing the agreement necessary to make out a $ 1 claim; without that  further  circumstance  pointing  toward  a  meeting  of  the 
minds,  an  account  of  a  defendant's  commercial  efforts  stays in  neutral  territory.  An  allegation  of  parallel  conduct  is 
thus  much like  a  naked  assertion  of conspiracy  in  a $ 1  com-plaint: it gets the complaint close to stating a claim, but with-
out  some  further  factual  enhancement  it  stops  short  of  the line  between  possibility  and  plausibility  of  "entitle[ment]  to 
relief."  Cf.  DM

Niemeyer,  Chair,  Advisory  Committee  on  Civil  Rules,  to Hon. Anthony J. Scirica, Chair, Committee on Rules of Prac-
tice and Procedure (May 11, 1999), 192 F. R. D. 354, 357 (2000) (reporting that discovery accounts for as much as 90 percent 
of  litigation  costs  when  discovery  is  actively  employed). 
That potential expense is obvious enough in the present case: plaintiffs  represent  a  putative  class  of  at  least  90  percent  of 

all  subscribers  to  local  telephone  or  high-speed  Internet service in the continental United States, in an action against 
America's largest telecommunications firms (with many thou-
sands of employees generating reams and gigabytes of busi-
ness  records)  for  unspecified  (if  any)  instances  of  antitrust 
violations  that  allegedly  occurred  over  a  period  of  seven 
years. 

It  is  no  answer  to  say  that  a  claim  just  shy  of  a  plausible 
entitlement  to  relief  can,  if  groundless,  be  weeded  out  early 
in the discovery process through "careful case management,"

plaint  first  takes  account  of  the  alleged  "absence  of  any meaningful  competition  between  [the  ILECs]  in  one  anoth-

er's  markets,"  "the  parallel  course  of  conduct  that  each [ILEC]  engaged  in  to  prevent  competition  from  CLECs," 
"and  the  other  facts  and  market  circumstances  alleged  [ear-lier]";  "in  light  of "  these,  the  complaint  concludes  "that  [the 
ILECs] have entered into a contract, combination or conspir-acy  to prevent  competitive entry into  their . . .  markets and 
have  agreed  not  to  compete  with  one  another."  Complaint || 51,  App.  27.

10  The  nub  of  the  complaint,  then,  is  the 

ILECs'  parallel  behavior,  consisting  of  steps  to  keep  the CLECs  out  and  manifest  disinterest  in  becoming  CLECs 

themselves,  and  its  sufficiency  turns  on  the  suggestions raised  by  this  conduct  when  viewed  in  light  of common  eco-

rested  on  the  parallel  conduct  described,  we  doubt  that  the  complaint's 
references to an agreement among the ILECs would have given the notice

Plaintiffs'  second  conspiracy  theory  rests  on  the  competi-tive  reticence  among  the  ILECs  themselves  in  the  wake  of 

the  1996  Act,  which  was  supposedly  passed  in  the  " `hop[e] that the large incumbent local monopoly companies . . . might 
attack  their  neighbors'  service  areas,  as  they  are  the  best situated  to  do  so.' "  Complaint  || 38,  App.  20  (quoting  Con-
sumer  Federation  of  America,  Lessons  from  1996  Telecom-munications  Act:  Deregulation  Before  Meaningful  Competi-
tion Spells Consumer Disaster, p. 12 (Feb. 2000)).  Contrary to  hope,  the  ILECs  declined  " `to  enter  each  other's  service 
territories in any significant way,' " Complaint || 38, App. 20, and  the  local  telephone  and  high-speed  Internet  market  re-
mains  highly  compartmentalized  geographically,  with  mini-mal competition.  Based on this state of affairs, and perceiv-
ing  the  ILECs  to  be  blessed  with  "especially  attractive business  opportunities"  in  surrounding  markets  dominated 
by other ILECs, the plaintiffs assert that the ILECs' paral-lel  conduct  was  "strongly  suggestive  of  conspiracy."  Id.,

works, "[f]irms do not expand without limit and none of them enters  every  market  that  an  outside  observer  might  regard 
as  profitable,  or  even  a  small  portion  of  such  markets." Areeda & Hovenkamp || 307d, at 155 (Supp. 2006) (comment-
ing  on  the  case  at  bar).  The  upshot  is  that  Congress  may have expected some ILECs to become CLECs in the legacy 
territories  of other ILECs, but the disappointment does not make  conspiracy  plausible.  We  agree  with  the  District 
Court's  assessment  that  antitrust  conspiracy  was  not  sug-gested by the facts adduced under either theory of the com-

relief in the other two cases because it was clear at the time, 
as it is now, that AEDPA did not apply to either of them. 

Respondent  argues,  for  the  following  reasons,  that 
AEDPA should not govern his case either.  Like the defend-
ants  in  Newlon  and  Shurn,  respondent  filed  his  federal  ha-
beas  petition  before  the  effective  date  of  AEDPA.  Instead 
of  considering  respondent's  claims,  however,  the  District 
Court sua sponte stayed the habeas proceedings, noting that 
respondent  had  indicated  his  intention  to  file  a  petition  for 
writ  of  certiorari  seeking  this  Court's  review  of  the  state 
courts'  denial  of  postconviction  relief.  Though  the  District 
Court  recognized  that  respondent  was  not  required  to  seek 
certiorari from this Court, it concluded that, if "a state pris-
oner  chooses  to  pursue  writ  of  certiorari,  he  must  first  ex-
haust that remedy before filing a federal habeas corpus peti-
tion."  App.  to  Brief  for  National  Association  of  Criminal 
Defense  Lawyers as Amicus Curiae  15.  Thus, the  District 
Court put respondent to a choice: He could forgo filing a peti-
tion for certiorari, or his habeas petition would be dismissed. 

Respondent  moved  for  reconsideration  and  for  the  ap-
pointment  of  counsel.  The  District  Court  denied  both  mo-
tions,  reiterating  its  view  that  if  respondent  sought  certio-
rari, his federal habeas petition would be premature.  When 
respondent notified the District Court that a petition for cer-
tiorari had been filed, the court made good on its promise: It 
dismissed  respondent's  habeas  petition  "without  prejudice" 
to  his  refiling  "following  exhaustion  of  his  state  proceed-
ings."  Id.,  at  13.  Though  respondent  had  filed  his  habeas 
petition  before  AEDPA  took  effect,  the  District  Court  dis-
missed his petition after the statute was in force. 

Still  without  an  attorney,  respondent  requested  a  certifi-
cate of appealability from the District Court.  The court de-
nied  the  request,  opining  that  reasonable  jurists  could  not 
disagree with  the dismissal of respondent's  petition.  Id., at 
5-6.  Respondent  also  filed  a  notice  of  appeal,  which  the

Court  of  Appeals  construed  as  a  request  for  a  certificate  of appealability and rejected.* 

Respondent refiled his habeas petition after this Court de-nied  review  of  his  state  postconviction  proceedings.  The 
Eighth  Circuit  eventually  concluded  that,  because  respond-ent's  petition  was  filed  after  AEDPA's  effective  date,  his 
claims must be evaluated under that statute's strict standard of  review.  See 

Weaver  v.  Bowersox,  241  F.  3d  1024,  1029 (2001). 

Our  recent  decision  in  Lawrence  v.  Florida, 549  U. S.  327 (2007),  conclusively  establishes  that  the  District  Court  was 
wrong  to  conclude  that,  if  respondent  chose  to  seek  certio-rari,  he  had  to  exhaust  that  remedy  before  filing  a  federal 
habeas  petition.  Lawrence  clarified  that  "[s]tate  review ends when  the  state  courts have  finally  resolved an  applica-
tion  for  state  postconviction  relief "--even  if  a  prisoner  files a  certiorari  petition.  Id.,  at  332;  see  also  id.,  at  332-333 
("[W]e  have  said  that  state  prisoners  need  not  petition  for certiorari to exhaust state remedies" (citing 

Fay v.  Noia, 372 U. S. 391, 435-438 (1963))).  Thus, respondent's habeas peti-

tion,  which  was  fully  exhausted  when  filed,  did  not  become unexhausted  upon  his  decision  to  seek  certiorari.  Because 
the  petition  was  not  premature,  the  District  Court  had  no cause to dismiss it. 

Whether this unusual procedural history leads to the con-clusion,  as  respondent  colorably  contends,  that  the  AEDPA 
standard is simply inapplicable to this case, is a question we find  unnecessary  to  resolve.  Regardless  of  the  answer  to 
that  question,  we  find  it  appropriate  to  exercise  our  discre-tion to prevent these three virtually identically situated liti-
gants  from  being  treated  in  a  needlessly  disparate  manner, 

*Respondent did not seek rehearing or rehearing en banc in the Court 
of Appeals, nor did he file a petition for writ of certiorari from the denial 
of the certificate of appealability.  Pursuit of either would almost certainly 
have been futile.

this  Court  respondents  do  not  dispute  the  validity  of  the warrant or the means by which it was obtained. 

What  Watters  did  not  know  was  that  one  of  the  houses (the  first  to  be  searched)  had  been  sold  in  September  to  a 
Max  Rettele.  He  had  purchased  the  home  and  moved  into it  three  months  earlier  with  his  girlfriend  Judy  Sadler  and 
Sadler's 17-year-old son Chase Hall.  All three, respondents 
here, are Caucasians. On the morning of December 19, Watters briefed six other 

deputies  in  preparation  for  the  search  of  the  houses. Watters  informed  them  they  would  be  searching  for  three 
African-American suspects, one of whom owned a registered 
handgun.  The possibility  a suspect would be armed caused 
the  deputies  concern  for their  own  safety.  Watters had not 
obtained  special  permission  for  a  night  search,  so  he  could 
not  execute  the  warrant  until  7  a.m.  See  Cal.  Penal  Code 
Ann. $ 1533 (West 2000).  Around 7:15 Watters and six other 
deputies knocked on the door and announced their presence. 
Chase Hall answered.  The deputies entered the house after 
ordering Hall to lie face down on the ground. 

The  deputies'  announcement  awoke  Rettele  and  Sadler. 
The  deputies  entered  their  bedroom  with  guns  drawn  and 
ordered them to get out of their bed and to show their hands. 
They protested that they were not wearing clothes.  Rettele 
stood  up  and  attempted  to  put  on  a  pair  of  sweatpants,  but 
deputies  told  him  not  to  move.  Sadler  also  stood  up  and 
attempted,  without  success,  to  cover  herself  with  a  sheet. 
Rettele and Sadler were held at gunpoint for one to two min-
utes before Rettele was allowed to retrieve a robe for Sadler. 
He was then permitted to dress.  Rettele and Sadler left the 
bedroom  within  three  to  four  minutes  to  sit  on  the  couch  in 
the living room. 

By  that  time  the  deputies  realized  they  had  made  a  mis-
take.  They apologized to Rettele and Sadler, thanked them 
for  not  becoming  upset,  and left  within  five  minutes.  They 
proceeded  to  the  other  house  the  warrant  authorized  them

deputy  should  have  known  the  search  and  detention  were unlawful. 

Judge Cowen dissented.  In his view the deputies had au-thority  to  detain  respondents  for  the  duration  of  the  search 
and  were  justified  in  ordering  respondents  from  their  bed because  weapons  could  have  been  concealed  under  the  bed-
covers.  He  also  concluded  that,  assuming  a  constitutional violation, the law was not clearly established. 

The  Court  of  Appeals  denied  rehearing  and  rehearing  en banc. 

II 
Because respondents were of a different race than the sus-pects  the  deputies  were  seeking,  the  Court  of  Appeals  held 

that  "[a]fter  taking  one  look  at  [respondents],  the  deputies should have realized that [respondents] were not the subjects 
of the search warrant and did not pose a threat to the depu-ties'  safety."  Ibid.

during the charging period and the 1998 raise denial each violated Title 
VII  and  triggered  a  new  EEOC  charging  period--fail  because  they

1998  decision  was  unlawful  because  it  "carried  forward"  the effects  of  prior,  uncharged  discrimination  decisions.  Reply 

Brief  for  Petitioner  20.  In  essence,  she  suggests  that  it  is sufficient that discriminatory acts that occurred prior to the 
charging  period  had  continuing  effects  during  that  period. Brief  for  Petitioner  13  ("[E]ach  paycheck  that  offers  a 
woman less pay than a similarly situated man because of her sex  is  a  separate  violation  of  Title  VII  with  its  own  limita-
tions  period, regardless of whether the paycheck  simply im-plements  a  prior  discriminatory  decision  made  outside  the 
limitations  period");  see  also  Reply  Brief  for  Petitioner  20. This argument is squarely foreclosed by our precedents.

and  the  paychecks  that  were  issued  to  her  during  the  180 days  prior  to  the  filing  of  her  EEOC  charge  do  not  provide 

a basis for overcoming that prior failure. In  an  effort  to  circumvent  the  need  to  prove  discrimina-
tory  intent  during  the  charging  period,  Ledbetter  relies  on the intent associated with other decisions made by other per-
sons  at  other  times.  Reply  Brief  for  Petitioner  6  ("Inten-
tional  discrimination  .  .  .  occurs  when  .  .  .  differential  treat-ment takes place, even if the intent to engage in that conduct 

for a discriminatory purpose was made previously"). Ledbetter's attempt to take the intent associated with the 
prior  pay  decisions  and  shift  it  to  the  1998  pay  decision  is 
unsound.  It  would  shift  intent  from  one  act  (the  act  that 
consummates  the  discriminatory  employment  practice)  to  a 
later act that was not performed with bias or discriminatory 
motive.  The effect of this shift would be to impose liability 
in the absence of the requisite intent. 

Our  cases  recognize  this  point.  In  Evans,

Opinion of the Court 
Ledbetter's  appeal  to  the  Fair  Labor  Standards  Act  of 
1938  (FLSA)  is  equally  unavailing.  Stating  that  it  is  "well 
established  that  the  statute  of  limitations  for  violations  of 
the  minimum  wage  and  overtime  provisions  of  the  [FLSA] 
runs anew with each paycheck," Brief for Petitioner 35, Led-
better urges that the same should be true in a Title VII pay 
case.  Again,  however,  Ledbetter's  argument  overlooks  the 
fact  that  an  FLSA  minimum  wage  or  overtime  claim  does 
not require proof of a specific intent to discriminate.  See 29 
U. S. C. $ 207 (establishing overtime rules); cf. $ 255(a) (estab-
lishing 2-year statute of limitations for FLSA claims, except 
for claims  of a  "willful violation,"  which  may  be  commenced 
within 3 years). 

Ledbetter  is  on  firmer  ground  in  suggesting  that  we  look 
to  cases  arising  under  the  National  Labor  Relations  Act 
(NLRA)  since  the  NLRA  provided  a  model  for  Title  VII's 
remedial  provisions  and,  like  Title  VII,  requires  the  filing 
of  a  timely  administrative  charge  (with  the  National  Labor 
Relations  Board)  before  suit  may  be  maintained.  Lorance,

(G)  bear the court's seal. 
(2)  Amendments.--The court may permit a summons to 
be amended. 

(b)  Issuance.--On  or after  filing  the  complaint,  the  plain-tiff  may  present  a  summons  to  the  clerk  for  signature  and 

seal.  If the summons is properly completed, the clerk must 
sign,  seal,  and  issue  it  to  the  plaintiff  for  service  on  the defendant.  A  summons--or  a  copy  of  a  summons  that  is 

addressed  to  multiple  defendants--must  be  issued  for  each defendant to be served. 

(c)  Service. (

1)  In general.--A summons must be served with a copy 
of  the  complaint.  The  plaintiff  is  responsible  for  having the  summons  and  complaint  served  within  the  time  al-

lowed by Rule 4(m) and must furnish the necessary copies to the person who makes service. 

(2)  By  whom.--Any person  who  is  at  least  18 years  old and not a party may serve a summons and complaint. 
(3)  By  a  marshal  or  someone  specially  appointed.--At 
the plaintiff 's request, the court may order that service be made by a United States marshal or deputy marshal or by 

a  person  specially  appointed  by  the  court.  The  court must  so  order  if  the  plaintiff  is  authorized  to  proceed  in 
forma  pauperis  under  28  U. S. C.  $ 1915  or  as  a  seaman 
under 28 U. S. C. $ 1916. 

(d)  Waiving service. 

(1)  Requesting a waiver.--An individual, corporation, or 
association  that  is  subject  to  service  under  Rule  4(e),  (f), 
or (h) has a duty to avoid unnecessary expenses of serving 
the  summons.  The  plaintiff  may  notify  such  a  defendant 
that  an  action  has  been  commenced  and  request  that  the 
defendant  waive  service  of  a  summons.  The  notice  and 
request must: 

(A)  be in writing and be addressed: 

(i)  to the individual defendant; or 
(ii)  for  a  defendant  subject  to  service  under  Rule 
4(h), to an officer, a managing or general agent, or any

other  agent  authorized  by  appointment  or  by  law  to 
receive service of process; 

(B)  name the court where the complaint was filed; 
(C)  be  accompanied  by  a  copy  of  the  complaint,  two 
copies of a waiver form, and a prepaid means for return-
ing the form; 

(D)  inform  the  defendant,  using  text  prescribed  in 
Form  5,  of  the  consequences  of  waiving  and  not  waiv-
ing service; 

(E)  state the date when the request is sent; 
(F)  give  the  defendant  a  reasonable  time  of  at  least 
30  days  after  the  request  was sent--or  at  least  60  days 
if  sent  to  the  defendant  outside  any  judicial  district  of 
the United States--to return the waiver; and 

(G)  be sent by first-class mail or other reliable means. 

(2)  Failure to waive.--If a defendant located within the 
United States fails, without good cause, to sign and return 
a waiver requested by a plaintiff located within the United 
States, the court must impose on the defendant: 

(A)  the  expenses  later  incurred  in  making  service; 
and 

(B)  the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, 
of any motion required to collect those service expenses. 

(3)  Time  to  answer  after  a  waiver.--A  defendant  who, 
before being served with process, timely returns a waiver 
need  not  serve  an  answer  to  the  complaint  until  60  days 
after  the  request  was  sent--or  until  90  days  after  it  was 
sent  to  the  defendant  outside  any  judicial  district  of  the 
United States. 

(4)  Results  of  filing  a  waiver.--When  the  plaintiff  files 
a  waiver,  proof  of  service  is  not  required  and  these  rules 
apply  as  if  a  summons  and  complaint  had  been  served  at 
the time of filing the waiver. 

(5)  Jurisdiction and venue  not waived.--Waiving serv-
ice of a summons does not waive any objection to personal 
jurisdiction or to venue.

plaint to its chief executive officer; or

by that state's law for serving a summons or like process 
on such a defendant. 

(k)  Territorial limits of effective service. 

(1)  In general.--Serving a summons or filing a waiver of 
service establishes personal jurisdiction over  a defendant: 

(A)  who is subject to the jurisdiction of a court of gen-
eral  jurisdiction  in  the  state  where  the  district  court  is 
located; 

(B)  who  is  a  party  joined  under  Rule  14  or  19  and  is

issued; 

(C)  when authorized by a federal statute. 

(2)  Federal claim outside state-court jurisdiction.--For 
a  claim  that  arises  under  federal  law,  serving  a  summons

state's courts of general jurisdiction; and 

(B)  exercising jurisdiction is consistent with the 
United States Constitution and laws.

by a United States marshal or deputy marshal, proof must 
be by the server's affidavit. 

(2)  Service  outside  the  United  States.--Service  not 
within  any  judicial  district  of  the  United  States  must  be 
proved as follows:

plicable treaty or convention; or 

(B)  if  made  under  Rule  4(f)(2)  or  (f)(3),  by  a  receipt 
signed by the addressee, or by other evidence satisfying 
the  court  that  the  summons  and  complaint  were  deliv-
ered to the addressee. 

(3)  Validity  of  service;  amending  proof.--Failure  to 
prove  service does not affect  the validity of service.  The 
court may permit proof of service to be amended. 

(m)  Time  limit  for  service.--If  a  defendant  is  not  served 
within  120  days  after  the  complaint  is  filed,  the  court--on 
motion  or  on  its  own  after  notice  to  the  plaintiff--must  dis-
miss  the  action  without  prejudice  against  that  defendant  or 
order  that  service  be  made  within  a  specified  time.  But  if 
the plaintiff shows good cause for the failure, the court must 
extend the time for service for an appropriate period.  This 
subdivision (m) does not apply to service in a foreign country 
under Rule 4(f ) or 4( j)(1). 

(n)  Asserting jurisdiction over property or assets. 

(1)  Federal  law.--The  court  may  assert  jurisdiction 
over  property  if  authorized  by  a  federal  statute.  Notice 
to claimants of the property must be given as provided in 
the statute or by serving a summons under this rule. 

(2)  State  law.--On  a  showing  that  personal  jurisdiction 
over  a defendant  cannot be obtained in the  district  where 
the action is brought by reasonable efforts to serve a sum-
mons  under  this  rule,  the  court  may  assert  jurisdiction 
over the defendant's assets found in the district.  Jurisdic-
tion  is  acquired  by  seizing  the  assets  under  the  circum-
stances  and  in  the  manner  provided  by  state  law  in  that 
district.

place in the office; or 

(ii)  if the person has no office or the office is closed, 
at  the  person's  dwelling  or  usual  place  of  abode  with

(E)  sending  it  by  electronic  means  if  the  person  con-

filing only  if  reasonable  exceptions  are  allowed.  A  paper 
filed electronically in compliance with a local rule is a writ-
ten paper for purposes of these rules.

1018  RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 

(4)  Acceptance by the clerk.--The clerk must not refuse 
to  file  a  paper  solely  because  it  is  not  in  the  form  pre-
scribed by these rules or by a local rule or practice. 

Rule 5.1.  Constitutional challenge to a statute--notice, cer-

tification, and intervention. 

(a)  Notice by a party.--A party that files a pleading, writ-
ten motion, or other paper drawing into question the consti-
tutionality of a federal or state statute must promptly: 

(1)  file  a  notice  of  constitutional  question  stating  the 
question and identifying the paper that raises it, if: 

(A)  a federal statute is questioned and the parties do 
not include the United States, one of its agencies, or one 
of its officers or employees in an official capacity; or 

(B)  a  state  statute  is  questioned  and  the  parties  do 
not  include  the  state,  one  of  its  agencies,  or  one  of  its 
officers or employees in an official capacity; and 

(2)  serve the  notice and paper on  the Attorney General 
of the United States if a federal statute is  questioned--or 
on  the  state  attorney  general  if  a  state  statute  is  ques-
tioned--either  by  certified  or  registered  mail  or  by  send-
ing  it  to  an  electronic address  designated  by the  attorney 
general for this purpose. 

(b)  Certification  by  the  court.--The  court  must,  under  28 
U. S. C.  $ 2403,  certify  to  the  appropriate  attorney  general 
that a statute has been questioned. 

(c)  Intervention; final decision on the merits.--Unless the 
court  sets  a  later  time,  the  attorney  general  may  intervene 
within  60  days  after  the  notice  is  filed  or  after  the  court 
certifies the challenge, whichever is earlier.  Before the time 
to intervene expires, the court may reject the constitutional 
challenge,  but  may  not  enter  a  final  judgment  holding  the 
statute unconstitutional. 

(d)  No  forfeiture.--A  party's  failure  to  file  and  serve  the 
notice, or the court's failure to certify, does not forfeit a con-
stitutional claim or defense that is otherwise timely asserted.

erence  list  that  identifies  each  item  of  redacted  information 
and  specifies  an  appropriate  identifier  that  uniquely  corre-
sponds to each item listed.  The list must be filed under seal 
and may be amended as of right.  Any reference in the case 
to  a  listed  identifier  will  be  construed  to  refer  to  the  corre-
sponding item of information. 

(h)  Waiver  of protection  of identifiers.--A  person  waives 
the protection of Rule 5.2(a) as to the person's own informa-
tion by filing it without redaction and not under seal.

quired information changes.

(a)  Claim  for  relief.--A  pleading  that  states  a  claim  for relief must contain: 

(1)  a  short  and  plain  statement  of  the  grounds  for  the court's  jurisdiction,  unless  the  court  already  has  jurisdic-
tion and the claim needs no new jurisdictional support; (2)  a  short  and  plain  statement  of  the  claim  showing

1024  RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 

(3)  General and specific denials.--A party that intends in  good  faith  to  deny  all  the  allegations  of  a  pleading-- 

including  the jurisdictional grounds--may do  so by a  gen-eral  denial.  A  party  that  does  not  intend  to  deny  all  the 
allegations  must  either  specifically  deny  designated  alle-gations  or  generally  deny  all  except  those  specifically 
admitted. (4)  Denying  part  of  an  allegation.--A  party  that  in-
tends in good faith to deny only part of an allegation must admit the part that is true and deny the rest. 

(5)  Lacking  knowledge  or  information.--A  party  that lacks  knowledge  or  information  sufficient  to  form  a  belief 
about  the  truth  of  an  allegation  must  so  state,  and  the statement has the effect of a denial. 

(6)  Effect of failing to deny.--An allegation--other than one  relating  to  the  amount  of  damages--is  admitted  if  a 
responsive  pleading  is  required  and  the  allegation  is  not denied.  If  a  responsive  pleading  is  not  required,  an  alle-
gation is considered denied or avoided.

any  supporting  facts  that  are  peculiarly  within  the  par-
ty's knowledge. 

(b)  Fraud  or  mistake;  conditions  of  mind.--In  alleging 
fraud  or  mistake,  a  party  must  state  with  particularity  the 
circumstances constituting fraud or mistake.  Malice, intent, 
knowledge,  and  other  conditions  of  a  person's  mind  may  be 
alleged generally. 

(c)  Conditions  precedent.--In  pleading  conditions  prece-
dent,  it  suffices  to  allege  generally  that  all  conditions  prec-
edent have occurred or been performed.  But when denying 
that  a  condition  precedent  has  occurred  or  been  performed, 
a party must do so with particularity. 

(d)  Official document or act.--In pleading an official docu-
ment  or  official  act,  it  suffices  to  allege  that  the  document 
was legally issued or the act legally done. 

(e)  Judgment.--In  pleading  a  judgment  or  decision  of  a 
domestic or foreign court, a judicial or quasi-judicial tribunal, 
or  a  board  or  officer,  it  suffices  to  plead  the  judgment  or 
decision without showing jurisdiction to render it. 

( f )  Time and place.--An allegation of time or place is ma-
terial when testing the sufficiency of a pleading. 

( g)  Special  damages.--If  an  item  of  special  damage  is 
claimed, it must be specifically stated. 

(h)  Admiralty or maritime claim. 

(1)  How  designated.--If  a  claim  for  relief  is  within  the 
admiralty  or  maritime  jurisdiction  and  also  within  the 
court's  subject-matter  jurisdiction  on  some  other  ground, 
the  pleading  may  designate  the  claim  as  an  admiralty  or 
maritime  claim  for  purposes  of  Rules  14(c),  38(e),  and  82 
and  the  Supplemental  Rules  for  Admiralty  or  Maritime 
Claims and Asset Forfeiture Actions.  A claim cognizable 
only  in  the  admiralty  or  maritime  jurisdiction  is  an  admi-
ralty or maritime claim for those purposes, whether or not 
so designated. 

(2)  Designation for appeal.--A case that includes an ad-
miralty or maritime claim within this subdivision (h) is an 
admiralty case within 28 U. S. C. $ 1292(a)(3).

1027 RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 
Rule 10.  Form of pleadings. 

(a)  Caption; names of parties.--Every pleading must 
have  a  caption with  the  court's  name,  a  title, a  file  number, 
and a Rule 7(a) designation.  The title of the complaint must 
name  all the  parties;  the  title  of  other  pleadings,  after  nam-
ing  the  first  party  on  each  side,  may  refer  generally  to 
other parties. 

(b)  Paragraphs; separate statements.--A party must state 
its claims  or defenses in  numbered  paragraphs,  each limited 
as far as practicable to a single set of circumstances.  A later 
pleading  may  refer  by  number  to  a  paragraph  in  an  earlier 
pleading.  If  doing  so  would  promote  clarity,  each  claim 
founded  on  a  separate  transaction  or  occurrence--and  each 
defense  other  than  a  denial--must  be  stated  in  a  separate 
count or defense. 

(c)  Adoption  by  reference;  exhibits.--A  statement  in  a 
pleading  may  be  adopted  by  reference  elsewhere  in  the 
same  pleading  or  in  any  other  pleading  or  motion.  A  copy 
of  a  written  instrument  that  is  an  exhibit  to  a  pleading  is  a 
part of the pleading for all purposes. 

Rule 11.  Signing pleadings, motions, and other papers; rep-

resentations to the court; sanctions. 

(a)  Signature.--Every pleading, written motion, and other 
paper  must  be  signed  by  at  least  one  attorney  of  record  in 
the attorney's name--or by a party personally if the party is 
unrepresented.  The  paper  must  state  the  signer's  address, 
e-mail  address,  and  telephone  number.  Unless  a  rule  or 
statute  specifically  states  otherwise,  a  pleading  need  not  be 
verified  or  accompanied  by  an  affidavit.  The  court  must 
strike  an  unsigned  paper  unless  the  omission  is  promptly 
corrected  after  being  called  to  the  attorney's  or  party's 
attention. 

(b)  Representations  to  the  court.--By  presenting  to  the 
court  a  pleading,  written  motion,  or  other  paper--whether 
by  signing,  filing,  submitting,  or  later  advocating  it--an  at-
torney  or  unrepresented  party  certifies  that  to  the  best  of

the person's knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances: 

(1)  it  is  not  being  presented  for  any  improper  purpose, such  as  to  harass,  cause  unnecessary  delay,  or  needlessly 
increase the cost of litigation; (2)  the claims, defenses, and other legal contentions are 
warranted  by  existing  law  or  by  a  nonfrivolous  argument for  extending,  modifying,  or  reversing  existing  law  or  for 
establishing new law; (3)  the  factual  contentions  have  evidentiary  support  or, 
if specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary sup-port  after  a  reasonable  opportunity  for  further  investiga-
tion or discovery; and (4)  the  denials  of  factual  contentions  are  warranted  on 
the evidence or, if specifically so identified, are reasonably based on belief or a lack of information. 

(c)  Sanctions. (

1)  In general.--If, after notice and a reasonable oppor-tunity  to  respond,  the  court  determines  that  Rule  11(b) 

has  been  violated,  the  court  may  impose  an  appropriate sanction  on  any  attorney,  law  firm,  or  party  that  violated 
the  rule  or  is  responsible  for  the  violation.  Absent  ex-ceptional  circumstances,  a  law  firm  must  be  held  jointly 
responsible  for  a  violation  committed  by  its  partner,  as-sociate, or employee. 

(2)  Motion for sanctions.--A motion for sanctions must be  made  separately  from  any  other  motion  and  must  de-
scribe  the  specific  conduct  that  allegedly  violates  Rule 11(b).  The  motion  must  be  served  under  Rule  5,  but  it 
must  not  be  filed  or  be  presented  to  the  court  if  the  chal-lenged paper, claim, defense, contention, or denial is with-
drawn  or  appropriately  corrected  within  21  days  after service  or  within  another  time  the  court  sets.  If  war-
ranted,  the  court  may  award  to  the  prevailing  party  the reasonable  expenses,  including  attorney's  fees,  incurred 
for the motion. (

3)  On  the  court's  initiative.--On  its  own,  the  court may  order  an  attorney,  law  firm,  or  party  to  show  cause 

Date/Time: 05-12-10 16:26:21

1029 RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 
why conduct specifically described in the order has not vio-
lated Rule 11(b). 

(4)  Nature  of  a  sanction.--A  sanction  imposed  under 
this  rule  must  be  limited  to  what  suffices  to  deter  repeti-
tion  of  the  conduct  or  comparable  conduct  by  others  sim-
ilarly  situated.  The  sanction  may  include  nonmonetary 
directives;  an  order  to  pay  a  penalty  into  court;  or,  if  im-
posed  on  motion  and  warranted  for  effective  deterrence, 
an order directing payment to the movant of part or all of 
the reasonable attorney's fees and other expenses directly 
resulting from the violation. 

(5)  Limitations on monetary sanctions.--The court 
must not impose a monetary sanction: 

(A)  against  a  represented  party  for  violating  Rule 
11(b)(2); or 

(B)  on  its  own,  unless  it  issued  the  show-cause  order 
under Rule 11(c)(3) before voluntary dismissal or settle-
ment of the claims made by or against the party that is, 
or whose attorneys are, to be sanctioned. 

(6)  Requirements  for  an  order.--An  order  imposing  a 
sanction must describe the sanctioned conduct and explain 
the basis for the sanction. 

(d)  Inapplicability to discovery.--This rule does not  
apply  to  disclosures  and  discovery  requests,  responses,  ob-
jections, and motions under Rules 26 through 37. 

Rule 12.  Defenses and objections: when and how presented; 

motion  for  judgment  on  the  pleadings;  consolidating 
motions; waiving defenses; pretrial hearing. 

(a)  Time to serve a responsive pleading. 

(1)  In general.--Unless another time is specified by this 
rule or a federal statute, the time for serving a responsive 
pleading is as follows: 

(A)  A defendant must serve an answer: 

(i)  within 20 days after being served with the sum-
mons and complaint; or 

Date/Time: 05-12-10 16:26:21

1030  RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 

(ii)  if  it  has  timely  waived  service  under  Rule  4(d), within 60 days after the request for a waiver was sent, 

or  within  90  days  after  it  was  sent  to  the  defendant outside any judicial district of the United States. 

(B)  A  party  must  serve  an  answer  to  a  counterclaim or crossclaim within 20 days after being served with the 
pleading  that  states  the  counterclaim  or  crossclaim. (C)  A  party  must  serve  a  reply  to  an  answer  within 
20 days after being served with an order to reply, unless the order specifies a different time. 

(2)  United  States  and  its  agencies,  officers,  or  employ-
ees  sued  in  an  official  capacity.--The  United  States,  a 
United  States  agency,  or  a  United  States  officer  or  em-ployee  sued  only  in  an  official  capacity  must  serve  an  an-

swer to a complaint, counterclaim, or crossclaim within 60 days after service on the United States attorney. 

(3)  United States officers or employees sued in an indi-
vidual  capacity.--A  United  States  officer  or  employee 
sued in an individual capacity for an act or omission occur-
ring  in  connection  with  duties  performed  on  the  United States'  behalf must serve  an  answer to a  complaint, coun-

terclaim, or crossclaim within 60 days after service on the officer  or  employee  or  service  on  the  United  States  attor-
ney, whichever is later. 

(4)  Effect  of  a  motion.--Unless  the  court  sets  a  differ-
ent  time,  serving  a  motion  under  this  rule  alters  these 
periods as follows: 

(A)  if the court denies the motion or postpones its dis-
position  until  trial,  the  responsive  pleading  must  be 
served  within  10  days  after  notice  of  the  court's  action; 
or 

(B)  if  the  court  grants  a  motion  for  a  more  definite 
statement,  the  responsive  pleading  must  be  served 
within  10  days  after  the  more  definite  statement  is 
served. 

(b)  How to present defenses.--Every defense to a claim for 
relief  in  any  pleading  must  be  asserted  in  the  responsive

1031 RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 
pleading if one is required.  But a party may assert the fol-lowing defenses by motion: 

(1)  lack of subject-matter jurisdiction; (2)  lack of personal jurisdiction; 
(3)  improper venue; (4)  insufficient process; 
(5)  insufficient service of process; (6)  failure  to  state  a  claim  upon  which  relief  can  be 
granted; and (7)  failure to join a party under Rule 19. 

A  motion  asserting any  of  these  defenses  must be  made  be-fore pleading if a responsive pleading is allowed.  If a plead-
ing sets out a claim for relief that does not require a respon-sive  pleading,  an  opposing  party  may  assert  at  trial  any 
defense to that claim.  No defense or objection is waived by joining it with one or more other defenses or objections in a 
responsive pleading or in a motion. (

c)  Motion  for  judgment  on  the  pleadings.--After  the pleadings are closed--but early enough not to delay trial--a 

party may move for judgment on the pleadings. (d)  Result of presenting matters outside the  pleadings.-- 
If,  on  a  motion  under  Rule  12(b)(6)  or 12(c),  matters  outside the  pleadings  are  presented  to  and  not  excluded  by  the 
court, the motion must be treated as one for summary judg-ment under Rule 56.  All parties must be given a reasonable 
opportunity  to  present  all  the  material  that  is  pertinent  to the motion. 

(e)  Motion  for  a  more  definite  statement.--A  party  may move  for  a  more  definite  statement  of  a  pleading  to  which 
a  responsive  pleading  is  allowed  but  which  is  so  vague  or ambiguous  that  the  party  cannot  reasonably  prepare  a  re-
sponse.  The motion must be made before filing a responsive pleading  and  must  point  out  the  defects  complained  of  and 
the  details  desired.  If  the  court  orders  a  more  definite statement  and  the  order  is  not  obeyed  within  10  days  after 
notice  of  the  order  or  within  the  time  the  court  sets,  the court  may  strike  the  pleading  or  issue  any  other  appro-
priate order.

1032  RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 

( f )  Motion to strike.--The court may strike from a plead-
ing  an  insufficient  defense  or  any  redundant,  immaterial, 
impertinent, or scandalous matter.  The court may act: 

(1)  on its own; or 
(2)  on motion made by a party either before responding 
to  the  pleading  or,  if  a  response  is  not  allowed,  within  20 
days after being served with the pleading. 

( g)  Joining motions. 

(1)  Right  to  join.--A  motion  under  this  rule  may  be 
joined with any other motion allowed by this rule. 

(2)  Limitation  on  further  motions.--Except  as  pro-
vided  in  Rule  12(h)(2)  or  (3),  a  party  that  makes  a motion 
under  this  rule  must  not  make  another  motion  under  this 
rule  raising  a  defense  or  objection  that  was  available  to 
the party but omitted from its earlier motion. 

(h)  Waiving and preserving certain defenses. 

(1)  When  some  are  waived.--A  party  waives  any  de-
fense listed in Rule 12(b)(2)-(5) by: 

(A)  omitting it from a motion in the circumstances de-
scribed in Rule 12(g)(2); or 

(B)  failing to either: 

(i)  make it by motion under this rule; or 
(ii)  include  it  in  a  responsive  pleading  or  in  an 
amendment  allowed  by  Rule  15(a)(1)  as  a  matter  of 
course. 

(2)  When to raise others.--Failure to state a claim upon 
which  relief  can  be  granted,  to  join  a  person  required  by 
Rule  19(b),  or  to  state  a  legal  defense  to  a  claim  may  be 
raised: 

(A)  in  any  pleading  allowed  or  ordered  under  Rule 
7(a); 

(B)  by a motion under Rule 12(c); or 
(C)  at trial.

1033 RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 
(i)  Hearing before trial.--If a party so moves, any defense 
listed  in  Rule  12(b)(1)-(7)--whether  made  in  a  pleading  or 
by  motion--and  a  motion  under  Rule  12(c)  must  be  heard 
and  decided  before  trial  unless  the  court  orders  a  deferral 
until trial. 

Rule 13.  Counterclaim and crossclaim. 

(a)  Compulsory counterclaim. 

(1)  In  general.--A  pleading  must  state  as  a  counter-
claim  any  claim  that--at  the  time  of  its  service--the 
pleader has against an opposing party if the claim: 

(A)  arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is 
the subject matter of the opposing party's claim; and 

(B)  does not require adding another party over whom 
the court cannot acquire jurisdiction. 

(2)  Except ions.--The  pleader  need  not  state  the 
claim if: 

(A)  when  the  action  was  commenced,  the  claim  was 
the subject of another pending action; or 

(B)  the  opposing  party  sued  on  its  claim  by  attach-
ment  or  other  process  that  did  not  establish  personal 
jurisdiction  over  the  pleader  on  that  claim,  and  the 
pleader  does  not  assert  any  counterclaim  under  this 
rule. 

(b)  Permissive counterclaim.--A  pleading may  state  as a 
counterclaim  against  an  opposing  party  any  claim  that  is 
not compulsory. 

(c)  Reli ef sought in a counterclaim.--A  counterclaim 
need  not  diminish  or  defeat  the  recovery  sought  by  the  op-
posing  party.  It may request  relief that  exceeds  in  amount 
or  differs  in  kind  from  the  relief  sought  by  the  opposing 
party. 

(d)  Counterclaim against the United States.--These rules 
do not expand the right to assert a counterclaim--or to claim 
a credit--against the United States or a United States officer 
or agency.

1034  RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 

(e)  Counterclaim  maturing  or acquired  after  pleading.-- The  court  may  permit  a  party  to  file  a  supplemental  plead-

ing  asserting  a  counterclaim  that  matured  or  was  acquired by the party after serving an earlier pleading. 

( f )  Omi tted counterclaim.--The court may permit a party  to  amend  a  pleading  to  add  a  counterclaim  if  it  was 
omitted  through  oversight,  inadvertence,  or  excusable  ne-glect or if justice so requires. 

( g)  Crossclaim against  a coparty.--A  pleading may  state as  a  crossclaim  any  claim  by  one  party  against  a  coparty  if 
the  claim  arises  out  of  the  transaction  or  occurrence  that  is 
the subject matter of the original action or of a counterclaim, or  if  the  claim  relates  to  any  property  that  is  the  subject 

matter of the original action.  The crossclaim may include a claim that the coparty is or may be liable to the crossclaimant 
for  all  or  part  of  a  claim  asserted  in  the  action  against  the crossclaimant. 

(h)  Joining  additional  parties.--Rules  19  and  20  govern the  addition  of  a  person  as  a  party  to  a  counterclaim  or 
crossclaim. (

i)  Separate  trials;  separate  judgments.--If  the  court  or-
ders separate trials under Rule 42(b), it may enter judgment on a counterclaim or crossclaim under Rule 54(b) when it has 

jurisdiction to do so, even if the opposing party's claims have 
been dismissed or otherwise resolved. 

Rule 14.  Third-party practice. 

(a)  When  a  defending  party  may  bring  in  a  third  party. 

(1)  Timing of the summons and complaint.--A defend-
ing  party  may,  as  third-party  plaintiff,  serve  a  summons 
and  complaint  on  a  nonparty  who  is  or  may  be  liable  to  it 
for all or part of the claim against it.  But the third-party 
plaintiff must, by motion, obtain the court's leave if it files 
the third-party complaint more than 10 days after serving 
its original answer. 

(2)  Third-party  defendant's  claims  and  defenses.--The 
person  served  with  the  summons  and  third-party  com-
plaint--the "third-party defendant": 

Date/Time: 05-12-10 16:26:21
Job: 550RUL Unit: U$CV Pagination Table: RULES1

1035 RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 
(A)  must  assert  any  defense  against  the  third-party 
plaintiff 's claim under Rule 12; 

(B)  must  assert  any  counterclaim  against  the  third-
party  plaintiff  under  Rule  13(a),  and  may  assert  any 
counterclaim  against  the  third-party  plaintiff  under 
Rule 13(b) or any crossclaim against another third-party 
defendant under Rule 13(g); 

(C)  may  assert  against  the  plaintiff  any  defense  that 
the  third-party  plaintiff  has  to  the  plaintiff 's  claim;  and 

(D)  may  also  assert  against  the  plaintiff  any  claim 
arising  out  of  the  transaction  or  occurrence  that  is  the 
subject  matter of  the  plaintiff 's claim  against  the  third-
party plaintiff. 

(3)  Plaintiff 's  claims  against  a  third-party  defend-
ant.--The  plaintiff may  assert  against  the  third-party  de-
fendant  any  claim  arising  out  of  the  transaction  or  occur-
rence  that  is  the  subject  matter  of  the  plaintiff 's  claim 
against the third-party plaintiff.  The third-party defend-
ant  must  then  assert  any  defense  under  Rule  12  and  any 
counterclaim  under  Rule  13(a),  and  may  assert  any  coun-
terclaim  under  Rule  13(b)  or  any  crossclaim  under  Rule 
13(g). 

(4)  Motion  to  strike,  sever,  or  try  separately.--Any 
party  may  move  to  strike  the  third-party  claim,  to  sever 
it, or to try it separately. 

(5)  Third-par ty  de fendan t's claim against a  no n-
party.--A  third-party  defendant  may  proceed  under  this 
rule  against  a  nonparty  who  is  or  may  be  liable  to  the 
third-party defendant for all or part of any claim against it. 

(6)  Third-party  complaint  in  rem.--If  it  is  within  the 
admiralty or maritime jurisdiction, a third-party complaint 
may  be  in  rem.  In  that  event,  a  reference  in  this  rule  to 
the "summons" includes the warrant of arrest, and a refer-
ence  to  the  defendant  or  third-party  plaintiff  includes, 
when appropriate, a person who asserts a right under Sup-
plemental Rule C(6)(a)(i) in the property arrested.

1036  RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 

(b)  When  a  plaintiff  may  bring  in  a  third  party.--When a claim is asserted against a plaintiff, the plaintiff may bring 

in a third party if this rule would allow a defendant to do so. (c)  Admiralty or maritime claim. 

(1)  Scope  of  impleader.--If  a  plaintiff  asserts  an  admi-ralty  or  maritime  claim under  Rule  9(h), the  defendant or 
a  person  who  asserts  a  right  under  Supplemental  Rule C(6)(a)(i)  may,  as  a  third-party  plaintiff,  bring  in  a  third-
party  defendant  who  may  be  wholly  or  partly  liable-- either  to  the  plaintiff  or  to  the  third-party  plaintiff--for 
remedy  over, contribution,  or otherwise  on account  of the same  transaction,  occurrence,  or  series  of  transactions  or 
occurrences. (

2)  Defending  against  a  demand  for  judgment  for  the plaintiff.--The  third-party  plaintiff  may  demand  judg-

ment  in  the  plaintiff 's  favor  against  the  third-party  de-fendant.  In  that  event,  the  third-party  defendant  must 
defend  under  Rule  12  against  the  plaintiff 's  claim  as  well as  the  third-party  plaintiff 's  claim;  and  the  action  pro-
ceeds  as  if  the  plaintiff  had  sued  both  the  third-party  de-fendant and the third-party plaintiff. 

Rule 15.  Amended and supplemental pleadings. 

(a)  Amendments before trial. (

1)  Amending  as  a  matter  of  course.--A  party  may amend its pleading once as a matter of course: 

(A)  before  being  served  with  a  responsive  pleading; or 
(B)  within  20  days  after  serving  the  pleading  if  a  re-sponsive  pleading  is  not  allowed  and  the  action  is  not 
yet on the trial calendar. 
(2)  Other amendments.--In all other cases, a party may 
amend its pleading only with the opposing party's written consent or the court's leave.  The court should freely give 

leave when justice so requires. (

3)  Time  to  respond.--Unless  the  court  orders  other-
wise, any required response to an amended pleading must 
be made within the time remaining to respond to the origi-

Date/Time: 05-12-10 16:26:21

1037 RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 
nal  pleading  or  within  10  days  after  service  of  the 
amended pleading, whichever is later. 

(b)  Amendments during and after trial. 

(1)  Based on  an objection  at  trial.--If,  at trial,  a  party 
objects that evidence is not within the issues raised in the 
pleadings,  the  court  may  permit  the  pleadings  to  be 
amended.  The  court should  freely  permit  an amendment 
when  doing  so  will  aid  in  presenting  the  merits  and  the 
objecting party fails to satisfy the court that the evidence 
would prejudice that party's action or defense on the mer-
its.  The  court may grant  a continuance  to enable the  ob-
jecting party to meet the evidence. 

(2)  For  issues  tried  by  consent.--When  an  issue  not 
raised  by  the  pleadings  is  tried  by  the  parties'  express  or 
implied  consent,  it  must  be  treated  in  all  respects  as  if 
raised in the pleadings.  A party may move--at any time, 
even  after  judgment--to  amend  the  pleadings  to  conform 
them to the evidence and to raise an unpleaded issue.  But 
failure  to  amend  does  not  affect  the  result  of  the  trial  of 
that issue. 

(c)  Relation back of amendments. 

(1)  When an amendment relates back.--An amendment 
to a pleading relates back to the date of the original plead-
ing when: 

(A)  the  law  that  provides  the  applicable  statute  of 
limitations allows relation back; 

(B)  the  amendment  asserts  a  claim  or  defense  that 
arose  out  of  the  conduct,  transaction,  or  occurrence  set 
out--or  attempted  to  be  set  out--in  the  original  plead-
ing; or 

(C)  the  amendment  changes  the  party  or  the  naming 
of  the  party  against  whom  a  claim  is  asserted,  if  Rule 
15(c)(1)(B) is satisfied and if, within the period provided 
by  Rule  4(m)  for  serving  the  summons  and  complaint, 
the party to be brought in by amendment: 

(i)  received  such  notice  of  the  action  that  it  will 
not  be  prejudiced  in  defending  on  the  merits;  and 

Date/Time: 05-12-10 16:26:21

1038  RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 

(ii)  knew  or  should  have  known  that  the  action 
would have been brought against it, but for a mistake 
concerning the proper party's identity. 

(2)  Notice  to  the  United  States.--When  the  United 
States  or  a  United  States  officer  or  agency  is  added  as  a 
defendant by amendment, the notice requirements of Rule 
15(c)(1)(C)(i)  and  (ii)  are  satisfied  if,  during  the  stated  pe-
riod, process was delivered or mailed to the United States 
attorney  or  the  United  States  attorney's  designee,  to  the 
Attorney  General  of  the  United  States,  or  to  the  officer 
or agency. 

(d)  Supplemental  pleadings.--On  motion  and  reasonable 
notice, the court may, on just terms, permit a party to serve 
a  supplemental  pleading  setting  out  any  transaction,  occur-
rence, or event that happened after the date of the pleading 
to  be  supplemented.  The  court  may  permit  supplementa-
tion even though the original pleading is defective in stating 
a  claim  or  defense.  The  court  may  order  that  the  opposing 
party  plead  to  the  supplemental  pleading  within  a  specified 
time. 

Rule 16.  Pretrial conferences; scheduling; management. 

(a)  Purposes of a pretrial conference.--In any action, the 
court  may  order  the  attorneys  and  any  unrepresented  par-
ties  to  appear  for  one  or  more  pretrial  conferences  for  such 
purposes as: 

(1)  expediting disposition of the action; 
(2)  establishing early and continuing control so that the 
case will not be protracted because of lack of management; 

(3)  discouraging wasteful pretrial activities; 
(4)  improving the quality of the trial through more thor-
ough preparation; and 

(5)  facilitating settlement.

(B)  after  consulting  with  the  parties'  attorneys  and any unrepresented parties at a scheduling conference or 
by telephone, mail, or other means. 
(2)  Time to issue.--The judge must issue the scheduling 
order  as  soon  as  practicable,  but  in  any  event  within  the earlier  of  120  days  after  any  defendant  has  been  served 

with  the  complaint  or  90  days  after  any  defendant  has appeared. 

(3)  Contents of the order. (

A)  Required  contents.--The  scheduling  order  must 
limit the time to join other parties, amend the pleadings, 
complete discovery, and file motions. (

(i)  modify  the  timing  of  disclosures  under  Rules 26(a) and 26(e)(1); 

(ii)  modify the extent of discovery; (iii)  provide for disclosure or discovery of electroni-
cally stored information; (iv)  include  any  agreements  the  parties  reach  for 
asserting  claims  of  privilege  or  of  protection  as  trial-
preparation material after information is produced; 

(v)  set  dates  for  pretrial  conferences  and  for  trial; 
and 

(vi)  include other appropriate matters. 

(4)  Modifying a schedule.--A schedule may be modified 
only for good cause and with the judge's consent. 

(c)  Attendance  and  matters  for  consideration  at  a  pre-
trial conference.

at  least  one  of  its  attorneys  to  make  stipulations  and 
admissions  about  all  matters  that  can  reasonably  be  an-
ticipated  for  discussion  at  a  pretrial  conference.  If 
appropriate, the court may require that a party or its rep-

resentative  be  present  or  reasonably  available  by  other 
means to consider possible settlement. 

(2)  Matters for  consideration.--At  any  pretrial  confer-
ence,  the  court  may  consider  and  take  appropriate  action 
on the following matters: 

(A)  formulating and simplifying the issues, and elimi-
nating frivolous claims or defenses; 

(B)  amending the pleadings if necessary or desirable; 
(C)  obtaining  admissions  and  stipulations  about  facts 
and documents to avoid unnecessary proof, and ruling in 
advance on the admissibility of evidence; 

(D)  avoiding  unnecessary  proof  and  cumulative  evi-
dence,  and  limiting  the  use  of  testimony  under  Federal 
Rule of Evidence 702; 

(E)  determining  the  appropriateness  and  timing  of 
summary adjudication under Rule 56; 

(F)  controlling and scheduling discovery, including or-
ders  affecting  disclosures  and  discovery  under  Rule  26 
and Rules 29 through 37; 

(G)  identifying  witnesses  and  documents,  scheduling 
the filing and exchange of any pretrial briefs, and setting 
dates for further conferences and for trial; 

(H)  referring  matters  to  a  magistrate  judge  or  a 
master; 

(I)  settling  the  case  and  using  special  procedures  to

particular issue; 

Date/Time: 05-12-10 16:26:21
Job: 550RUL Unit: U$CV Pagination Table: RULES1

1041 RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 
(N)  ordering the presentation of evidence early in the 
trial on a manageable issue that might, on the evidence, 
be  the  basis  for  a  judgment  as  a  matter  of  law  under 
Rule  50(a)  or  a  judgment  on  partial  findings  under 
Rule 52(c); 

(O)  establishing  a  reasonable  limit  on  the  time  al-
lowed to present evidence; and 

(P)  facilitating in other ways the just, speedy, and in-
expensive disposition of the action. 

(d)  Pretrial orders.--After any conference under  this 
rule,  the  court  should  issue  an  order  reciting  the  action 
taken.  This  order  controls  the  course  of  the  action  unless 
the court modifies it. 

(e)  Final pretrial conference and orders.--The court may 
hold  a  final  pretrial  conference  to  formulate  a  trial  plan,  in-
cluding  a  plan  to  facilitate  the  admission  of  evidence.  The 
conference  must  be  held  as  close  to  the  start  of  trial  as  is 
reasonable,  and  must  be  attended  by  at  least  one  attorney 
who will conduct the trial for each party and by any unrepre-
sented party.  The  court may  modify  the  order  issued  after 
a final pretrial conference only to prevent manifest injustice. 

( f )  Sanctions. 

(1)  In general.--On motion or on its own, the court may 
issue  any  just  orders,  including  those  authorized  by  Rule

(A)  fails  to  appear  at  a  scheduling  or  other  pretrial 
conference; 

(B)  is substantially  unprepared  to  participate--or 
does not participate in good faith--in the conference; or 

(C)  fails  to  obey  a  scheduling  or  other  pretrial  order. 

(2)  Imposing  fees  and  costs.--Instead  of  or  in  addition 
to  any  other  sanction,  the  court  must  order  the  party,  its 
attorney,  or  both  to  pay  the  reasonable  expenses--includ-
ing  attorney's  fees--incurred  because  of  any  noncompli-
ance with this rule, unless the noncompliance was substan-
tially  justified  or  other  circumstances  make  an  award  of 
expenses unjust.

(d)  Public  officer's  title  and  name.--A  public  officer  who

alternative claims, as many claims as it has against an oppos-
ing party. 

(b)  Joinder  of  contingent  claims.--A  party  may  join  two 
claims even though one of them is contingent on the disposi-
tion  of  the  other;  but  the  court  may  grant  relief  only  in  ac-
cordance  with  the  parties'  relative  substantive  rights.  In 
particular, a plaintiff may state a claim for money and a claim

to set aside a conveyance that is fraudulent as to that plain-
tiff, without first obtaining a judgment for the money. 

Rule 19.  Required joinder of parties. 

(a)  Persons required to be joined if feasible. 

(1)  Required party.--A person who is subject to service 
of process and whose joinder will not deprive the court of 
subject-matter jurisdiction must be joined as a party if: 

(A)  in  that  person's  absence,  the  court  cannot  accord 
complete relief among existing parties; or 

(B)  that person claims an interest relating to the sub-
ject of the action and is so situated that disposing of the 
action in the person's absence may: 

(i)  as  a  practical  matter  impair  or  impede  the  per-
son's ability to protect the interest; or 

(ii)  leave  an  existing  party  subject  to  a  substantial 
risk of incurring double, multiple, or otherwise incon-
sistent obligations because of the interest. 

(2)  Joinder  by  court  order.--If  a  person  has  not  been 
joined  as  required,  the  court  must  order  that  the  person 
be made a party.  A person who refuses to join as a plain-
tiff  may  be  made  either  a  defendant  or,  in  a  proper  case, 
an involuntary plaintiff. 

(3)  Venue.--If  a  joined  party  objects  to  venue  and  the 
joinder  would  make  venue  improper,  the  court  must  dis-
miss that party. 

(b)  When  joinder  is  not  feasible.--If  a  person  who  is  re-
quired  to  be  joined  if  feasible  cannot  be  joined,  the  court 
must determine whether, in equity and good conscience, the 
action  should  proceed  among  the  existing  parties  or  should 
be dismissed.  The factors for the court to consider include: 

(1)  the extent to which a judgment rendered in the per-
son's  absence  might  prejudice  that  person  or  the  existing 
parties; 

(2)  the extent to which any  prejudice could be lessened 
or avoided by:

1045 RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 
(A)  protective provisions in the judgment; 
(B)  shaping the relief; or 
(C)  other measures; 

(3)  whether  a  judgment  rendered  in  the  person's  ab-
sence would be adequate; and 

(4)  whether  the  plaintiff  would  have  an  adequate  rem-
edy if the action were dismissed for nonjoinder. 

(c)  Pleading the reasons for nonjoinder.--When asserting 
a claim for relief, a party must state: 

(1)  the name, if known, of any person who is required to 
be joined if feasible but is not joined; and 

(2)  the reasons for not joining that person. 

(d)  Exception  for  class  actions.--This  rule  is  subject  to 
Rule 23. 

Rule 20.  Permissive joinder of parties. 

(a)  Persons who may join or be joined. 

(1)  Plainti ffs.--Persons may join in one  acti on  as 
plaintiffs if: 

(A)  they assert any right to relief jointly, severally, or 
in  the  alternative  with  respect  to  or  arising  out  of  the 
same  transaction,  occurrence,  or  series  of  transactions 
or occurrences; and 

(B)  any question of law or fact common to all plaintiffs 
will arise in the action. 

(2)  Defendants.--Persons--as well as a vessel, cargo, or 
other  property  subject  to  admiralty  process  in  rem--may 
be joined in one action as defendants if: 

(A)  any right to relief is asserted against them jointly, 
severally, or in the alternative with respect to or arising 
out  of  the  same  transaction,  occurrence,  or  series  of 
transactions or occurrences; and 

(B)  any question of law or fact common to all defend-
ants will arise in the action. 

(3)  Extent of relief.--Neither a plaintiff nor a defendant 
need  be  interested  in  obtaining  or  defending  against  all 

Date/Time: 05-12-10 16:26:21

1046  RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 

the  relief  demanded.  The  court  may  grant  judgment  to 
one or more plaintiffs  according to their  rights, and 
against  one  or  more  defendants  according  to  their 

liabilities. 

(b)  Protective  measures.--The  court  may  issue  orders-- 
including  an  order  for  separate  trials--to  protect  a  party 
against  embarrassment,  delay,  expense,  or  other  prejudice 
that  arises  from  including  a  person  against  whom  the  party 
asserts  no  claim  and  who  asserts  no  claim  against  the 
party. 

Rule 21.  Misjoinder and nonjoinder of parties. 

Misjoinder of parties is not  a ground for dismissing an ac-
tion.  On  motion  or  on  its  own,  the  court  may  at  any  time, 
on  just  terms,  add  or  drop  a  party.  The  court  may  also 
sever any claim against a party. 

Rule 22.  Interpleader. 

(a)  Grounds. 

(1)  By  a  plaintiff.--Persons  with  claims  that  may  ex-
pose a plaintiff to double or multiple liability may be joined 
as  defendants  and  required  to  interplead.  Joinder  for  in-
terpleader is proper even though: 

(A)  the  claims  of  the  several  claimants,  or  the  titles 
on  which  their  claims  depend,  lack  a  common  origin  or 
are  adverse  and  independent  rather  than  identical;  or 

(B)  the plaintiff denies liability  in whole  or in part to 
any or all of the claimants. 

(2)  By a defendant.--A defendant exposed to similar li-
ability  may  seek  interpleader  through  a  crossclaim  or 
counterclaim. 

(b)  Relation  to  other  rules  and  statutes.--This  rule  sup-
plements--and does not limit--the joinder of parties allowed 
by  Rule  20.  The  remedy  this  rule  provides  is  in  addition 
to--and  does  not  supersede  or  limit--the  remedy  provided 
by 28 U. S. C. $$ 1335, 1397, and 2361.  An action under those 
statutes must be conducted under these rules.

1047 RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 
Rule 23.  Class actions. 

(a)  Prerequisites.--One  or  more  members  of  a  class  may 
sue or be sued as representative parties on behalf of all mem-bers only if: 

(1)  the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable; 
(2)  there  are  questions  of  law  or  fact  common  to  the class; 
(3)  the  claims  or  defenses  of  the  representative  parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class; and 
(4)  the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. 

(b)  Types  of  class  actions.--A  class  action  may  be  main-tained if Rule 23(a) is satisfied and if: 

(1)  prosecuting separate actions by or against individual class members would create a risk of: 

(A)  inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual class members that would establish incom-
patible  standards  of  conduct  for  the  party  opposing  the 
class; or (B)  adjudications with respect to individual class 

members  that,  as  a  practical  matter,  would  be  disposi-tive of the interests of the other members not parties to 
the  individual  adjudications  or  would  substantially  im-
pair or impede their ability to protect their interests; 

(2)  the  party opposing  the  class has acted  or refused  to 
act  on  grounds  that  apply  generally  to  the  class,  so  that 
final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is 
appropriate respecting the class as a whole; or 

(3)  the court finds that the questions of law or fact com-
mon  to  class  members  predominate  over  any  questions 
affecting  only  individual  members,  and  that  a  class  action 
is  superior  to  other  available  methods  for  fairly  and  effi-
ciently  adjudicating  the  controversy.  The  matters  perti-
nent to these findings include: 

(A)  the  class  members'  interests  in  individually  con-
trolling  the  prosecution  or  defense  of  separate  actions; 

Date/Time: 05-12-10 16:26:21
Job: 550RUL Unit: U$CV Pagination Table: RULES1

1048  RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 

(B)  the  extent  and  nature  of  any  litigation  concern-
ing  the  controversy  already  begun  by  or  against  class 
members; 

(C)  the  desirability  or undesirability  of concentrating 
the  litigation  of  the  claims  in  the  particular  forum;  and 

(D)  the  likely  difficulties  in  managing  a  class  action. 

(c)  Certification  order;  notice  to  class  members;  judg-
ment; issues classes; subclasses. 

(1)  Certification order. 

(A)  Time to issue.--At an early practicable time after 
a  person  sues  or  is  sued  as  a  class  representative,  the 
court  must  determine  by  order  whether  to  certify  the 
action as a class action. 

(B)  Defining the class; appointing class counsel.--An 
order  that  certifies  a  class  action  must  define  the  class 
and  the  class  claims,  issues,  or  defenses,  and  must  ap-
point class counsel under Rule 23(g). 

(C)  Altering  or  amending  the  order.--An  order  that 
grants  or  denies  class  certification  may  be  altered  or 
amended before final judgment. 

(2)  Notice. 

(A)  For  (b)(1)  or  (b)(2)  classes.--For  any  class  certi-
fied  under  Rule  23(b)(1)  or  (b)(2),  the  court  may  direct 
appropriate notice to the class. 

(B)  For  (b)(3)  classes.--For  any  class  certified  under 
Rule 23(b)(3), the court must direct to class members the 
best  notice  that  is  practicable  under  the  circumstances, 
including  individual  notice  to  all  members  who  can  be 
identified  through  reasonable  effort.  The  notice  must 
clearly  and  concisely  state  in  plain,  easily  understood 
language: 

(i)  the nature of the action; 
(ii)  the definition of the class certified; 
(iii)  the class claims, issues, or defenses; 
(iv)  that  a  class  member  may  enter  an  appearance 
through an attorney if the member so desires; 

Date/Time: 05-12-10 16:26:21

1049 RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 
(v)  that  the  court  will  exclude  from  the  class  any 
member who requests exclusion; 

(vi)  the  time  and  manner  for  requesting  exclusion; 
and 

(vii)  the binding effect of a class judgment on mem-
bers under Rule 23(c)(3). 

(3)  Judgment.--Whether  or  not  favorable  to  the  class, 
the judgment in a class action must: 

(A)  for  any  class  certified  under  Rule  23(b)(1)  or 
(b)(2),  include  and  describe  those  whom  the  court  finds 
to be class members; and 

(B)  for any class certified under Rule 23(b)(3), include 
and  specify or describe  those to whom  the  Rule  23(c)(2) 
notice  was  directed,  who  have  not  requested  exclusion, 
and whom the court finds to be class members. 

(4)  Particular  issues.--When  appropriate,  an  action 
may  be  brought  or  maintained  as  a  class  action  with  re-
spect to particular issues. 

(5)  Subclasses.--When  appropriate,  a  class  may  be  di-
vided into subclasses that are each treated as a class under 
this rule. 

(d)  Conducting the action. 

(1)  In general.--In conducting an action under this rule, 
the court may issue orders that: 

(A)  determine the  course  of proceedings or prescribe 
measures to prevent undue repetition or complication in 
presenting evidence or argument; 

(B)  require--to protect class members and fairly con-
duct the action--giving appropriate notice to some or all 
class members of: 

(i)  any step in the action; 
(ii)  the proposed extent of the judgment; or 
(iii)  the  members'  opportunity  to  signify  whether 
they  consider  the  representation  fair  and  adequate, 
to  intervene  and  present  claims  or  defenses,  or  to 
otherwise come into the action; 

Date/Time: 05-12-10 16:26:21

1050  RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 

(C)  impose conditions on the representative parties or on intervenors; 

(D)  require  that  the  pleadings  be  amended  to  elimi-nate  allegations  about  representation  of  absent  persons 
and that the action proceed accordingly; or (E)  deal with similar procedural matters. 

(2)  Combining  and  amending  orders.--An  order  under Rule 23(d)(1) may be altered or amended from time to time 
and may be combined with an order under Rule 16. 
(e)  Settlement,  voluntary  dismissal,  or  compromise.-- 
The  claims,  issues,  or  defenses  of  a  certified  class  may  be settled, voluntarily dismissed, or compromised only with the 

court's  approval.  The  following  procedures  apply  to  a  pro-posed settlement, voluntary dismissal, or compromise: 

(1)  The court must direct notice in a reasonable manner to all class members who would be bound by the proposal. 
(2)  If the proposal would bind class members, the court may  approve it only  after  a hearing  and on  finding that  it 
is fair, reasonable, and adequate. 

(3)  The  parties  seeking  approval  must  file  a  statement identifying  any  agreement  made  in  connection  with  the 

proposal. (4)  If  the  class  action  was  previously  certified  under 
Rule  23(b)(3),  the  court  may  refuse  to  approve  a  settle-
ment unless it affords a new opportunity to request exclu-
sion to individual class members who had an earlier oppor-
tunity to request exclusion but did not do so. 

(5)  Any  class  member  may  object  to  the  proposal  if  it 
requires court approval  under this  subdivision (e); the ob-
jection  may  be  withdrawn  only  with  the  court's  approval. 

( f )  Appeals.--A  court  of  appeals  may  permit  an  appeal 
from  an  order  granting  or  denying  class-action  certification 
under  this  rule  if  a  petition  for  permission  to  appeal  is  filed 
with  the  circuit  clerk  within  10  days  after  the  order  is  en-
tered.  An  appeal  does  not  stay  proceedings  in  the  district 
court  unless  the  district  judge  or  the  court  of  appeals  so 
orders.

1051 RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 
( g)  Class counsel. 

(1)  Appointing  class  counsel.--Unless  a  statute  pro-
vides otherwise, a court that certifies a class must appoint 
class counsel.  In appointing class counsel, the court: 

(A)  must consider: 

(i)  the  work  counsel  has  done  in  identifying  or  in-
vestigating potential claims in the action; 

(ii)  counsel's  experience  in  handling  class  actions, 
other  complex  litigation,  and  the  types  of  claims  as-
serted in the action; 

(iii)  counsel's knowledge of the applicable law; and 
(iv)  the resources that counsel will commit to repre-
senting the class; 

(B)  may consider any other matter pertinent to coun-
sel's ability to fairly and adequately represent the inter-
ests of the class; 

(C)  may order potential class counsel to provide infor-
mation on any subject pertinent to the appointment and 
to  propose  terms  for  attorney's  fees  and  nontaxable 
costs; 

(D)  may  include  in  the  appointing  order  provisions 
about  the  award  of  attorney's  fees  or  nontaxable  costs 
under Rule 23(h); and 

(E)  may  make  further  orders  in  connection  with  the 
appointment. 

(2)  Standard  for  appointing  class  counsel.--When  one 
applicant  seeks  appointment  as  class  counsel,  the  court 
may appoint that applicant only if the applicant is adequate 
under  Rule  23(g)(1)  and  (4).  If  more  than  one  adequate 
applicant  seeks  appointment,  the  court  must  appoint  the 
applicant  best  able  to  represent  the  interests  of  the  class. 

(3)  Interim counsel.--The court may designate interim 
counsel  to  act  on  behalf  of  a  putative  class  before  deter-
mining whether to certify the action as a class action. 

(4)  Duty  of  class  counsel.--Class  counsel  must  fairly 
and adequately represent the interests of the class.

1052  RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 

(h)  Attorney's  fees  and  nontaxable  costs.--In  a  certified 
class action, the court may  award reasonable attorney's fees 
and  nontaxable  costs  that  are  authorized  by  law  or  by  the 
parties' agreement.  The following procedures apply: 

(1)  A claim for an award must be made by motion under 
Rule  54(d)(2), subject  to  the  provisions  of this  subdivision 
(h),  at  a  time  the  court  sets.  Notice  of  the  motion  must 
be  served on  all parties  and,  for motions  by  class  counsel, 
directed to class members in a reasonable manner. 

(2)  A  class  member,  or  a  party  from  whom  payment  is 
sought, may object to the motion. 

(3)  The court may hold a hearing and must find the facts 
and state its legal conclusions under Rule 52(a). 

(4)  The court may  refer  issues related to  the amount  of 
the  award  to  a  special  master  or  a  magistrate  judge,  as 
provided in Rule 54(d)(2)(D). 

Rule 23.1.  Derivative actions. 

(a)  Prerequisites.--This  rule  applies  when  one  or  more 
shareholders  or  members  of  a  corporation  or  an  unincorpo-
rated association bring a derivative action to enforce a right 
that  the  corporation  or  association  may  properly  assert  but 
has  failed  to  enforce.  The  derivative  action  may  not  be 
maintained if it appears that the plaintiff does not fairly and 
adequately  represent  the  interests  of  shareholders  or  mem-
bers who  are  similarly situated in  enforcing  the  right  of the 
corporation or association. 

(b)  Pleading  requirements.--The  complaint  must  be  veri-
fied and must: 

(1)  allege  that  the  plaintiff  was  a  shareholder  or  mem-
ber  at  the  time  of  the  transaction  complained  of,  or  that 
the plaintiff 's share or membership later devolved on it by 
operation of law; 

(2)  allege that the action is not a collusive one to confer 
jurisdiction that the court would otherwise lack; and 

(3)  state with particularity: 

Date/Time: 05-12-10 16:26:21
Job: 550RUL Unit: U$CV Pagination Table: RULES1

1053 RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 
(A)  any  effort  by  the  plaintiff  to  obtain  the  desired 
action  from  the  directors  or  comparable  authority  and, 
if necessary, from the shareholders or members; and 

(B)  the  reasons  for  not  obtaining  the  action  or  not 
making the effort. 

(c)  Settlement, dismissal, and compromise.--A derivative 
action may be settled, voluntarily dismissed, or compromised 
only with the court's approval.  Notice of a proposed settle-
ment,  voluntary  dismissal,  or  compromise  must  be  given 
to  shareholders  or  members  in  the  manner  that  the  court 
orders. 

Rule 23.2.  Actions relating to unincorporated associations. 

This  rule  applies  to  an  action  brought  by  or  against  the 
members of an unincorporated association as a class by nam-
ing  certain  members  as  representative  parties.  The  action 
may  be  maintained  only  if  it  appears  that  those  parties  will 
fairly and adequately protect the interests of the association 
and  its  members.  In  conducting  the  action,  the  court  may 
issue  any  appropriate  orders  corresponding  with  those  in 
Rule  23(d),  and  the  procedure  for  settlement,  voluntary  dis-
missal,  or  compromise  must  correspond  with  the  procedure 
in Rule 23(e). 

Rule 24.  Intervention. 

(a)  Intervention  of  right.--On  timely  motion,  the  court 
must permit anyone to intervene who: 

(1)  is given an unconditional right to intervene by a fed-
eral statute; or 

(2)  claims an  interest  relating to  the property  or trans-
action  that  is  the  subject  of  the  action,  and  is  so  situated 
that  disposing  of  the  action  may  as  a  practical  matter 
impair  or  impede  the  movant's  ability  to  protect  its  in-
terest,  unless  existing  parties  adequately  represent  that 
interest. 

(b)  Permissive intervention. 

Date/Time: 05-12-10 16:26:21
Job: 550RUL Unit: U$CV Pagination Table: RULES1

1054  RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 

(1)  In  general.--On  timely  motion,  the  court  may  per-mit anyone to intervene who: 

(A)  is given a conditional right to intervene by a fed-eral statute; or 
(B)  has  a  claim  or  defense  that  shares  with  the  main action a common question of law or fact. 

(2)  By a  government officer  or  agency.--On  timely mo-tion, the court may permit a federal or state governmental 
officer or agency to intervene if a party's claim or defense is based on: 

(A)  a  statute  or  executive  order  administered  by  the 
officer or agency; or 

(B)  any regulation,  order, requirement, or agreement 
issued or made under the statute or executive order. 

(3)  Delay or prejudice.--In exercising its discretion, the 
court  must  consider  whether  the  intervention  will  unduly 
delay  or  prejudice  the  adjudication  of  the  original  par-
ties' rights. 

(c)  Notice and pleading required.--A motion to intervene 
must  be  served  on  the  parties  as  provided  in  Rule  5.  The 
motion  must  state  the  grounds  for  intervention  and  be  ac-
companied  by  a  pleading  that  sets  out  the  claim  or  defense 
for which intervention is sought. 

Rule 25.  Substitution of parties. 

(a)  Death. 

(1)  Substitution  if  the  claim  is  not  extinguished.--If  a 
party dies and the claim is not extinguished, the court may 
order substitution of the proper party.  A motion for sub-
stitution  may  be  made  by  any  party  or  by  the  decedent's 
successor  or  representative.  If  the  motion  is  not  made 
within  90  days  after  service  of  a  statement  noting  the 
death,  the  action  by  or  against  the  decedent  must  be 
dismissed. 

(2)  Continuation among the remaining parties.--After 
a party's death, if the right sought to be enforced survives 
only  to  or  against  the  remaining  parties,  the  action  does

1055 RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 
not  abate,  but  proceeds  in  favor  of  or  against  the  remain-ing parties.  The death should be noted on the record. 

(3)  Service.--A  motion  to  substitute,  together  with  a notice  of  hearing,  must  be  served  on  the  parties  as  pro-
vided  in  Rule  5  and  on  nonparties  as  provided  in  Rule  4. A  statement  noting  death  must  be  served  in  the  same 
manner.  Service may be made in any judicial district. 
(b)  Incompetency.--If  a  party  becomes  incompetent,  the court  may,  on  motion,  permit  the  action  to  be  continued  by 

or  against  the  party's  representative.  The  motion  must  be served as provided in Rule 25(a)(3). 

(c)  Transfer of interest.--If an interest is transferred, the action may be continued by or against the original party un-
less the court, on motion, orders the transferee to be substi-tuted  in  the  action  or  joined  with  the  original  party.  The 
motion must be served as provided in Rule 25(a)(3). (d)  Public  officers;  death  or  separation  from  office.--An 
action does not abate when a public officer who is a party in an official capacity dies,  resigns, or otherwise  ceases to hold 
office  while  the  action  is  pending.  The  officer's  successor is  automatically  substituted  as  a  party.  Later  proceedings 
should be in the substituted party's name, but any misnomer not  affecting  the  parties'  substantial  rights  must  be  disre-
garded.  The  court  may  order  substitution  at  any  time,  but the absence of such an order does not affect the substitution.

(iii)  a  computation  of  each  category  of  damages 
claimed by the disclosing party--who must also make 
available for inspection and copying as under Rule 34 
the  documents  or  other  evidentiary  material,  unless 
privileged or protected from disclosure, on which each 
computation  is  based,  including  materials  bearing  on 
the nature and extent of injuries suffered; and 

(iv)  for  inspection  and  copying  as  under  Rule  34, 
any  insurance  agreement  under  which  an  insurance 
business may be liable to satisfy all or part of a possi-
ble  judgment  in  the  action  or  to  indemnify  or  reim-
burse for payments made to satisfy the judgment. 

(B)  Proceedings  exempt  from  initial  disclosure.-- 
The following proceedings are exempt from initial 
disclosure: 

(i)  an action for review on an administrative record; 
(ii)  a  petition  for  habeas  corpus  or  any  other  pro-
ceeding to challenge a criminal conviction or sentence; 

(iii)  an  action  brought  without  an  attorney  by  a

1057 RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 
(vii)  a  proceeding  ancillary  to  a  proceeding  in  an-
other court; and 

(viii)  an action to enforce an arbitration award. 

(C)  Time for ini tial  disclosures--in  general.--A 
party  must  make  the  initial  disclosures  at  or  within  14 
days  after  the  parties'  Rule  26(f )  conference  unless  a 
different  time  is  set  by  stipulation  or  court  order,  or 
unless a party objects during the conference that initial 
disclosures are not appropriate in this action and states 
the objection in the proposed discovery plan.  In ruling 
on  the objection,  the court  must determine what disclo-
sures,  if  any,  are  to  be  made  and  must  set  the  time  for 
disclosure. 

(D)  Time  for  initial  disclosures--for  parties  served 
or  joined  later.--A  party  that  is  first  served  or  other-
wise  joined  after  the  Rule  26(f )  conference  must  make 
the initial disclosures within 30 days after being served 
or joined, unless a different time is set by stipulation or 
court order. 

(E)  Basis  for  initial  disclosure;  unacceptable  ex-
cuses.--A  party  must  make  its  initial  disclosures  based 
on  the  information  then  reasonably  available  to  it.  A 
party is not excused from making its disclosures because 
it  has  not  fully  investigated  the  case  or because  it  chal-
lenges  the  sufficiency  of  another  party's  disclosures  or 
because another party has not made its disclosures. 

(2)  Disclosure of expert testimony. 

(A)  In  general.--In  addition  to  the  disclosures  re-
quired  by  Rule  26(a)(1),  a  party  must  disclose  to  the 
other  parties  the  identity  of  any  witness  it  may  use  at 
trial  to  present  evidence  under  Federal  Rule  of  Evi-
dence 702, 703, or 705. 

(B)  Written  report.--Unless  otherwise  stipulated  or 
ordered  by  the  court,  this  disclosure  must  be  accompa-
nied  by  a  written  report--prepared  and  signed  by  the 
witness--if  the  witness  is  one  retained  or  specially  em-
ployed  to  provide  expert  testimony  in  the  case  or  one

1058  RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 

whose  duties  as  the  party's  employee  regularly  involve 
giving expert testimony.  The report must contain: 

(i)  a complete statement of all opinions the witness 
will express and the basis and reasons for them; 

(ii)  the data or other information considered by the 
witness in forming them; 

(iii)  any exhibits that will be used to summarize or 
support them; 

(iv)  the  witness's  qualifications,  including  a  list  of 
all  publications  authored  in  the  previous  ten  years; 

(v)  a list of all other cases in which, during the pre-
vious four years, the witness testified as an expert at 
trial or by deposition; and 

(vi)  a  statement  of  the  compensation  to  be  paid  for 
the study and testimony in the case. 

(C)  Time to disclose expert testimony.--A party must 
make these disclosures at the times and in the sequence 
that  the  court  orders.  Absent  a  stipulation  or  a  court 
order, the disclosures must be made: 

(i)  at  least  90  days  before  the  date  set  for  trial  or 
for the case to be ready for trial; or 

(ii)  if  the  evidence  is  intended  solely  to  contradict 
or  rebut  evidence  on  the  same  subject  matter  identi-
fied  by  another  party  under  Rule  26(a)(2)(B),  within 
30 days after the other party's disclosure. 

(D)  Supplementing the disclosure.--The parties must 
supplement these disclosures when required under 
Rule 26(e). 

(3)  Pretrial disclosures. 

(A)  In  general.--In  addition  to  the  disclosures  re-
quired by Rule 26(a)(1) and (2), a party must provide to 
the  other  parties  and  promptly  file  the  following  infor-
mation  about  the  evidence  that  it  may  present  at  trial 
other than solely for impeachment: 

(i)  the name and, if not previously provided, the ad-
dress  and  telephone  number  of  each  witness--sepa-

1059 RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 
rately  identifying  those  the  party  expects  to  present and those it may call if the need arises; 

(ii)  the  designation  of  those  witnesses  whose  testi-mony the party expects to present by deposition and, 
if not taken stenographically, a transcript of the perti-nent parts of the deposition; and 

(iii)  an identification  of each document or  other ex-hibit,  including  summaries  of  other  evidence--sepa-
rately  identifying  those  items  the  party  expects  to offer and those it may offer if the need arises. 

(B)  Time for pretrial disclosures; objections.--Unless the  court  orders  otherwise,  these  disclosures  must  be 
made at least 30 days before trial.  Within 14 days after they  are  made,  unless  the  court  sets  a  different  time,  a 
party may serve and promptly file a list of the following 
objections:  any  objections  to  the  use  under  Rule  32(a) of a deposition designated by  another party under Rule 

26(a)(3)(A)(ii);  and  any  objection,  together  with  the grounds  for  it,  that  may  be  made  to  the  admissibility 
of  materials  identified  under  Rule  26(a)(3)(A)(iii).  An objection  not  so  made--except  for  one  under  Federal 
Rule  of  Evidence  402  or  403--is  waived  unless  excused by the court for good cause. 

(4)  Form  of  disclosures.--Unless  the  court  orders  oth-
erwise, all disclosures under Rule 26(a) must be in writing, 
signed, and served. 

(b)  Discovery scope and limits. 

(1)  Scope in general.--Unless otherwise limited by 
court  order,  the  scope  of  discovery  is  as  follows:  Parties 
may obtain discovery regarding any nonprivileged matter 
that is relevant to any party's claim or defense--including 
the  existence,  description,  nature,  custody,  condition,  and 
location of any documents or other tangible things and the 
identity and location of persons who know of any discover-
able matter.  For good cause, the court may order discov-
ery  of  any matter  relevant  to  the  subject  matter  involved 
in  the  action.  Relevant  information  need  not  be  admissi-

Date/Time: 05-12-10 16:26:21
Job: 550RUL Unit: U$CV Pagination Table: RULES1

1060  RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 

ble  at  the  trial  if  the  discovery  appears  reasonably  calcu-lated to lead  to the  discovery  of admissible evidence.  All 

discovery  is  subject  to  the  limitations  imposed  by  Rule 26(b)(2)(C). 

(2)  Limitations on frequency and extent. (

A)  When  permitted.--By  order,  the  court  may  alter 
the  limits  in  these  rules  on  the  number  of  depositions and interrogatories or on the length of depositions under 

Rule 30.  By order or local rule, the court may also limit the number of requests under Rule 36. 

(B)  Specific  limitations  on  electronically  stored  in-
formation.--A party need not provide discovery of elec-tronically  stored  information  from  sources  that  the 

party  identifies  as  not  reasonably  accessible  because  of undue  burden  or  cost.  On  motion  to  compel  discovery 
or  for  a  protective  order,  the  party  from  whom  discov-ery is sought must show that the information is not rea-
sonably  accessible  because  of  undue  burden  or  cost.  If that  showing  is  made,  the  court  may  nonetheless  order 
discovery  from  such  sources  if  the  requesting  party shows  good  cause,  considering  the  limitations  of  Rule 
26(b)(2)(C).  The  court  may  specify  conditions  for  the discovery. 

(C)  When  required.--On  motion  or  on  its  own,  the 
court  must  limit  the  frequency  or  extent  of  discovery otherwise  allowed  by  these  rules  or  by  local  rule  if  it 

determines that: (i)  the discovery sought is unreasonably cumulative 

or  duplicative,  or  can  be  obtained  from  some  other source  that  is  more  convenient,  less  burdensome,  or 
less expensive; (ii)  the  party  seeking  discovery  has  had  ample  op-
portunity  to  obtain  the  information  by  discovery  in the action; or 

(iii)  the burden  or  expense  of  the  proposed  discov-
ery outweighs its likely benefit, considering the needs 
of  the  case,  the  amount  in  controversy,  the  parties' 
resources, the importance of the issues at stake in the 

Date/Time: 05-12-10 16:26:21

1061 RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 
action, and the importance of the  discovery in resolv-ing the issues. 

(3)  Trial preparation: materials. (

A)  Documents  and  tangible  things.--Ordinarily,  a 
party  may  not  discover  documents  and  tangible  things that are prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial 

by  or  for  another  party  or  its  representative  (including the  other  party's  attorney,  consultant,  surety,  indemni-
tor,  insurer,  or  agent).  But,  subject  to  Rule  26(b)(4), those materials may be discovered if: 

(i)  they are  otherwise discoverable under  Rule 26(b)(1); and 
(ii)  the party shows that it has substantial need for the  materials  to  prepare  its  case  and  cannot,  without 
undue hardship, obtain their substantial equivalent by 
other means. 

(B)  Protection  against  disclosure.--If  the  court  or-ders  discovery  of  those  materials,  it  must  protect 

against  disclosure  of  the  mental  impressions,  conclu-
sions, opinions, or legal theories of a party's attorney or other representative concerning the litigation. 

(C)  Previous  statement.--Any  party  or  other  person may,  on  request  and  without  the  required  showing,  ob-
tain  the  person's  own  previous  statement  about  the  ac-
tion or its subject matter.  If the request is refused, the 
person  may  move  for  a  court  order,  and  Rule  37(a)(5) 
applies  to  the  award  of  expenses.  A  previous  state-
ment is either: 

(i)  a  written  statement  that  the  person  has  signed 
or otherwise adopted or approved; or 

(ii)  a  contemporaneous  stenographic,  mechanical, 
electrical,  or  other  recording--or  a  transcription  of 
it--that  recites  substantially  verbatim  the  person's 
oral statement. 

(4)  Trial preparation: experts. 

(A)  Expert  who  may  testify.--A  party  may  depose 
any  person  who  has  been  identified  as  an  expert  whose

Job: 550RUL Unit: U$CV Pagination Table: RULES1

1062  RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 

opinions  may  be  presented  at  trial.  If  Rule  26(a)(2)(B) requires  a  report  from  the  expert,  the  deposition  may 

be conducted only after the report is provided. (

B)  Expert  employed  only  for  trial  preparation.-- 
Ordinarily,  a  party  may  not,  by  interrogatories  or deposition,  discover  facts  known  or  opinions  held  by  an 

expert  who  has  been  retained  or  specially  employed  by another  party  in  anticipation  of  litigation  or  to  prepare 
for  trial  and  who  is  not  expected  to  be  called  as  a  wit-ness at trial.  But a party may do so only: 

(i)  as provided in Rule 35(b); or 
(ii)  on  showing  exceptional  circumstances  under which  it  is  impracticable  for  the  party  to  obtain  facts 

or opinions on the same subject by other means. 
(C)  Payment.--Unless  manifest  injustice  would  re-
sult,  the  court  must  require  that  the  party  seeking discovery: 

(i)  pay  the  expert  a  reasonable  fee  for  time  spent in  responding  to  discovery  under  Rule  26(b)(4)(A)  or 
(B); and (ii)  for discovery under (B), also pay the other party 
a  fair  portion  of  the  fees  and  expenses  it  reasonably incurred  in  obtaining  the  expert's  facts  and  opinions. 

(5)  Claiming  privilege  or  protecting  trial-preparation 
materials. 

(A)  Information  withheld.--When  a  party  withholds information  otherwise  discoverable  by  claiming  that 

the information is privileged or subject to protection as trial-preparation material, the party must: 

(i)  expressly make the claim; and 
(ii)  describe the nature of the documents, communi-cations, or tangible things not produced or disclosed-- 

and do so in a manner that, without revealing informa-tion  itself  privileged  or  protected,  will  enable  other 
parties to assess the claim. 
(B)  Information  produced.--If  information  produced 
in  discovery  is  subject  to  a  claim  of  privilege  or  of  pro-
tection  as  trial-preparation  material,  the  party  making 

Date/Time: 05-12-10 16:26:21
Job: 550RUL Unit: U$CV Pagination Table: RULES1

1063 RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 
the  claim  may  notify  any  party  that  received  the  infor-
mation  of  the  claim  and  the  basis  for  it.  After  being 
notified, a party must promptly return, sequester, or de-
stroy  the  specified  information  and  any  copies  it  has; 
must  not  use  or  disclose  the  information  until the  claim 
is  resolved;  must  take  reasonable  steps  to  retrieve  the 
information  if  the  party  disclosed  it  before  being  noti-
fied;  and  may  promptly  present  the  information  to  the 
court  under seal  for  a  determination of  the  claim.  The 
producing party must preserve the information until the 
claim is resolved. 

(c)  Protective orders. 

(1)  In general.--A party  or any person from  whom dis-
covery  is  sought  may  move  for  a  protective  order  in  the 
court where the action is pending--or as an alternative on 
matters  relating  to  a  deposition,  in  the  court  for  the  dis-
trict  where  the  deposition  will  be  taken.  The  motion 
must  include  a  certification  that  the  movant  has  in  good 
faith  conferred or attempted to confer with  other affected 
parties  in  an  effort  to  resolve  the  dispute  without  court 
action.  The  court  may,  for  good  cause,  issue  an  order  to 
protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, 
oppression,  or  undue  burden  or  expense,  including  one  or 
more of the following: 

(A)  forbidding the disclosure or discovery; 
(B)  specifying terms, including time and place, for the 
disclosure or discovery; 

(C)  prescribing a discovery method other than the one 
selected by the party seeking discovery; 

(D)  forbidding inquiry into certain matters, or limiting 
the  scope  of  disclosure  or  discovery  to  certain  matters; 

(E)  designating  the  persons  who  may  be  present 
while the discovery is conducted; 

(F)  requiring  that  a  deposition  be  sealed  and  opened 
only on court order; 

(G)  requiring that a trade secret or other confidential 
research,  development,  or  commercial  information  not 
be  revealed  or  be  revealed  only  in  a  specified  way;  and 

Date/Time: 05-12-10 16:26:21
Job: 550RUL Unit: U$CV Pagination Table: RULES1

1064  RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 

(H)  requiring that the parties simultaneously file specified  documents  or  information  in  sealed  envelopes, 

to be opened as the court directs. 
(2)  Ordering  discovery.--If  a  motion  for  a  protective order  is  wholly  or  partly  denied,  the  court  may,  on  just 

terms,  order  that  any  party  or  person  provide  or  permit discovery. 

(3)  Awarding  expenses.--Rule  37(a)(5)  applies  to  the award of expenses. 

(d)  Timing and sequence of discovery. (

1)  Timing.--A party  may not  seek  discovery  from any source  before  the  parties  have  conferred  as  required  by 

Rule  26(f),  except  in  a  proceeding  exempted  from  initial disclosure  under  Rule  26(a)(1)(B),  or  when  authorized  by 
these rules, by stipulation, or by court order. (2)  Sequence.--Unless,  on  motion,  the  court  orders  oth-
erwise  for  the  parties'  and  witnesses'  convenience  and  in the interests of justice: 

(A)  methods  of  discovery  may  be  used  in  any  se-quence; and 
(B)  discovery by one party does not require any other party to delay its discovery. 

(e)  Supplementing disclosures and responses. (

1)  In  general.--A  party  who  has  made  a  disclosure under  Rule  26(a)--or  who  has  responded  to  an  interroga-

tory,  request  for  production,  or  request  for  admission-- must supplement or correct its disclosure or response: 

(A)  in  a  timely  manner  if  the  party  learns  that  in some  material  respect  the  disclosure  or  response  is 
incomplete  or  incorrect,  and  if  the  additional  or  correc-tive  information  has  not  otherwise  been  made  known 
to  the  other  parties  during  the  discovery  process  or  in 
writing; or (B)  as ordered by the court. 

(2)  Expert  witness.--For  an  expert  whose  report  must 
be  disclosed  under  Rule  26(a)(2)(B),  the  party's  duty  to 
supplement  extends  both  to  information  included  in  the 

Date/Time: 05-12-10 16:26:21

1065 RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 
report and to information g iven dur ing the expert's deposition.  Any  additions  or  changes  to  this  information 

must  be  disclosed  by  the  time  the  party's  pretrial  disclo-sures under Rule 26(a)(3) are due. 

( f )  Conference of the parties; planning for discovery. (1)  Conference  timing.--Except  in  a  proceeding  ex-
empted  from  initial  disclosure  under  Rule  26(a)(1)(B)  or when  the  court  orders  otherwise,  the  parties  must  confer 
as  soon  as  practicable--and  in  any  event  at  least  21  days before a scheduling conference is to be held or a scheduling 
order is due under Rule 16(b). (2)  Conference  content;  parties'  responsibilities.--In 
conferring, the parties must consider the nature and basis of  their  claims  and  defenses  and  the  possibilities  for 
promptly  settling  or  resolving  the  case;  make  or  arrange for  the  disclosures  required  by  Rule  26(a)(1);  discuss  any 
issues  about  preserving  discoverable  information;  and  de-velop a proposed discovery plan.  The attorneys of record 
and  all  unrepresented  parties  that  have  appeared  in  the case  are  jointly  responsible  for  arranging  the  conference, 
for  attempting  in  good  faith to agree  on the  proposed  dis-covery plan, and for submitting to the court within 14 days 
after  the  conference  a  written  report  outlining  the  plan. The court may order the parties or attorneys to attend the 
conference in person. (

3)  Discovery  plan.--A  discovery  plan  must  state  the parties' views and proposals on: 

(A)  what changes should be made in the timing, form, or requirement  for  disclosures  under Rule  26(a), includ-
ing a statement of when initial disclosures were made or will be made; 

(B)  the  subjects  on  which  discovery  may  be  needed, when  discovery  should  be  completed,  and  whether  dis-
covery should be conducted in phases or be limited to or focused on particular issues; 

(C)  any  issues  about  disclosure  or  discovery  of  elec-tronically  stored  information,  including  the  form  or 
forms in which it should be produced; 

Date/Time: 05-12-10 16:26:21
Job: 550RUL Unit: U$CV Pagination Table: RULES1

1066  RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 

(D)  any  issues  about  claims  of  privilege  or  of  protec-
tion as trial-preparation materials, including--if the par-
ties  agree  on  a  procedure  to  assert  these  claims  after 
production--whether  to  ask  the  court  to  include  their 
agreement in an order; 

(E)  what  changes  should  be  made  in  the  limitations 
on discovery imposed under these rules or by local rule, 
and what other limitations should be imposed; and 

(F)  any other orders that the court should issue under 
Rule 26(c) or under Rule 16(b) and (c). 

(4)  Expedited  schedule.--If  necessary  to  comply  with 
its  expedited  schedule  for  Rule  16(b)  conferences,  a  court 
may by local rule: 

(A)  require  the  parties'  conference  to  occur  less  than 
21  days  before  the  scheduling  conference  is  held  or  a 
scheduling order is due under Rule 16(b); and 

(B)  require the written report outlining the discovery 
plan  to  be  filed  less  than  14  days  after  the  parties'  con-
ference, or excuse the parties from submitting a written 
report and permit them to report orally on their discov-
ery plan at the Rule 16(b) conference. 

( g)  Si gning discl osures  and d iscove ry  requests, re-
sponses, and objections. 

(1)  Signature  required;  effect of signature.--Every dis-
closure  under  Rule  26(a)(1)  or  (a)(3)  and  every  discovery 
request, response, or objection  must be  signed by at least 
one attorney of record  in the  attorney's own name--or by 
the party personally, if unrepresented--and must state the 
signer's  address,  e-mail  address,  and  telephone  number. 
By  signing,  an  attorney  or party certifies  that to  the  best 
of  the  person's  knowledge,  information,  and  belief  formed 
after a reasonable inquiry: 

(A)  with  respect  to  a  disclosure,  it  is  complete  and 
correct as of the time it is made; and 

(B)  with  respect  to  a  discovery  request,  response,  or 
objection, it is: 

Date/Time: 05-12-10 16:26:21
Job: 550RUL Unit: U$CV Pagination Table: RULES1

1067 RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 
(i)  consistent with these rules and warranted by ex-
isting  law  or  by  a  nonfrivolous  argument  for  extend-
ing, modifying, or reversing existing law, or for estab-
lishing new law; 

(ii)  not  interposed  for  any  improper  purpose,  such 
as  to  harass,  cause  unnecessary  delay,  or  needlessly 
increase the cost of litigation; and 

(iii)  neither  unreasonable  nor  unduly  burdensome 
or  expensive, considering  the  needs  of the  case, prior 
discovery  in  the  case,  the amount  in  controversy,  and 
the importance of the issues at stake in the action. 

(2)  Failure  to  sign.--Other  parties  have  no  duty  to  act 
on  an  unsigned  disclosure,  request,  response,  or  objection 
until  it  is  signed,  and  the  court  must  strike  it  unless  a 
signature is promptly supplied after the omission is called 
to the attorney's or party's attention. 

(3)  Sanction  for  improper  certification.--If  a  certifica-
tion violates this rule without substantial justification, the 
court, on motion or on its own, must impose an appropriate 
sanction  on  the  signer,  the  party  on  whose  behalf  the 
signer  was  acting,  or  both.  The  sanction  may  include  an 
order to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney's 
fees, caused by the violation. 

Rule 27.  Depositions to perpetuate testimony. 

(a)  Before an action is filed. 

(1)  Petition.--A  person  who  wants  to  perpetuate  testi-
mony about any matter cognizable in a United States court 
may  file  a  verified  petition  in  the  district  court  for  the 
district  where  any  expected  adverse  party  resides.  The 
petition  must  ask  for  an  order  authorizing  the  petitioner 
to  depose  the  named  persons  in  order  to  perpetuate  their 
testimony.  The  petition  must be  titled in the  petitioner's 
name and must show: 

(A)  that  the  petitioner  expects  to  be  a  party  to  an 
action  cognizable  in  a  United  States  court  but  cannot 
presently bring it or cause it to be brought;

(B)  the subject matter of the expected action and the petitioner's interest; 

(C)  the facts that the petitioner wants to establish by the proposed testimony and the reasons to perpetuate it; 
(D)  the  names  or  a  description  of  the  persons  whom the  petitioner  expects  to  be  adverse  parties  and  their 
addresses, so far as known; and (E)  the name, address, and expected substance of the 
testimony of each deponent. 
(2)  Notice  and  service.--At  least  20  days  before  the hearing date, the petitioner must serve each expected ad-

verse party with a copy of the petition and a notice stating the  time  and  place  of  the  hearing.  The  notice  may  be 
served  either  inside  or  outside  the  district  or  state  in  the manner  provided  in  Rule  4.  If  that  service  cannot  be 
made  with  reasonable  diligence  on  an  expected  adverse party, the court may order service by publication or other-
wise.  The  court  must  appoint  an  attorney  to  represent persons  not  served  in  the  manner  provided  in  Rule  4  and 
to cross-examine the deponent if an unserved person is not otherwise represented.  If  any  expected  adverse  party is 
a minor or is incompetent, Rule 17(c) applies. (3)  Order  and  examination.--If  satisfied  that  perpet-
uating  the  testimony  may  prevent  a  failure  or  delay  of justice,  the  court  must  issue  an  order  that  designates  or 
describes  the  persons  whose  depositions  may  be  taken, specifies  the  subject  matter  of  the  examinations,  and 
states  whether  the  depositions  will  be  taken  orally  or  by written  interrogatories.  The  depositions  may  then  be 
taken  under  these  rules,  and  the  court  may  issue  orders like  those authorized  by Rules 34 and 35.  A reference in 
these rules to the court where an action is pending means, for  purposes  of  this  rule,  the  court  where  the  petition  for 
the deposition was filed. (

4)  Using  the  deposition.--A  deposition  to  perpetuate testimony may  be used  under  Rule 32(a) in any  later-filed 

district-court  action  involving  the  same  subject  matter  if the  deposition  either  was  taken  under  these  rules  or,  al-

though  not  so  taken,  would  be  admissible  in  evidence  in the courts of the state where it was taken. 

(b)  Pending appeal. (1)  In  general.--The  court  where  a  judgment  has  been 
rendered  may,  if an  appeal  has  been  taken  or may  still be taken,  permit  a  party  to  depose  witnesses  to  perpetuate 
their testimony for use in the event of further proceedings in that court. 

(2)  Motion.--The  party  who  wants  to  perpetuate  testi-mony  may  move  for  leave  to  take  the  depositions,  on  the 
same  notice  and  service  as  if  the  action  were  pending  in the district court.  The motion must show: 

(A)  the name, address, and expected substance of the testimony of each deponent; and 
(B)  the reasons for perpetuating the testimony. 
(3)  Court  order.--If  the  court  finds  that  perpetuating 
the testimony may prevent a failure or delay of justice, the 
court  may  permit  the  depositions  to  be  taken  and  may issue  orders  like  those  authorized  by  Rules  34  and  35. 

The  depositions  may  be  taken  and  used  as  any  other deposition taken in a pending district-court action. 

(c)  Perpetuation by an action.--This rule does not limit a court's power to entertain an action to perpetuate testimony. 

Rule 28.  Persons before whom depositions may be taken. 

(a)  Within the United States. (

1)  In general.--Within the United States or a territory 
or insular possession subject to United States jurisdiction, a deposition must be taken before: 

(A)  an officer authorized to administer oaths either by federal law or by the law in the place of examination; or 
(B)  a person appointed by the court where the action 
is pending to administer oaths and take testimony. 

(2)  Definition  of "officer."--The  term  "officer" in Rules 30,  31,  and  32  includes  a  person  appointed  by  the  court 

under  this  rule  or  designated  by  the  parties  under  Rule 
29(a).

prescribed  by  that  treaty  or  convention.  A  letter  of  re-
quest may be addressed "To the Appropriate Authority in 
[name  of  country]."  A  deposition  notice  or  a  commission 
must designate by name or descriptive title the person be-
fore whom the deposition is to be taken. 

(4)  Letter  of  request--admitting  evidence.--Evidence 
obtained  in  response  to  a  letter  of  request  need  not  be 
excluded  merely  because  it  is  not  a  verbatim  transcript, 
because  the  testimony  was  not  taken  under  oath,  or  be-
cause  of  any  similar  departure  from  the  requirements  for 
depositions taken within the United States.

late that: (a)  a  deposition  may  be  taken  before  any  person,  at  any 
time or place, on any notice, and in the manner specified--in which  event  it  may  be  used  in  the  same  way  as  any  other 
deposition; and (b)  other  procedures  governing  or  limiting  discovery  be 
modified--but  a stipulation  extending the  time  for any  form of  discovery  must  have  court  approval  if  it  would  interfere 
with the time set for completing discovery, for hearing a mo-tion, or for trial. 

Rule 30.  Depositions by oral examination. 

(a)  When a deposition may be taken. (

1)  Without leave.--A party may, by oral questions, de-pose  any  person,  including  a  party,  without  leave  of  court 

except  as  provided  in  Rule  30(a)(2).  The  deponent's  at-tendance  may  be  compelled  by  subpoena  under  Rule  45. 

(2)  With leave.--A party must obtain leave of court, and the  court  must  grant  leave  to  the  extent  consistent  with 
Rule 26(b)(2): 

(A)  if  the  parties  have  not  stipulated  to  the  dep-osition and:

time; or

(b)  Notice  of  the  deposition;  other  formal  requirements. 

(1)  Notice  in  general.--A  party  who  wants  to  depose 
a  person  by  oral  questions  must  give  reasonable  written 
notice  to  every  other  party.  The  notice  must  state  the 
time  and  place  of  the  deposition  and,  if  known,  the  depo-
nent's  name  and  address.  If  the  name  is  unknown,  the 
notice  must  provide  a  general  description  sufficient  to 
identify  the  person  or  the  particular  class  or  group  to 
which the person belongs. 

(2)  Producing  documents.--If  a  subpoena  duces  tecum 
is  to  be  served  on  the  deponent,  the  materials  designated 
for  production,  as  set  out  in  the  subpoena,  must  be  listed 
in  the  notice  or  in  an  attachment.  The  notice  to  a  party 
deponent  may  be  accompanied  by  a  request  under  Rule 
34  to  produce  documents  and  tangible  things  at  the 
deposition. 

(3)  Method of recording. 

(A)  Method  stated  in  the  notice.--The  party  who  no-
tices the deposition must state in the notice the method 
for  recording  the  testimony.  Unless  the  court  orders 
otherwise, testimony may be recorded by audio, audiovi-
sual,  or  stenographic  means.  The  noticing  party  bears 
the  recording  costs.  Any  party  may  arrange  to  tran-
scribe a deposition. 

(B)  Additional method.--With prior notice to the de-
ponent  and  other  parties,  any  party  may  designate  an-
other method for recording the testimony in addition to 
that  specified  in  the  original  notice.  That  party  bears 
the  expense  of  the  additional  record  or  transcript  un-
less the court orders otherwise. 

(4)  By  remote  means.--The  parties  may  stipulate--or 
the court may on motion order--that a deposition be taken 
by  telephone or  other remote  means.  For the  purpose  of 
this  rule  and  Rules  28(a),  37(a)(2),  and  37(b)(1),  the  dep-
osition  takes  place  where  the  deponent  answers  the 
questions. 

(5)  Officer's duties.

1073 RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 
(A)  Before  the  deposition.--Unless  the  parties  stipu-
late  otherwise,  a  deposition  must  be  conducted  before 
an  officer  appointed  or  designated  under  Rule  28.  The 
officer  must  begin  the  deposition  with  an  on-the-record 
statement that includes: 

(i)  the officer's name and business address; 
(ii)  the date, time, and place of the deposition; 
(iii)  the deponent's name; 
(iv)  the  officer's  administration  of  the  oath  or  af-
firmation to the deponent; and 

(v)  the identity of all persons present. 

(B)  Conducting the deposition; avoiding distortion.-- 
If the deposition is recorded nonstenographically, the of-
ficer must repeat the items in Rule 30(b)(5)(A)(i)-(iii) at 
the  beginning  of  each  unit  of  the  recording  medium. 
The  deponent's  and  attorneys'  appearance  or  demeanor 
must not be distorted through recording techniques. 

(C)  After the deposition.--At the end of a deposition, 
the  officer  must  state  on  the  record  that  the  deposition 
is  complete  and  must  set  out  any  stipulations  made  by 
the attorneys about custody of the transcript or record-
ing  and  of  the  exhibits,  or  about  any  other  pertinent 
matters. 

(6)  Notice or subpoena directed to an organization.--In 
its notice or subpoena, a party may name as the deponent a 
public or private corporation, a partnership, an association, 
a governmental agency, or other entity and must describe 
with reasonable particularity the matters for examination. 
The named organization must then  designate  one or more 
officers, directors, or managing agents, or designate other 
persons  who  consent  to  testify  on  its  behalf;  and  it  may 
set  out  the  matters  on  which  each  person  designated  will 
testify.  A  subpoena  must advise  a nonparty organization 
of  its  duty  to  make  this  designation.  The  persons  desig-
nated must testify about information known or reasonably 
available to the organization.  This paragraph (6) does not

1074  RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 

preclude  a  deposition  by  any  other  procedure  allowed  by 
these rules. 

(c)  Examination and cross-examination; record of the ex-
amination; objections; written questions. 

(1)  Examination  and  cross-examination.--The  exami-
nation  and  cross-examination  of  a  deponent  proceed  as 
they  would  at  trial  under  the  Federal  Rules  of  Evidence, 
except  Rules  103  and  615.  After  putting  the  deponent 
under oath or affirmation, the officer must record the testi-
mony  by  the  method  designated  under  Rule  30(b)(3)(A). 
The  testimony  must  be  recorded  by  the  officer  personally 
or by a person acting in the presence and under the direc-
tion of the officer. 

(2)  Objections.--An  objection  at  the  time  of  the  exami-
nation--whether  to  evidence,  to  a  party's  conduct,  to  the 
officer's qualifications, to the manner of taking the deposi-
tion,  or  to  any  other  aspect  of  the  deposition--must  be 
noted on the record, but the examination still proceeds; the 
testimony is taken subject to any objection.  An objection 
must  be  stated  concisely  in  a  nonargumentative  and  non-
suggestive  manner.  A  person  may  instruct  a  deponent 
not to answer only when necessary to preserve a privilege, 
to enforce a limitation ordered by the court, or to present 
a motion under Rule 30(d)(3). 

(3)  Participating  through  written  questions.--Instead 
of participating in the oral examination, a party may serve 
written  questions  in  a sealed  envelope on the  party notic-
ing  the  deposition,  who  must  deliver  them  to  the  officer. 
The officer must ask the deponent those questions and rec-
ord the answers verbatim. 

(d)  Duration; sanction; motion to terminate or limit. 

(1)  Duration.--Unless  otherwise  stipulated  or  ordered 
by  the  court,  a  deposition  is  limited  to  1  day  of  7  hours. 
The court must allow additional time consistent with Rule 
26(b)(2)  if  needed  to  fairly examine the  deponent  or  if the 
deponent,  another  person,  or  any  other  circumstance  im-
pedes or delays the examination.

1075 RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 
(2)  Sanction.--The  court  may  impose  an  appropriate 
sanction--including  the  reasonable  expenses  and  attor-
ney's  fees  incurred  by  any  party--on  a  person  who  im-
pedes,  delays,  or  frustrates  the  fair  examination  of  the 
deponent. 

(3)  Motion to terminate or limit. 

(A)  Grounds.--At  any  time  during  a  deposition,  the 
deponent  or  a  party  may  move  to  terminate  or  limit  it 
on the ground that it is being conducted in bad faith or in 
a  manner  that  unreasonably  annoys,  embarrasses,  or 
oppresses  the  deponent  or  party.  The  motion  may  be 
filed  in  the  court  where  the  action  is  pending  or  the 
deposition is being taken.  If the objecting deponent or 
party so demands, the deposition must be suspended for 
the time necessary to obtain an order. 

(B)  Order.--The  court  may  order  that  the  deposition 
be terminated or may limit its scope and manner as pro-
vided  in  Rule  26(c).  If  terminated,  the  deposition  may 
be resumed only by order of the court where the action 
is pending. 

(C)  Award  of  expenses.--Rule  37(a)(5)  applies  to  the 
award of expenses. 

(e)  Review by the witness; changes. 

(1)  Review;  statement  of  changes.--On  request  by  the 
deponent  or  a  party  before  the  deposition  is  completed, 
the deponent must be allowed 30 days after being notified 
by  the  officer  that  the  transcript  or  recording  is  available 
in which: 

(A)  to review the transcript or recording; and 
(B)  if there are changes  in form or substance, to sign 
a statement listing the changes and the reasons for mak-
ing them. 

(2)  Changes  indicated  in  the  officer's  certificate.--The 
officer  must  note  in  the  certificate  prescribed  by  Rule 
30(f)(1)  whether  a  review  was  requested  and,  if  so,  must 
attach  any  changes  the  deponent  makes  during  the  30-
day period.

name]"  and  must  promptly  send  it  to  the  attorney  who

wants to keep the originals, the person may: 

(i)  offer  copies  to  be  marked,  attached  to  the 
deposition,  and  then  used  as  originals--after  giving 
all  parties  a  fair  opportunity  to  verify  the  copies  by 
comparing them with the originals; or 

(ii)  give all parties a fair opportunity to inspect and 
copy  the  originals  after  they  are  marked--in  which 
event  the  originals  may  be  used  as  if  attached  to  the

move  for  an  order  that  the  originals  be  attached  to  the

by  another  method.  When  paid  reasonable  charges,  the

(E)  on  motion  and  notice,  that  exceptional  circum-
stances make it desirable--in the interest of justice and 
with  due  regard  to  the  importance  of  live  testimony  in 
open court--to permit the deposition to be used. 

(5)  Limitations on use. 

(A)  Deposition  taken  on  short  notice.--A  deposition 
must  not  be  used  against  a  party  who,  having  received 
less  than  11  days'  notice  of  the  deposition,  promptly 
moved  for  a  protective  order  under  Rule  26(c)(1)(B)  re-
questing  that  it  not  be  taken  or  be  taken  at  a  different 
time  or  place--and  this  motion  was  still  pending  when 
the deposition was taken.

1080  RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 

(B)  Unavailable deponent; party could not obtain an 
attorney.--A  deposition  taken  without  leave  of  court 
under the unavailability provision of Rule 30(a)(2)(A)(iii) 
must not be used against a party who shows that, when 
served  with  the  notice,  it  could  not,  despite  diligent 
efforts,  obtain  an  attorney  to  represent  it  at  the 
deposition. 

(6)  Using part of a deposition.--If a party offers in evi-
dence  only  part  of  a  deposition,  an  adverse  party  may  re-
quire  the  offeror  to  introduce  other  parts  that  in  fairness 
should  be  considered  with  the  part  introduced,  and  any 
party may itself introduce any other parts. 

(7)  Substituting  a  party.--Substituting  a  party  under 
Rule  25  does  not  affect  the  right  to  use  a  deposition  pre-
viously taken. 

(8)  Deposition  taken  in  an  earlier  action.--A  deposi-
tion lawfully taken and, if required, filed in any federal- or 
state-court  action  may  be  used  in  a  later  action  involving 
the  same  subject  matter  between  the  same  parties,  or 
their representatives or successors in interest, to the same 
extent  as  if  taken  in  the  later  action.  A  deposition  pre-
viously taken  may also be used  as allowed by the Federal 
Rules of Evidence. 

(b)  Objections  to  admissibility.--Subject  to  Rules  28(b) 
and  32(d)(3),  an objection  may  be  made  at a  hearing  or  trial 
to  the  admission  of  any  deposition  testimony  that  would  be 
inadmissible if the witness were present and testifying. 

(c)  Form of presentation.--Unless the court orders other-
wise,  a  party  must  provide  a  transcript  of  any  deposition 
testimony  the  party  offers,  but  may  provide  the  court  with 
the testimony in nontranscript form as well.  On any party's 
request,  deposition  testimony  offered  in  a  jury  trial  for  any 
purpose  other than  impeachment  must  be presented  in  non-
transcript  form,  if  available,  unless  the  court  for  good  cause 
orders otherwise. 

(d)  Waiver of objections.

(1)  To the notice.--An objection to an error or irregular-
ity in a deposition notice is waived unless promptly served 
in writing on the party giving the notice. 

(2)  To  the  officer's  qualification.--An  objection  based 
on  disqualification of  the  officer  before  whom  a  deposition 
is to be taken is waived if not made: 

(A)  before the deposition begins; or 
(B)  promptly  after  the  basis  for  disqualification  be-
comes  known  or,  with  reasonable  diligence,  could  have 
been known. 

(3)  To the taking of the deposition. 

(A)  Objection  to  competence,  relevance,  or  material-
ity.--An  objection  to  a  deponent's  competence--or  to 
the competence, relevance, or materiality of testimony-- 
is  not  waived  by  a  failure  to  make  the  objection  before 
or  during  the  deposition, unless  the  ground  for it  might 
have been corrected at that time. 

(B)  Objection to an  error or irregularity.--An objec-
tion  to  an  error  or  irregularity  at  an  oral  examination 
is waived if: 

(i)  it relates to the manner of taking the deposition, 
the form of a question or answer, the oath or affirma-
tion,  a  party's  conduct,  or  other  matters  that  might 
have been corrected at that time; and 

(ii)  it is not timely made during the deposition. 

(C)  Objection to a written question.--An objection to 
the  form  of  a  written  question  under  Rule  31  is  waived 
if  not  served  in  writing  on  the  party  submitting  the 
question  within  the  time  for  serving  responsive  ques-
tions  or,  if  the  question  is  a  recross-question,  within  5 
days after being served with it. 

(4)  To  completing  and  returning  the  deposition.--An 
objection  to  how  the  officer  transcribed  the  testimony-- 
or  prepared,  signed,  certified,  sealed,  endorsed,  sent,  or 
otherwise  dealt  with  the  deposition--is  waived  unless  a 
motion  to  suppress  is  made  promptly  after  the  error  or

irregularity becomes known  or, with  reasonable diligence, 
could have been known. 

Rule 33.  Interrogatories to parties. 

(a)  In general. 

(1)  Number.--Unless  otherwise  stipulated  or  ordered 
by  the  court,  a  party  may  serve  on  any  other  party  no 
more than 25 written interrogatories, including all discrete 
subparts.  Leave  to  serve  additional  interrogatories  may 
be granted to the extent consistent with Rule 26(b)(2). 

(2)  Scope.--An  interrogatory  may  relate  to  any  matter 
that may be inquired into under Rule 26(b).  An interrog-
atory  is  not  objectionable  merely  because  it  asks  for  an 
opinion or contention that relates to fact or the application 
of law to fact, but the court may order that the interroga-
tory  need  not  be  answered  until  designated  discovery  is 
complete, or until a pretrial conference or some other time. 

(b)  Answers and objections. 

(1)  Responding  party.--The  interrogatories  must  be 
answered: 

(A)  by the party to whom they are directed; or 
(B)  if  that  party  is  a  public  or  private  corporation,  a 
partnership,  an  association,  or  a  governmental  agency, 
by  any  officer  or  agent,  who  must  furnish  the  informa-
tion available to the party. 

(2)  Time to respond.--The responding party must serve 
its answers and  any objections within  30 days after  being 
served with the interrogatories.  A shorter or longer time 
may  be  stipulated  to  under  Rule  29  or  be  ordered  by  the 
court. 

(3)  Answering each interrogatory.--Each interrogatory 
must, to the extent it is not objected to, be answered sepa-
rately and fully in writing under oath. 

(4)  Objections.--The  grounds  for  objecting  to  an  inter-
rogatory must be stated with specificity.  Any ground not 
stated in a timely objection is waived unless the court, for 
good cause, excuses the failure.

1083 RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 
(5)  Signature.--The  person  who  makes  the  answers 
must  sign  them,  and  the  attorney  who  objects  must  sign 
any objections. 

(c)  Use.--An  answer  to  an  interrogatory  may  be  used  to 
the extent allowed by the Federal Rules of Evidence. 

(d)  Option to produce business records.--If the answer to 
an interrogatory may be determined by examining, auditing, 
compiling,  abstracting,  or  summarizing  a  party's  business 
records  (including  electronically  stored  information),  and  if 
the  burden  of  deriving  or  ascertaining  the  answer  will  be 
substantially the same for either party, the responding party 
may answer by: 

(1)  specifying the records that must be reviewed, in suf-
ficient  detail  to  enable  the  interrogating  party  to  locate 
and  identify  them  as  readily  as  the  responding  party 
could; and 

(2)  giving the interrogating party a reasonable opportu-
nity to examine and audit the records and to make copies, 
compilations, abstracts, or summaries. 

Rule  34.  Producing  documents,  electronically  stored  infor-

mation,  and tangible  things, or  entering  onto  land,  for 
inspection and other purposes. 

(a)  In  general.--A  party  may  serve  on  any  other  party  a 
request within the scope of Rule 26(b): 

(1)  to  produce  and  permit  the  requesting  party  or  its 
representative to inspect, copy, test, or sample the follow-
ing  items  in  the  responding  party's  possession,  custody, 
or control: 

(A)  any designated documents or electronically stored 
information--including writings,  drawings, graphs, 
charts,  photographs,  sound  recordings,  images,  and 
other  data  or  data  compilations--stored  in  any  medium 
from  which  information  can  be  obtained  either  directly 
or,  if  necessary,  after  translation  by  the  responding 
party into a reasonably usable form; or 

(B)  any designated tangible things; or

1084  RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 

(2)  to  permit  entry  onto  designated  land  or other  prop-
erty  possessed  or  controlled  by  the  responding  party,  so 
that  the  requesting  party  may  inspect,  measure,  survey, 
photograph, test, or sample the property or any designated 
object or operation on it. 

(b)  Procedure. 

(1)  Contents of the request.--The request: 

(A)  must  describe  with  reasonable  particularity  each 
item or category of items to be inspected; 

(B)  must specify a reasonable time, place, and manner 
for  the  inspection  and  for  performing  the  related  acts; 
and 

(C)  may specify the form or forms in which electroni-
cally stored information is to be produced. 

(2)  Responses and objections. 

(A)  Time  to  respond.--The  party  to  whom  the  re-
quest is directed must respond in writing within 30 days 
after  being  served.  A  shorter  or  longer  time  may  be 
stipulated to  under Rule  29  or be  ordered  by  the  court. 

(B)  Responding to each item.--For each item or cate-
gory, the response must either state that inspection and 
related activities will be permitted as requested or state 
an objection to the request, including the reasons. 

(C)  Objections.--An  objection  to  part  of  a  request 
must specify the part and permit inspection of the rest. 

(D)  Responding  to  a  request  for  production  of  elec-
tronically stored in formation.--The response may 
state  an  objection  to  a  requested  form  for  producing 
electronically  stored  information.  If  the  responding 
party  objects  to  a  requested  form--or  if  no  form  was 
specified in  the request--the party must state the  form 
or forms it intends to use. 

(E)  Producing the documents or electronically stored 
information.--Unless  otherwise  stipulated  or  ordered 
by the court, these procedures apply to producing docu-
ments or electronically stored information: 

Date/Time: 05-12-10 16:26:21
Job: 550RUL Unit: U$CV Pagination Table: RULES1

1085 RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 
(i)  A  party  must  produce  documents  as  they  are 
kept  in  the  usual course  of business  or  must organize 
and  label  them  to  correspond  to  the  categories  in  the 
request; 

(ii)  If a request does not specify a form for produc-
ing  electronically  stored  information,  a  party  must 
produce it in a form or forms in which it is ordinarily 
maintained  or  in  a  reasonably  usable  form  or  forms; 
and 

(iii)  A  party  need  not  produce  the  same  electroni-
cally stored information in more than one form. 

(c)  Nonparties.--As  provided in  Rule  45,  a nonparty  may 
be compelled to produce documents and tangible things or to 
permit an inspection. 

Rule 35.  Physical and mental examinations. 

(a)  Order for an examination. 

(1)  In  general.--The  court  where  the  action  is  pending 
may  order  a  party  whose  mental  or  physical  condition-- 
including  blood  group--is  in  controversy  to  submit  to  a 
physical  or  mental  examination  by  a  suitably  licensed  or 
certified  examiner.  The  court  has  the  same  authority  to 
order  a  party  to  produce  for  examination  a  person  who  is 
in its custody or under its legal control. 

(2)  Motion  and  notice;  contents  of  the  order.--The 
order: 

(A)  may  be  made  only  on  motion  for  good  cause  and 
on  notice  to  all  parties  and  the  person  to  be  examined; 
and 

(B)  must  specify  the  time,  place,  manner,  conditions, 
and  scope  of  the  examination,  as  well  as  the  person  or 
persons who will perform it. 

(b)  Examiner's report. 

(1)  Request  by  the  party  or  person  examined.--The 
party  who  moved  for  the  examination  must,  on  request, 
deliver  to  the  requester  a  copy  of  the  examiner's  report, 
together with like reports of all earlier examinations of the

1086  RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 

same  condition.  The  request  may  be  made  by  the  party against whom the examination order was issued or by the 

person examined. (

2)  Contents.--The  examiner's  report  must  be  in  writ-
ing  and  must  set  out  in  detail  the  examiner's  findings,  in-cluding diagnoses, conclusions, and the results of any tests. 

(3)  Request by the  moving party.--After  delivering the reports,  the  party  who  moved  for  the  examination  may 
request--and  is  entitled  to  receive--from  the  party against  whom  the  examination  order  was  issued  like  re-
ports of all earlier or later examinations of the same condi-
tion.  But  those  reports  need  not  be  delivered  by  the party  with  custody  or  control  of  the  person  examined  if 

the party shows that it could not obtain them. (

4)  Waiver  of  privilege.--By  requesting  and  obtaining 
the  examiner's  report,  or  by  deposing  the  examiner,  the party examined waives any privilege it may have--in that 

action  or  any  other  action  involving  the  same  contro-versy--concerning testimony about all examinations of the 
same condition. (

5)  Failure  to  deliver  a  report.--The  court  on  motion 
may order--on just terms--that a party deliver the report of an examination.  If the report is not provided, the court 

may exclude the examiner's testimony at trial. 

(6)  Scope.--This subdivision (b) applies also to an exam-
ination made  by the  parties'  agreement, unless  the  agree-
ment  states  otherwise.  This  subdivision  does  not  pre-
clude  obtaining  an  examiner's  report  or  deposing  an 
examiner under other rules. 

Rule 36.  Requests for admission. 

(a)  Scope and procedure. 

(1)  Scope.--A  party  may  serve  on  any  other  party  a 
written  request  to  admit,  for  purposes  of  the  pending  ac-
tion only, the truth of any matters within the scope of Rule 
26(b)(1) relating to: 

(A)  facts,  the  application  of  law  to  fact,  or  opinions 
about either; and 

Date/Time: 05-12-10 16:26:21

1087 RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 
(B)  the genuineness of any described documents. 
(2)  Form;  copy  of  a  document.--Each  matter  must  be separately stated.  A request to admit the genuineness of 

a  document  must  be  accompanied  by  a  copy  of  the  docu-ment unless it is, or has been, otherwise furnished or made 
available for inspection and copying. (

3)  Time  to  respond;  effect  of  not  responding.--A  mat-ter  is  admitted  unless,  within  30  days  after  being  served, 

the  party  to  whom  the  request  is  directed  serves  on  the requesting party a written answer or objection addressed 
to the  matter and signed  by  the  party or  its  attorney.  A shorter or longer time for responding may be stipulated to 
under Rule 29 or be ordered by the court. (4)  Answer.--If  a  matter  is  not  admitted,  the  answer 
must specifically deny it or state in detail why the answer-ing  party  cannot  truthfully  admit  or  deny  it.  A  denial 
must  fairly  respond  to  the  substance  of  the  matter;  and when  good  faith  requires  that  a  party  qualify  an  answer 
or  deny  only  a  part  of  a  matter,  the  answer  must  specify the  part  admitted  and  qualify  or  deny  the  rest.  The  an-
swering  party  may  assert  lack  of  knowledge  or  informa-tion  as  a  reason  for  failing  to  admit  or  deny  only  if  the 
party  states  that  it  has  made  reasonable  inquiry  and  that the  information  it  knows  or  can  readily  obtain  is  insuffi-
cient to enable it to admit or deny. (

5)  Objections.--The grounds  for  objecting  to  a request must  be  stated.  A  party  must  not  object  solely  on  the 

ground that the request presents a genuine issue for trial. (

6)  Motion  regarding  the  sufficiency  of  an  answer  or objection.--The  requesting  party  may  move  to  determine 

the  sufficiency  of  an  answer  or  objection.  Unless  the court finds an objection justified, it must order that an an-
swer be served.  On finding that an answer does not com-ply  with  this  rule,  the  court  may  order  either  that  the 
matter is  admitted  or that an  amended  answer  be served. The  court  may  defer  its  final  decision  until  a  pretrial 
conference  or  a  specified  time  before  trial.  Rule  37(a)(5) applies to an award of expenses.

1088  RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 

(b)  Effect  of  an  admission;  withdrawing  or  amending 
it.--A matter admitted under this rule is conclusively estab-
lished  unless  the  court,  on  motion,  permits  the  admission  to 
be withdrawn or amended.  Subject to Rule 16(e), the court 
may  permit  withdrawal  or  amendment  if  it  would  promote 
the  presentation  of  the  merits  of  the  action  and  if  the  court 
is not persuaded that it would prejudice the requesting party 
in  maintaining  or  defending  the  action  on  the  merits.  An 
admission  under  this  rule  is  not  an  admission  for  any  other 
purpose  and  cannot  be  used  against  the  party  in  any  other 
proceeding. 

Rule 37.  Failure to make disclosures or to cooperate in dis-

covery; sanctions. 

(a)  M ot ion  for  an  order  compell ing  discl osure  or 
discovery. 

(1)  In  general.--On  notice  to  other  parties  and  all  af-
fected persons, a party may move for an order compelling 
disclosure or discovery.  The motion must include a certi-
fication  that the movant  has  in  good faith conferred  or at-
tempted to confer with the person or party failing to make 
disclosure  or  discovery  in  an  effort  to  obtain  it  without 
court action. 

(2)  Appropriate  court.--A  motion  for  an  order  to  a 
party must be made in the court where the action is pend-
ing.  A  motion  for  an  order  to  a  nonparty  must  be  made 
in the court where the discovery is or will be taken. 

(3)  Specific motions. 

(A)  To  compel  disclosure.--If  a  party  fails  to  make  a 
disclosure  required  by  Rule  26(a),  any  other  party  may 
move to compel disclosure and for appropriate sanctions. 

(B)  To  compel  a  discovery  response.--A  party  seek-
ing  discovery  may  move  for  an  order  compelling  an  an-
swer,  designation,  production,  or  inspection.  This  mo-
tion may be made if: 

(i)  a  deponent  fails  to  answer  a  question  asked 
under Rule 30 or 31; 

Date/Time: 05-12-10 16:26:21
Job: 550RUL Unit: U$CV Pagination Table: RULES1

1089 RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 
(ii)  a corporation or other entity fails to make a des-ignation under Rule 30(b)(6) or 31(a)(4); 

(iii)  a  party  fails  to  answer  an  interrogatory  sub-mitted under Rule 33; or 
(iv)  a  party  fails  to  respond  that  inspection  will be  permitted--or  fails  to  permit  inspection--as  re-
quested under Rule 34. 
(C)  Related  to  a  deposition.--When  taking  an  oral 
deposition, the party asking a question may complete or adjourn the examination before moving for an order. 

(4)  Evasive  or  incomplete  disclosure,  answer,  or  re-
sponse.  For  purposes  of  this  subdivision  (a),  an  evasive 
or  incomplete  disclosure,  answer,  or  response  must  be treated as a failure to disclose, answer, or respond. 

(5)  Payment of expenses; protective orders. (

A)  If the motion is granted (or disclosure or discov-
ery is provided after filing).--If the motion is granted-- or  if  the  disclosure  or  requested  discovery  is  provided 

after the motion was filed--the court must, after giving 
an  opportunity  to  be  heard,  require  the  party  or  depo-nent  whose  conduct  necessitated  the  motion,  the  party 

or  attorney  advising  that  conduct,  or  both  to  pay  the movant's  reasonable  expenses  incurred  in  making  the 
motion,  including  attorney's  fees.  But  the  court  must 
not order this payment if: 

(i)  the movant filed the motion before attempting in 
good  faith  to  obtain  the  disclosure  or  discovery  with-
out court action; 

(ii)  the opposing party's nondisclosure, response, or 
objection was substantially justified; or 

(iii)  other  circumstances  make  an  award  of  ex-
penses unjust. 

(B)  If the motion is denied.--If  the  motion  is  denied, 
the  court  may  issue  any  protective  order  authorized 
under  Rule  26(c)  and  must,  after  giving  an  opportunity 
to  be  heard,  require  the  movant,  the  attorney  filing the 
motion,  or  both  to  pay  the  party  or  deponent  who  op-

1090  RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 

posed  the  motion  its  reasonable  expenses  incurred  in 
opposing the motion, including attorney's fees.  But the 
court  must  not  order  this  payment  if  the  motion  was 
substantially  justified  or  other  circumstances  make  an 
award of expenses unjust. 

(C)  If  the  motion  is  granted  in  part  and  denied  in 
part.--If the motion is granted in part and denied in part, 
the  court  may  issue  any  protective  order  authorized 
under  Rule  26(c)  and  may,  after  giving  an  opportunity 
to  be  heard,  apportion  the  reasonable  expenses  for  the 
motion. 

(b)  Failure to comply with a court order. 

(1)  Sanctions  in  the  district  where  the  deposition  is 
taken.--If the court where the discovery is taken orders a 
deponent to be sworn or to answer a question and the de-
ponent  fails  to  obey,  the  failure  may  be  treated  as  con-
tempt of court. 

(2)  Sanctions  in  the  distr ict  where  the  act ion  is 
pending. 

(A)  For not obeying a discovery order.--If a party or 
a  party's  officer, director, or  managing agent--or a  wit-
ness designated under Rule 30(b)(6) or 31(a)(4)--fails to 
obey  an  order  to  provide  or  permit  discovery,  including 
an  order  under  Rule  26(f ),  35,  or  37(a),  the  court  where 
the  action  is  pending  may  issue  further  just  orders. 
They may include the following: 

(i)  directing that the matters embraced in the order 
or  other  designated  facts  be  taken  as  established  for 
purposes of the action, as the prevailing party claims; 

(ii)  prohibiting the disobedient party from support-
ing or opposing designated claims or defenses, or from 
introducing designated matters in evidence; 

(iii)  striking pleadings in whole or in part; 
(iv)  staying  further  proceedings  until  the  order  is 
obeyed; 

(v)  dismissing  the  action  or  proceeding  in  whole  or 
in part;

1091 RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 
(vi)  rendering  a  default  judgment  against  the  dis-obedient party; or 

(vii)  treating  as  contempt  of  court  the  failure  to obey any order except an order to submit to a physical 
or mental examination. 
(B)  For not producing a person for examination.--If 
a  party  fails  to  comply  with  an  order  under  Rule  35(a) requiring  it  to  produce  another  person  for  examination, 

the  court  may  issue  any  of  the  orders  listed  in  Rule 37(b)(2)(A)(i)-(vi),  unless  the  disobedient  party  shows 
that it cannot produce the other person. (

C)  Payment  of  expenses.--Instead  of  or  in  addition 
to  the  orders  above,  the  court  must  order  the  disobedi-ent  party,  the  attorney  advising  that  party,  or  both  to 

pay  the  reasonable  expenses,  including  attorney's  fees, 
caused  by  the  failure,  unless  the  failure  was  substan-tially justified or other circumstances make an award of 

expenses unjust. 
(c)  Failure to disclose, to supplement an earlier response, 
or to admit. (

1)  Failure  to  disclose  or  supplement.--If  a  party  fails 
to  provide  information  or  identify  a  witness  as  required by  Rule  26(a)  or  (e),  the  party  is  not  allowed  to  use  that 

information  or  witness  to  supply evidence  on  a  motion,  at 
a hearing, or at a trial, unless the failure was substantially 
justified  or  is  harmless.  In  addition  to  or  instead  of  this 
sanction, the court, on motion and after giving an opportu-
nity to be heard: 

(A)  may  order  payment  of  the  reasonable  expenses, 
including attorney's fees, caused by the failure; 

(B)  may inform the jury of the party's failure; and 
(C)  may  impose  other  appropriate  sanctions,  includ-
ing  any  of  the  orders  listed  in  Rule  37(b)(2)(A)(i)-(vi). 

(2)  Failure  to  admit.--If  a  party  fails  to  admit  what  is 
requested under Rule 36 and if the requesting party later 
proves  a  document  to  be  genuine  or  the  matter  true,  the 
requesting  party  may  move  that  the  party  who  failed  to

admit  pay  the  reasonable  expenses,  including  attorney's fees,  incurred  in  making  that  proof.  The  court  must  so 

order unless: (A)  the  request  was  held  objectionable  under  Rule 

36(a); (B)  the  admissi on  sought  was  of  no  substantial 

importance; (C)  the party failing to admit had a reasonable ground 
to believe that it might prevail on the matter; or (D)  there  was  other  good  reason  for  the  failure  to 
admit. 
(d)  Party's  failure  to  attend  its  own  deposition,  serve 
answers  to  interrogatories,  or  respond  to  a  request  for 
inspection. 

(1)  In general. 

(A)  Motion; grounds for sanctions.--The court where the action is pending may, on motion, order sanctions if: 

(i)  a party or a party's officer, director, or managing agent--or a  person designated under Rule  30(b)(6) or 
31(a)(4)--fails,  after  being  served  with  proper  notice, to appear for that person's deposition; or 

(ii)  a party, after being properly served with inter-rogatories  under  Rule  33  or  a  request  for  inspection 
under  Rule  34,  fails  to  serve  its  answers,  objections, 
or written response. 

(B)  Certification.--A  motion  for  sanctions  for  failing 
to  answer  or  respond  must  include  a  certification  that 
the  movant  has  in  good  faith  conferred  or  attempted  to 
confer with the party failing to act in an effort to obtain 

the answer or response without court action. 

(2)  Unacceptable  excuse  for  failing  to  act.--A  failure 
described in Rule 37(d)(1)(A) is not excused on the ground 
that  the  discovery  sought  was  objectionable,  unless  the 
party  failing  to  act  has  a pending  motion  for  a  protective 
order under Rule 26(c). 

(3)  Types  of  sanctions.--Sanctions  may  include  any  of 
the orders listed in Rule 37(b)(2)(A)(i)-(vi).  Instead of or

in  addition  to  these  sanctions,  the  court  must  require  the party  failing  to  act,  the  attorney  advising  that  party,  or 

both  to  pay  the  reasonable  expenses,  including  attorney's fees, caused by the failure, unless the failure was substan-
tially  justified  or  other  circumstances  make  an  award  of expenses unjust. 

(e)  Failure to prov ide electronically stored in forma-
tion.--Absent  exceptional  circumstances,  a  court  may  not 
impose  sanctions  under  these  rules  on  a  party  for  failing  to provide  electronically  stored  information  lost  as  a  result  of 

the  routine,  good-faith  operation  of  an  electronic  informa-tion system. 

( f )  Failure to participate in framing a discovery plan.-- If  a  party  or  its  attorney  fails  to  participate  in  good  faith 
in  developing  and  submitting  a  proposed  discovery  plan  as 
required by Rule 26(f ), the court may, after giving an oppor-tunity  to  be  heard,  require  that  party  or  attorney  to  pay  to 

any  other  party  the  reasonable  expenses,  including  attor-ney's fees, caused by the failure.

only some issues, any other party may--within 10 days after 
being  served  with  the  demand  or  within  a  shorter  time  or-
dered  by  the  court--serve  a  demand  for  a  jury  trial  on  any 
other or all factual issues triable by jury. 

(d)  Waiver; withdrawal.--A party waives  a jury  trial un-
less  its  demand  is  properly  served  and  filed.  A  proper  de-
mand may be withdrawn only if the parties consent. 

(e)  Admiralty and maritime claims.--These rules do not 
create  a  right  to  a  jury  trial  on  issues  in  a  claim  that  is  an 
admiralty or maritime claim under Rule 9(h). 

Rule 39.  Trial by jury or by the court. 

(a)  When a demand is made.--When a jury trial has been 
demanded  under  Rule  38,  the  action  must  be  designated  on 
the  docket  as  a  jury  action.  The  trial  on  all  issues  so  de-
manded must be by jury unless: 

(1)  the  parties  or  their  attorneys  file  a  stipulation  to  a 
nonjury trial or so stipulate on the record; or 

(2)  the court, on motion or on its own, finds that on some 
or all of those issues there is no federal right to a jury trial. 

(b)  When  no  demand  is  made.--Issues  on  which  a  jury 
trial  is  not  properly  demanded  are  to  be  tried  by  the  court. 
But the court may, on motion, order a jury trial on any issue 
for which a jury might have been demanded. 

(c)  Advisory jury; jury trial by consent.--In an action not 
triable of right by a jury, the court, on motion or on its own: 

(1)  may try any issue with an advisory jury; or 
(2)  may,  with  the  parties'  consent,  try  any  issue  by  a 
jury  whose  verdict  has  the  same  effect  as  if  a  jury  trial 
had been a matter of right, unless the action is against the 
United  States  and  a  federal  statute  provides  for  a  non-
jury trial. 

Rule 40.  Scheduling cases for trial. 

Each  court  must  provide  by  rule  for  scheduling  trials. 
The  court  must  give  priority  to  actions  entitled  to  priority 
by a federal statute.

1095 RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 
Rule 41.  Dismissal of actions. 

(a)  Voluntary dismissal. (

1)  By the Plaintiff. (A)  Without  a  court  order.--Subject  to  Rules  23(e), 

23.1(c),  23.2,  and  66  and  any  applicable  federal  statute, the plaintiff may dismiss an action without a court order 
by filing: (i)  a  notice  of  dismissal  before  the  opposing  party 

serves  either  an  answer  or  a  motion  for  summary judgment; or 

(ii)  a  stipulation  of  dismissal  signed  by  all  parties who have appeared. 

(B)  Effect.--Unless  the  notice  or  stipulation  states otherwise,  the  dismissal  is  without  prejudice.  But  if 
the  plaintiff  previously  dismissed  any  federal- or state-court action based on or including the same claim, 
a  notice  of  dismissal  operates  as  an  adjudication  on  the merits. 

(2)  By  court  order;  effect.--Except  as  provided  in  Rule 41(a)(1),  an  action  may  be  dismissed  at  the  plaintiff 's  re-
quest only by court order, on terms that the court consid-ers proper.  If a defendant has pleaded a counterclaim be-
fore  being  served  with  the  plaintiff 's  motion  to  dismiss, the action may be dismissed over the defendant's objection 
only if the counterclaim can remain pending for independ-ent  adjudication.  Unless  the  order  states  otherwise,  a 
dismissal under this paragraph (2) is without prejudice. 
(b)  Involuntary  dismissal;  effect.--If  the  plaintiff  fails  to prosecute  or  to  comply  with  these  rules  or  a  court  order, 

a  defendant  may  move  to  dismiss  the  action  or  any  claim against  it.  Unless  the  dismissal  order  states  otherwise,  a 
dismissal  under  this  subdivision  (b)  and  any  dismissal  not under this rule--except one for lack of jurisdiction, improper 
venue, or failure  to join  a party under Rule 19--operates as an adjudication on the merits. 

(c)  Dismissing a counterclaim, crossclaim, or third-party 
claim.--This rule applies to a dismissal of any counterclaim, 

Date/Time: 05-12-10 16:26:21

1096  RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 
crossclaim, or third-party claim.  A claimant's voluntary dis-
missal under Rule 41(a)(1)(A)(i) must be made: 

(1)  before a responsive pleading is served; or 
(2)  if there is no responsive pleading, before evidence is 
introduced at a hearing or trial. 

(d)  Costs  of  a  previously  dismissed action.--If  a  plaintiff 
who  previously  dismissed  an  action  in  any  court  files  an  ac-
tion  based  on  or  including  the  same  claim  against  the  same 
defendant, the court: 

(1)  may order the plaintiff to pay all or part of the costs 
of that previous action; and 

(2)  may  stay  the  proceedings  until  the  plaintiff  has 
complied. 

Rule 42.  Consolidation; separate trials. 

(a)  Consolidation.--If  actions  before  the  court  involve  a 
common question of law or fact, the court may: 

(1)  join  for  hearing  or  trial  any  or  all  matters  at  issue 
in the actions; 

(2)  consolidate the actions; or 
(3)  issue  any  other  orders  to  avoid  unnecessary  cost 
or delay. 

(b)  Separate  trials.--For  convenience,  to  avoid  prejudice, 
or to expedite and economize, the court may order a separate 
trial  of  one  or  more  separate  issues,  claims,  crossclaims, 
counterclaims, or third-party claims.  When ordering a sep-
arate  trial,  the  court  must  preserve  any  federal  right  to  a 
jury trial. 

Rule 43.  Taking testimony. 

(a)  In  open  court.--At  trial,  the  witnesses'  testimony 
must  be  taken  in  open  court  unless  a  federal  statute,  the 
Federal  Rules  of  Evidence,  these  rules,  or  other  rules 
adopted  by  the  Supreme  Court  provide  otherwise.  For 
good cause in compelling circumstances and with appropriate 
safeguards, the court may permit testimony in open court by 
contemporaneous transmission from a different location.

1097 RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 
(b)  Affirmation instead of an oath.--When these rules re-quire an oath, a solemn affirmation suffices. 

(c)  Evidence on a motion.--When a motion relies on facts outside the  record, the  court may  hear the matter on  affida-
vits  or  may  hear  it  wholly  or  partly  on  oral  testimony  or on depositions. 

(d)  Interpreter.--The court may appoint an interpreter of its  choosing;  fix  reasonable  compensation  to  be  paid  from 
funds provided by law or by one or more parties; and tax the compensation as costs. 

Rule 44.  Proving an official record. 

(a)  Means of proving. (

1)  Domestic  record.--Each  of  the  following  evidences an official record--or an entry in it--that is otherwise ad-

missible  and  is  kept  within  the  United  States,  any  state, district,  or commonwealth, or any territory  subject  to  the 
administrative or judicial jurisdiction of the United States: (A)  an official publication of the record; or 

(B)  a  copy  attested  by  the  officer  with  legal  custody of the record--or by the officer's deputy--and accompa-
nied  by  a  certificate  that  the  officer  has  custody.  The certificate must be made under seal: 

(i)  by  a judge  of a court of record in the  district or political subdivision where the record is kept; or 
(ii)  by  any  public  officer  with  a  seal  of  office  and with  official  duties  in  the  district  or  political  subdivi-
sion where the record is kept. 
(2)  Foreign record. (

A)  In  general.--Each  of  the  following  evidences  a 
foreign  official  record--or  an  entry  in  it--that  is  other-wise admissible: 

(i)  an official publication of the record; or (ii)  the  record--or  a  copy--that  is  attested  by  an 
authorized person and is accompanied either by a final certification of genuineness or by a certification under 
a treaty or convention to which the United States and 
the  country  where  the  record  is  located  are  parties.

1098  RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 

(B)  Final certification of genuineness.--A final certi-fication  must  certify  the  genuineness  of  the  signature 

and  official  position  of  the  attester  or  of  any  foreign  of-ficial  whose  certificate  of  genuineness  relates  to  the  at-
testation  or  is  in  a  chain  of  certificates  of  genuineness relating to the attestation.  A final certification may be 
made by a secretary of a United States embassy or lega-tion;  by  a  consul  general,  vice  consul,  or  consular  agent 
of the United States; or by a diplomatic or consular offi-cial of the foreign country assigned or accredited to the 
United States. (

C)  Other  means  of  proof.--If  all  parties  have  had a  reasonable  opportunity  to  investigate  a  foreign  rec-

ord's  authenticity  and  accuracy,  the  court  may,  for  good cause, either: 

(i)  admit  an  attested  copy  without  final  certifica-tion; or 
(ii)  permit  the  record  to  be  evidenced  by  an  at-tested  summary  with  or  without  a  final  certification. 

(b)  Lack of a record.--A written statement that a diligent search  of  designated  records  revealed  no  record  or  entry  of 
a  specified  tenor  is  admissible  as  evidence  that  the  records contain  no  such  record  or  entry.  For  domestic  records,  the 
statement  must  be  authenticated  under  Rule  44(a)(1).  For foreign records, the statement must comply with (a)(2)(C)(ii). 

(c)  Other  proof.--A  party  may  prove  an  official  record-- 
or  an  entry  or  lack  of  an  entry  in  it--by  any  other  method authorized by law. 

Rule 44.1.  Determining foreign law. 

A party who intends to raise an issue about a foreign coun-try's law must give notice by a pleading or other writing.  In 

determining foreign law, the court may consider any relevant material or source, including testimony, whether or not sub-
mitted  by  a  party  or  admissible  under  the  Federal  Rules  of Evidence.  The  court's  determination  must  be  treated  as  a 
ruling on a question of law.

court  for  the  district  where  the  hearing  or  trial  is  to 
be held; 

(B)  for  attendance  at  a  deposition,  from  the  court  for 
the district where the deposition is to be taken; and 

(C)  for  production  or  inspection,  if  separate  from  a

court for the district where the production or inspection 
is to be made. 

(3)  Issued by whom.--The clerk must issue a subpoena,

practice; or 

(B)  a  court  for  a  district  where  a  deposition  is  to  be

its  officers  or  agencies.  If  the  subpoena  commands  the 
production  of  documents,  electronically  stored  informa-

trial, production, or inspection; or 

(D)  that  the  court  authorizes  on  motion  and  for  good

subpoena  must  take  reasonable  steps  to  avoid  imposing 
undue  burden  or  expense  on  a  person  subject  to  the  sub-
poena.  The  issuing  court  must  enforce  this  duty  and  im-

1102  RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 

(B)  Objections.--A  person  commanded to produce 
documents  or  tangible  things  or  to  permit  inspection 
may  serve  on  the  party  or  attorney  designated  in  the 
subpoena  a  written  objection  to  inspecting,  copying, 
testing  or  sampling  any  or  all  of  the  materials  or  to  in-
specting  the  premises--or  to  producing  electronically 
stored information in the form or forms requested.  The 
objection  must  be  served  before  the  earlier  of  the  time 
specified for compliance or 14 days after the subpoena is 
served.  If  an  objection  is  made,  the  following  rules 
apply: 

(i)  At any time, on notice to the commanded person, 
the  serving  party  may  move  the  issuing  court  for  an 
order compelling production or inspection. 

(ii)  These  acts  may  be  required  only  as  directed  in 
the order, and the order must protect a person who is 
neither  a  party  nor  a  party's  officer  from  significant 
expense resulting from compliance. 

(3)  Quashing or modifying a subpoena. 

(A)  When  required.--On  timely  motion,  the  issuing 
court must quash or modify a subpoena that: 

(i)  fails to allow a reasonable time to comply; 
(ii)  requires  a  person  who  is  neither  a  party  nor  a 
party's  officer  to  travel  more  than  100  miles  from 
where  that  person  resides,  is  employed,  or  regularly 
transacts  business  in  person--except  that,  subject  to 
Rule  45(c)(3)(B)(iii),  the  person  may  be  commanded 
to  attend  a  trial  by  traveling  from  any  such  place 
within the state where the trial is held; 

(iii)  requires  disclosure  of  privileged  or  other  pro-
tected matter, if no exception or waiver applies; or 

(iv)  subjects a person to undue burden. 

(B)  When  permitted.--To protect  a  person  subject to 
or affected by a subpoena, the issuing court may, on mo-
tion, quash or modify the subpoena if it requires:

(ii)  disclosing  an  unretained  expert's  opinion  or  in-
formation  that  does  not  describe  specific  occurrences

was not requested by a party; or 

(iii)  a  person  who  is  neither  a  party  nor  a  party's 
officer  to  incur  substantial  expense  to  travel  more 
than 100 miles to attend trial. 

(C)  Specifying  conditions as an  alternative.--In the 
circumstances  described  in  Rule  45(c)(3)(B),  the  court 
may, instead of quashing or modifying a subpoena, order 
appearance  or  production  under  specified  conditions  if 
the serving party: 

(i)  shows  a  substantial  need  for  the  testimony  or 
material that cannot be otherwise met without undue 
hardship; and 

(ii)  ensures that the subpoenaed person will be rea-
sonably compensated. 

(d)  Duties in responding to a subpoena. 

(1)  Producing documents or electronically stored infor-
mation.--These procedures apply to producing documents 
or electronically stored information: 

(A)  Documents.--A  person  responding  to  a  subpoena 
to  produce  documents  must  produce  them  as  they  are 
kept in the ordinary course of business or must organize 
and  label  them  to  correspond  to  the  categories  in  the 
demand. 

(B)  Form  for  producing  electronically  stored  infor-
mation  not  specified.--If  a  subpoena  does not  specify a 
form for producing electronically stored information, the 
person responding must produce it in a form or forms in 
which  it  is  ordinarily  maintained  or  in  a  reasonably  us-
able form or forms. 

(C)  Electronically  stored  information  produced  in 
only  one  form.--The  person  responding  need  not 
produce  the  same  electronically  stored  information  in 
more than one form. 

(D)  Inaccessible electronically stored information.-- 
The  person  responding  need  not  provide  discovery  of

electronically  stored  information  from  sources  that  the 
person identifies as not reasonably accessible because of 
undue  burden  or  cost.  On  motion  to  compel  discovery 
or  for  a  protective  order,  the  person  responding  must 
show  that  the  information  is  not  reasonably  accessible 
because  of  undue  burden  or  cost.  If  that  showing  is 
made,  the  court  may  nonetheless  order  discovery  from 
such  sources  if  the  requesting  party  shows  good  cause, 
considering  the  limitations  of  Rule  26(b)(2)(C).  The 
court may specify conditions for the discovery. 

(2)  Claiming privilege or protection. 

(A)  In formation withheld.--A person withholding 
subpoenaed  information  under  a  claim  that  it  is  privi-
leged or subject to protection as trial-preparation mate-
rial must: 

(i)  expressly make the claim; and 
(ii)  describe  the  nature  of  the  withheld  documents, 
communications,  or  tangible  things  in  a  manner  that, 
without revealing information itself privileged or pro-
tected, will enable the parties to assess the claim. 

(B)  Information  produced.--If  information  produced 
in  response  to a  subpoena  is  subject  to  a  claim  of  privi-
lege  or  of  protection  as  trial-preparation  material,  the 
person  making  the  claim  may  notify  any  party  that  re-
ceived  the  information  of  the  claim  and  the  basis  for  it. 
After  being  notified,  a  party  must  promptly  return,  se-
quester,  or  destroy  the  specified  information  and  any 
copies  it  has;  must  not  use  or  disclose  the  information 
until  the  claim  is  resolved;  must  take  reasonable  steps 
to  retrieve  the  information  if  the  party  disclosed  it  be-
fore being notified; and may promptly present the infor-
mation to the court under seal for a determination of the 
claim.  The person  who produced  the  information must 
preserve the information until the claim is resolved. 

(e)  Contempt.--The  issuing  court  may hold  in  contempt  a 
person  who,  having  been  served,  fails  without  adequate  ex-

cuse  to  obey  the  subpoena.  A  nonparty's  failure  to  obey 
must be excused if the subpoena purports to require the non-
party  to  attend  or  produce  at  a  place  outside  the  limits  of 
Rule 45(c)(3)(A)(ii). 

Rule 46.  Objecting to a ruling or order. 

A  formal  exception  to  a  ruling  or  order  is  unnecessary. 
When the ruling or order is requested or made, a party need 
only  state  the  action  that  it  wants  the  court  to  take  or  ob-
jects to, along with the grounds for the request or objection. 
Failing to  object  does  not  prejudice  a  party  who  had  no  op-
portunity to do so when the ruling or order was made. 

Rule 47.  Selecting jurors. 

(a)  Examining jurors.--The court may permit the parties 
or  their  attorneys  to  examine  prospective  jurors  or  may  it-
self do so.  If the court examines the  jurors, it  must permit 
the parties or their attorneys to make any further inquiry it 
considers  proper,  or  must  itself  ask  any  of  their  additional 
questions it considers proper. 

(b)  Peremptory  challenges.--The  court  must  allow  the 
number  of  peremptory  challenges  provided  by  28  U. S. C. 

$ 1870. 

(c)  Excusing  a  juror.--During  trial  or  deliberation,  the 
court may excuse a juror for good cause. 

Rule 48.  Number of jurors; verdict. 

A  jury  must  initially  have  at  least  6  and  no  more  than  12 
members, and each juror must participate in the verdict un-
less  excused  under  Rule  47(c).  Unless  the  parties  stipulate 
otherwise,  the  verdict  must  be  unanimous  and  be  returned 
by a jury of at least 6 members. 

Rule 49.  Special verdict; general verdict and questions. 

(a)  Special verdict. 

(1)  In general.--The court may require a jury to return 
only a special verdict in the form of a special written find-
ing on each issue of fact.  The court may do so by: 

Date/Time: 05-12-10 16:26:21
Job: 550RUL Unit: U$CV Pagination Table: RULES1

1106  RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 

(A)  submitting written questions susceptible of a cat-
egorical or other brief answer; 

(B)  submitting  written  forms  of  the  special  findings 
that  might  properly  be  made  under  the  pleadings  and 
evidence; or 

(C)  using  any  other  method  that  the  court  considers 
appropriate. 

(2)  Instructions.--The court must give the instructions 
and explanations  necessary  to enable the  jury  to make its 
findings on each submitted issue. 

(3)  Issues  not  submitted.--A  party  waives  the  right  to 
a jury trial on any issue of fact raised by the pleadings or 
evidence  but  not  submitted  to  the  jury  unless,  before  the 
jury retires, the party demands its submission to the jury. 
If  the  party  does  not  demand  submission,  the  court  may 
make a finding on the issue.  If the court makes no finding, 
it  is  considered to have  made  a finding consistent  with its 
judgment on the special verdict. 

(b)  General  verdict  with  answers  to  written  questions. 

(1)  In general.--The court may submit to the jury forms 
for  a  general  verdict,  together  with  written  questions  on 
one or more issues of fact that the jury must decide.  The 
court  must  give  the  instructions  and  explanations  neces-
sary  to  enable  the  jury  to  render  a  general  verdict  and 
answer the  questions  in  writing, and  must direct  the  jury 
to do both. 

(2)  Verdict and answers consistent.--When the general 
verdict and the answers are consistent, the court must ap-
prove,  for  entry  under  Rule  58,  an  appropriate  judgment 
on the verdict and answers. 

(3)  Answers  inconsistent  with  the  verdict.--When  the 
answers are consistent with each other but one or more is 
inconsistent with the general verdict, the court may: 

(A)  approve, for  entry under  Rule 58,  an appropriate 
judgment according to the answers, notwithstanding the 
general verdict; 

Date/Time: 05-12-10 16:26:21

1107 RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 
(B)  direct the jury to further consider its answers and verdict; or 

(C)  order a new trial. 
(4)  Answers  inconsistent  with  each  other  and  the  ver-
dict.--When the answers are inconsistent with each other and one or more is also inconsistent with the  general ver-

dict,  judgment  must  not  be  entered;  instead,  the  court must  direct  the  jury  to  further  consider  its  answers  and 
verdict, or must order a new trial. 
Rule  50.  Judgment  as  a  matter  of  law  in  a  jury  trial;  re-

lated motion for a new trial; conditional ruling. 

(a)  Judgment as a matter of law. 

(1)  In  general.--If  a  party  has  been  fully  heard  on  an 
issue during a jury trial and the court finds that a reason-
able  jury  would  not  have  a  legally  sufficient  evidentiary 
basis to find for the party on that issue, the court may: 

(A)  resolve the issue against the party; and 
(B)  grant  a  motion  for  judgment  as  a  matter  of  law 
against  the  party  on  a  claim  or  defense  that,  under  the 
controlling law, can be maintained or defeated only with 
a favorable finding on that issue. 

(2)  Motion.--A motion for judgment as a matter of law 
may  be  made  at  any  time  before  the  case  is  submitted  to 
the  jury.  The  motion  must  specify  the  judgment  sought 
and  the  law  and  facts  that  entitle  the  movant  to  the 
judgment. 

(b)  Renewing  the  motion  after  trial;  alternative  motion 
for  a  new  trial.--If  the  court  does  not  grant  a  motion  for 
judgment  as  a  matter  of  law  made  under  Rule  50(a),  the 
court  is  considered to  have  submitted  the  action to  the  jury 
subject to the court's later deciding the legal questions raised 
by  the  motion.  No  later  than  10  days  after  the  entry  of 
judgment--or  if  the  motion  addresses  a  jury  issue  not  de-
cided  by  a  verdict,  no  later  than  10  days  after  the  jury  was 
discharged--the movant may file a renewed motion for judg-
ment  as  a  matter  of  law  and  may  include  an  alternative  or

1108  RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 
joint  request  for  a  new  trial  under  Rule  59.  In  ruling  on 
the renewed motion, the court may: 

(1)  allow  judgment  on  the  verdict,  if  the  jury  returned 
a verdict; 

(2)  order a new trial; or 
(3)  direct the entry of judgment as a matter of law. 

(c)  Granting the renewed motion; conditional ruling on a 
motion for a new trial. 

(1)  In  general.--If  the  court  grants  a  renewed  motion 
for judgment as a matter of law, it must also conditionally 
rule on any motion for a new trial by determining whether 
a  new  trial  should  be  granted  if  the  judgment  is  later  va-
cated  or  reversed.  The  court  must  state  the  grounds  for 
conditionally  granting  or  denying  the  motion  for  a  new 
trial. 

(2)  Effect o f a condi tional rul ing.--Conditi onally 
granting  the  motion  for  a  new  trial  does  not  affect  the 
judgment's  finality;  if  the  judgment  is  reversed,  the  new 
trial must proceed unless the appellate court orders other-
wise.  If the motion for a new trial is conditionally denied, 
the  appellee  may  assert  error  in  that  denial;  if  the  judg-
ment  is  reversed,  the  case  must  proceed  as  the  appellate 
court orders. 

(d)  Time for a losing party's new-trial motion.--Any mo-
tion  for a  new  trial  under  Rule  59  by  a  party  against  whom 
judgment  as  a  matter  of  law  is  rendered  must  be  filed  no 
later than 10 days after the entry of the judgment. 

(e)  Denying the motion for  judgment  as  a matter of law; 
reversal on appeal.--If the court denies the motion for judg-
ment as a matter of law, the  prevailing party may, as appel-
lee,  assert  grounds  entitling  it  to  a  new  trial  should  the  ap-
pellate  court  conclude  that  the  trial  court  erred  in  denying 
the motion.  If the appellate court reverses the judgment, it 
may  order  a  new  trial,  direct  the  trial  court  to  determine 
whether  a  new  trial  should  be  granted,  or  direct  the  entry 
of judgment.

1109 RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 
Rule  51.  Instructions  to  the  jury;  objections;  preserving  a 

claim of error. 

(a)  Requests. (

1)  Before or  at  the close  of the  evidence.--At the  close 
of  the  evidence  or  at  any  earlier  reasonable  time  that  the court  orders,  a  party  may  file  and  furnish  to  every  other 

party  written  requests  for  the  jury  instructions  it  wants the court to give. 

(2)  After  the  close  of  the  evidence.--After  the  close  of the evidence, a party may: 

(A)  file  requests  for  instructions  on  issues  that  could not reasonably have been anticipated by an earlier time 
that the court set for requests; and (B)  with the court's permission, file untimely requests 
for instructions on any issue. 
(b)  Instructions.--The court: 

(1)  must inform  the  parties  of its  proposed  instructions and proposed action on the requests before instructing the 

jury and before final jury arguments; 

(2)  must  give  the  parties  an  opportunity  to  object  on the record and out of the jury's hearing before the instruc-

tions and arguments are delivered; and (3)  may  instruct  the  jury  at  any  time  before  the  jury 
is discharged. 
(c)  Objections. 

(1)  How  to  make.--A  party  who  objects  to  an  instruc-
tion  or  the  failure  to  give  an  instruction  must  do  so  on 
the record, stating distinctly the matter objected to and the 
grounds for the objection. 

(2)  When to make.--An objection is timely if: 

(A)  a party objects at the opportunity provided under 
Rule 51(b)(2); or 

(B)  a  party  was  not  informed  of  an  instruction  or  ac-
tion  on a  request before  that  opportunity  to object, and 
the  party  objects  promptly  after  learning  that  the  in-
struction  or  request  will  be,  or  has  been,  given  or 
refused.

1110  RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 

(d)  Assigning error; plain error. 

(1)  Assigning er ror.--A party may assign  as error: 

(A)  an  error  in  an  instruction  actually  given,  if  that 
party properly objected; or 

(B)  a failure to give an instruction, if that party prop-
erly  requested  it  and--unless  the  court  rejected  the 
request  in  a  definitive  ruling  on  the  record--also  prop-
erly objected. 

(2)  Plain  error.--A court  may  consider  a  plain  error  in 
the  instructions  that  has  not  been  preserved  as  required 
by Rule 51(d)(1) if the error affects substantial rights. 

Rule  52.  Findings  and  conclusions  by  the  court;  judgment 

on partial findings. 

(a)  Findings and conclusions. 

(1)  In  general.--In  an  action  tried  on  the  facts  without 
a  jury  or  with  an  advisory  jury,  the  court  must  find  the 
facts  specially  and  state  its  conclusions  of  law  separately. 
The  findings  and  conclusions  may  be  stated  on  the  record 
after the close of the evidence or may appear in an opinion 
or  a  memorandum  of  decision  filed  by  the  court.  Judg-
ment must be entered under Rule 58. 

(2)  For an interlocutory injunction.--In granting or re-
fusing an interlocutory injunction, the court must similarly 
state  the  findings  and  conclusions  that  support  its  action. 

(3)  For  a  motion.--The  court  is  not  required  to  state 
findings  or  conclusions  when  ruling  on  a  motion  under 
Rule  12 or 56  or, unless  these rules provide  otherwise, on 
any other motion. 

(4)  Effect  of  a  master's  findings.--A  master's  findings, 
to the extent adopted by the court, must be considered the 
court's findings. 

(5)  Questioning the evidentiary support.--A party may 
later  question  the  sufficiency  of  the  evidence  supporting 
the  findings, whether  or not  the party requested findings, 
objected to them, moved to amend them, or moved for par-
tial findings.

Job: 550RUL Unit: U$CV Pagination Table: RULES1

1111 RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 
(6)  Sett ing  aside  the  findings.--Findings  of  fact, whether  based  on  oral  or  other  evidence,  must  not  be  set 

aside  unless  clearly  erroneous,  and  the  reviewing  court must  give  due  regard  to  the  trial  court's  opportunity  to 
judge the witnesses' credibility. 
(b)  Amended or additional findings.--On a party's motion 
filed  no  later  than  10  days  after  the  entry  of  judgment,  the court may amend its findings--or make additional findings-- 

and may amend the judgment accordingly.  The motion may accompany a motion for a new trial under Rule 59. 

(c)  Judgment  on  partial  findings.--If  a  party  has  been 
fully  heard  on  an  issue  during  a  nonjury  trial  and  the  court 
finds  against  the  party  on  that  issue,  the  court  may  enter 
judgment against the party on a claim or defense that, under 
the controlling law, can be maintained or defeated only with 
a  favorable  finding  on  that  issue.  The  court  may,  however, 
decline  to  render  any  judgment  until  the  close  of  the  evi-
dence.  A  judgment  on  partial  findings  must  be  supported 
by  findings  of  fact  and  conclusions  of  law  as  required  by 
Rule 52(a). 

Rule 53.  Masters. 

(a)  Appointment. 

(1)  Scope.--Unless a statute provides otherwise, a court 
may appoint a master only to: 

(A)  perform duties consented to by the parties; 
(B)  hold  trial  proceedings  and  make  or  recommend 
findings of fact on issues to be decided without a jury if 
appointment is warranted by: 

(i)  some exceptional condition; or 
(ii)  the  need  to  perform  an  accounting  or  resolve  a 
difficult computation of damages; or 

(C)  address pretrial and posttrial matters that cannot 
be  effectively and  timely  addressed  by an  available  dis-
trict judge or magistrate judge of the district. 

(2)  Disqualification.--A  master  must  not  have  a  rela-
tionship  to  the  parties,  attorneys,  action,  or  court  that

$ 455, unless the parties, with the court's approval, consent 
to the appointment after the master discloses any potential 
grounds for disqualification. 

(3)  Possible  expense or  delay.--In appointing  a master, 
the court must consider the fairness of imposing the likely 
expenses  on  the  parties  and  must  protect  against  unrea-
sonable expense or delay. 

(b)  Order appointing a master. 

(1)  Notice.--Before appointing a master, the court must 
give  the  parties  notice  and  an  opportunity  to  be  heard.

thority under Rule 53(c); 

(B)  the circumstances, if any, in which the master may 
communicate ex parte with the court or a party; 

(C)  the  nature  of  the  materials  to  be  preserved  and 
filed as the record of the master's activities; 

(D)  the  time limits,  method of filing the record, other 
procedures, and standards for reviewing the master's or-
ders, findings, and recommendations; and 

(E)  the basis, terms, and procedure for fixing the mas-
ter's compensation under Rule 53(g). 

(3)  Issuing.--The  court  may  issue  the  order  only  after: 

(A)  the  master  files  an  affidavit  disclosing  whether 
there is any ground for disqualification under 28 U. S. C. 

$ 455; and 

(B)  if  a  ground  is  disclosed,  the  parties,  with  the 
court's approval, waive the disqualification. 

(4)  Amending.--The order may be amended at any time 
after notice to the parties and an opportunity to be heard. 

(c)  Master's authority.

appointing  court's  power  to  compel,  take,  and  record 
evidence. 

(2)  Sanctions.--The  master  may  by  order  impose  on  a 
party  any  noncontempt  sanction  provided  by  Rule  37  or 
45,  and  may  recommend  a  contempt  sanction  against  a 
party and sanctions against a nonparty. 

(d)  Master's orders.--A  master who  issues an  order must 
file  it  and  promptly  serve  a  copy  on  each  party.  The  clerk 
must enter the order on the docket. 

(e)  Master's  reports.--A  master  must  report  to  the  court 
as  required  by  the  appointing  order.  The  master  must  file 
the  report  and  promptly  serve  a  copy  on  each  party,  unless 
the court orders otherwise.

recommendations. 

(1)  Opportunity  for  a  hearing;  action  in  general.--In 
acting  on  a  master's  order,  report,  or  recommendations, 
the  court must give  the  parties notice and an opportunity 
to  be  heard;  may  receive  evidence;  and  may  adopt  or  af-
firm,  modify,  wholly  or  partly  reject  or  reverse,  or  resub-
mit to the master with instructions.

may  file  objections  to--or  a  motion  to  adopt  or  modify-- 
the  master's  order,  report,  or  recommendations  no  later

a different time. 

(3)  Reviewing factual findings.--The court must decide 
de  novo  all  objections  to  findings  of  fact  made  or  recom-
mended  by  a  master,  unless  the  parties,  with  the  court's 
approval, stipulate that:

1114  RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 

(A)  the  findings  will  be  reviewed  for  clear  error;  or

53(a)(1)(A) or (C) will be final. 

(4)  Reviewing  legal  conclusions.--The  court  must  de-
cide  de  novo  all  objections  to  conclusions  of  law  made  or 
recommended by a master. 

(5)  Rev iewing procedural matters.--Unless the ap-
pointing  order  establishes  a  different  standard  of  review, 
the  court  may  set  aside  a  master's  ruling  on  a  procedural 
matter only for an abuse of discretion. 

( g)  Compensation. 

(1)  Fixing  compensation.--Before  or  after  judgment, 
the  court must fix the  master's compensation on  the  basis 
and  terms  stated  in  the  appointing  order,  but  the  court 
may  set  a  new  basis and  terms  after  giving notice  and  an 
opportunity to be heard. 

(2)  Payment.--The  compensation  must  be  paid  either:

(B)  from a fund or subject matter of the action within 
the court's control. 

(3)  Allocating  payment.--The  court  must  allocate  pay-
ment  among  the  parties  after  considering  the  nature  and 
amount of the controversy, the parties' means, and the ex-
tent  to  which  any  party  is  more  responsible  than  other 
parties  for  the  reference  to  a  master.  An  interim  alloca-
tion  may  be  amended  to  reflect  a  decision  on  the  merits. 

(h)  Appointing  a  magistrate  judge.--A  magistrate  judge 
is subject to this rule only when the order referring a matter 
to  the  magistrate  judge  states  that  the  reference  is  made 
under this rule.

A  judgment  should  not  include  recitals  of  pleadings,  a  mas-ter's report, or a record of prior proceedings. 

(b)  Judgment  on  multiple  claims  or  involving  multiple 
parties.--When  an  action  presents  more  than  one  claim  for 
relief--whether  as  a  claim,  counterclaim,  crossclaim,  or third-party claim--or when multiple parties are involved, the 

court may direct entry of a final judgment as to one or more, but  fewer  than  all,  claims  or  parties  only  if  the  court  ex-
pressly  determines  that  there  is  no  just  reason  for  delay. Otherwise, any order or other decision, however designated, 
that  adjudicates  fewer  than  all  the  claims  or  the  rights  and 
liabilities of fewer than all the parties does not end the action as to any of the claims or parties and may be revised at any 

time  before  the  entry  of  a  judgment  adjudicating  all  the claims and all the parties' rights and liabilities. 

(c)  Demand for judgment; relief to be granted.--A default judgment must not differ in kind from, or exceed in amount, 
what is demanded in the pleadings.  Every other final judg-ment  should  grant  the  relief  to  which  each  party  is  enti-
tled,  even  if  the  party  has  not  demanded  that  relief  in  its pleadings. 

(d)  Costs; attorney's fees. (

1)  Costs  other  than  attorney's  fees.--Unless  a  federal 
statute,  these  rules,  or  a  court  order  provides  otherwise, 
costs--other  than  attorney's  fees--should  be  allowed  to the prevailing party.  But costs against the United States, 

its  officers,  and  its  agencies  may  be  imposed  only  to  the extent allowed by law.  The clerk may tax costs on 1 day's 
notice.  On  motion  served  within  the  next  5  days,  the court may review the clerk's action. 

(2)  Attorney's fees. (

A)  Claim  to  be  by  motion.--A  claim  for  attorney's 
fees  and  related  nontaxable  expenses  must  be  made  by motion unless the substantive law requires those fees to 

be proved at trial as an element of damages. 

(B)  Timing  and  contents  of  the  motion.--Unless  a 
statute or a court  order  provides otherwise,  the motion 
must:

1116  RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 

(i)  be  filed  no  later  than  14  days  after  the  entry  of judgment; 

(ii)  specify  the  judgment  and  the  statute,  rule,  or other  grounds  entitling  the  movant  to  the  award; 
(iii)  state the amount  sought  or provide  a fair  esti-mate of it; and 
(iv)  disclose, if the court so orders, the terms of any agreement  about  fees  for  the  services  for  which  the 
claim is made. 
(C)  Proceedings.--Subject  to  Rule  23(h),  the  court must,  on  a  party's  request,  give  an  opportunity  for  ad-

versary  submissions  on  the  motion  in  accordance  with Rule 43(c) or 78.  The court may decide  issues of liabil-
ity for fees before receiving submissions on the value of services.  The  court  must  find  the  facts  and  state  its 
conclusions of law as provided in Rule 52(a). (D)  Special  procedures  by  local  rule;  reference  to  a 
master  or  a magistrate  judge.--By local rule, the  court may  establish  special  procedures  to  resolve  fee-related 
issues  without  extensive  evidentiary  hearings.  Also, the court may refer issues concerning the value of serv-
ices to a special master under Rule 53 without regard to the  limitations  of  Rule  53(a)(1),  and  may  refer  a  motion 
for  attorney's  fees  to  a  magistrate  judge  under  Rule 72(b) as if it were a dispositive pretrial matter. 

(E )  Excep tions.--Subparagraphs  (A)-(D) do not apply  to  claims  for  fees  and  expenses  as  sanctions  for 
violating  these  rules  or  as  sanctions  under  28  U. S. C. $ 1927. 

Rule 55.  Default; default judgment. 

(a)  Entering  a  default.--When  a  party  against  whom  a judgment  for  affirmative  relief  is  sought  has  failed  to  plead 

or otherwise defend, and that failure is shown by affidavit or otherwise, the clerk must enter the party's default. 

(b)  Entering a default judgment. (

1)  By  the  clerk.--If  the  plaintiff 's  claim  is  for  a  sum certain or a sum that can be made certain by computation, 

the  clerk--on  the  plaintiff 's  request,  with  an  affidavit

1117 RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 
showing  the  amount  due--must  enter  judgment  for  that 
amount  and  costs  against  a  defendant  who  has  been  de-
faulted  for  not  appearing  and  who  is  neither  a  minor  nor 
an incompetent person. 

(2)  By  the  court.--In  all  other  cases,  the  party  must 
apply to the court for a default judgment.  A default judg-
ment may be entered against a minor or incompetent per-
son only if represented by a general guardian, conservator, 
or  other  like  fiduciary  who  has  appeared.  If  the  party 
against  whom  a  default  judgment  is  sought  has  appeared 
personally  or  by  a  representative,  that  party  or  its  rep-
resentative  must  be  served  with  written  notice  of  the  ap-
plication  at  least  3  days  before  the  hearing.  The  court 
may  conduct  hearings  or  make  referrals--preserving  any 
federal  statutory  right  to  a  jury  trial--when,  to  enter  or 
effectuate judgment, it needs to: 

(A)  conduct an accounting; 
(B)  determine the amount of damages; 
(C)  establish  the  truth  of  any  allegation  by  evidence; 
or 

(D)  investigate any other matter. 

(c)  Setting  aside  a  default  or  a  default  judgment.--The 
court  may  set  aside  an  entry  of  default  for  good  cause,  and 
it may set aside a default judgment under Rule 60(b). 

(d)  Judgment against the United States.--A default judg-
ment  may be  entered against  the  United  States,  its  officers, 
or  its  agencies  only  if  the  claimant  establishes  a  claim  or 
right to relief by evidence that satisfies the court. 

Rule 56.  Summary judgment. 

(a)  By  a  claiming  party.--A  party  claiming  relief  may 
move,  with  or  without  supporting  affidavits,  for  summary 
judgment  on  all  or  part  of  the  claim.  The  motion  may  be 
filed at any time after: 

(1)  20  days  have  passed  from  commencement  of  the  ac-
tion; or 

(2)  the  opposing  party  serves  a  motion  for  summary 
judgment.

1118  RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 

(b)  By a defending party.--A party against whom relief is 
sought  may  move  at  any  time,  with  or  without  supporting 
affidavits, for summary judgment on all or part of the claim. 

(c)  Serving the motion; proceedings.--The motion must be 
served  at  least  10  days  before  the  day  set  for  the  hearing. 
An opposing  party may  serve  opposing  affidavits  before  the 
hearing  day.  The  judgment  sought  should  be  rendered  if 
the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, 
and  any  affidavits  show  that  there  is  no  genuine  issue  as  to 
any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment 
as a matter of law. 

(d)  Case not fully adjudicated on the motion. 

(1)  Establishing  facts.--If  summary  judgment  is  not 
rendered  on the  whole  action,  the court  should, to the  ex-
tent  practicable,  determine  what  material  facts  are  not 
genuinely at issue.  The court should so determine by ex-
amining the pleadings and evidence before it and by inter-
rogating  the  attorneys.  It  should  then  issue  an  order 
specifying  what  facts--including  items  of  damages  or 
other  relief--are  not  genuinely  at  issue.  The  facts  so 
specified  must  be  treated  as  established  in  the  action. 

(2)  Establishing  liability.--An  interlocutory  summary 
judgment may be rendered on liability alone, even if there 
is a genuine issue on the amount of damages. 

(e)  Affidavits; further testimony. 

(1)  In  general.--A  supporting  or  opposing  affidavit 
must  be  made  on  personal  knowledge,  set  out  facts  that 
would be admissible in evidence, and show that the affiant 
is  competent  to  testify  on  the  matters  stated.  If  a  paper 
or  part  of  a  paper  is  referred  to  in  an  affidavit,  a  sworn 
or  certified  copy  must  be  attached  to  or  served  with  the 
affidavit.  The court may permit an affidavit to be supple-
mented or opposed by depositions, answers to interrogato-
ries, or additional affidavits. 

(2)  Opposing  party's  obligation  to  respond.--When  a 
motion  for  summary  judgment  is  properly  made  and  sup-
ported,  an  opposing  party  may  not  rely  merely  on  allega-

tions  or  denials  in  its  own  pleading;  rather,  its  response 
must--by affidavits or as otherwise provided in this rule-- 
set out specific facts showing a genuine issue for trial.  If 
the  opposing  party  does  not  so  respond,  summary  judg-
ment should, if appropriate, be entered against that party. 

( f )  When  affidavits  are  unavailable.--If  a  party  oppos-
ing the motion shows by affidavit that, for specified reasons, 
it cannot present facts essential to justify its opposition, the 
court may: 

(1)  deny the motion; 
(2)  order  a  continuance  to  enable  affidavits  to  be  ob-
tained,  depositions  to  be  taken,  or  other  discovery  to  be 
undertaken; or 

(3)  issue any other just order. 

( g)  Affidavit  submitted  in  bad  faith.--If  satisfied  that  an 
affidavit  under  this  rule  is  submitted  in  bad  faith  or  solely 
for  delay,  the  court  must  order  the  submitting  party  to  pay 
the other party the reasonable expenses, including attorney's 
fees, it incurred as a result.  An offending party or attorney 
may also be held in contempt. 

Rule 57.  Declaratory judgment. 

These rules govern the procedure for obtaining a declara-
tory  judgment  under  28  U. S. C.  $ 2201.  Rules  38  and  39 
govern  a demand  for  a jury trial.  The  existence  of another 
adequate  remedy  does  not  preclude  a  declaratory  judgment 
that  is  otherwise  appropriate.  The  court  may  order  a 
speedy hearing of a declaratory-judgment action. 

Rule 58.  Entering judgment. 

(a)  Separate  document.--Every  judgment  and  amended 
judgment must be set out in a separate document, but a sep-
arate  document  is  not  required  for  an  order  disposing  of  a 
motion: 

(1)  for judgment under Rule 50(b); 
(2)  to  amend  or  make  additional  findings  under  Rule 
52(b); 

Date/Time: 05-12-10 16:26:21

1120  RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 

(3)  for attorney's fees under Rule 54; (4)  for  a  new  trial,  or  to  alter  or  amend  the  judgment, 

under Rule 59; or (5)  for relief under Rule 60. 

(b)  Entering judgment. (1)  Without the court's direction.--Subject  to  Rule 
54(b)  and  unless  the  court  orders  otherwise,  the  clerk must, without awaiting the court's direction, promptly pre-
pare, sign, and enter the judgment when: (A)  the jury returns a general verdict; 

(B)  the  court  awards  only  costs  or  a  sum  certain;  or (C)  the court denies all relief. 

(2)  Court's  approval  required.--Subject  to  Rule  54(b), the  court  must  promptly  approve  the  form  of  the  judg-
ment, which the clerk must promptly enter, when: (A)  the  jury  returns  a  special  verdict  or  a  general 

verdict with answers to written questions; or 

(B)  the  court  grants  other  relief  not  described  in this subdivision (b). 

(c)  Time of entry.--For purposes of these rules, judgment 
is entered at the following times: 

(1)  if  a  separate  document  is  not  required,  when  the judgment is entered in the civil docket under Rule 79(a); or 

(2)  if  a  separate  document  is  required,  when  the  judg-ment  is  entered  in  the  civil  docket  under  Rule  79(a)  and 
the earlier of these events occurs: (A)  it is set out in a separate document; or 

(B)  150  days  have  run  from  the  entry  in  the  civil docket. 

(d)  Request  for  entry.--A  party  may  request  that  judg-ment  be  set  out  in  a  separate  document  as  required  by 
Rule 58(a). (

e)  Cost or fee awards.--Ordinarily, the entry of judgment 
may  not  be  delayed,  nor  the  time  for  appeal  extended,  in order to tax costs or award fees.  But if a timely motion for 

attorney's  fees  is  made  under  Rule  54(d)(2),  the  court  may

1121 RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 
act before a notice of appeal has been filed and become effec-
tive  to  order  that  the  motion  have  the  same  effect  under 
Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure  4(a)(4) as a timely  mo-
tion under Rule 59. 

Rule 59.  New trial; altering or amending a judgment. 

(a)  In general. 

(1)  Grounds  for  new  trial.--The  court  may,  on  motion, 
grant a  new trial on all  or some of the  issues--and to any 
party--as follows: 

(A)  after a  jury trial, for  any reason for  which  a  new 
trial  has  heretofore  been  granted  in  an  action  at  law  in 
federal court; or 

(B)  after  a  nonjury  trial,  for  any  reason  for  which  a 
rehearing has heretofore been granted in a suit in equity 
in federal court. 

(2)  Further action after a nonjury trial.--After a non-
jury  trial,  the  court  may,  on  motion  for  a  new  trial,  open 
the judgment if one has been entered, take additional tes-
timony,  amend  findings  of  fact  and  conclusions  of  law  or 
make  new  ones,  and  direct  the  entry  of  a  new  judgment. 

(b)  Time  to  file  a  motion  for  a  new  trial.--A  motion  for 
a new trial must be filed no later than 10 days after the entry 
of judgment. 

(c)  Time  to  serve  affidavits.--When  a  motion  for  a  new 
trial  is  based  on  affidavits,  they  must  be  filed  with  the  mo-
tion.  The opposing party has 10 days after being served to 
file opposing affidavits; but that period may be extended for 
up  to  20  days,  either  by  the  court  for  good  cause  or  by  the 
parties'  stipulation.  The  court  may  permit  reply  affidavits. 

(d)  New  trial  on  the  court's  initiative  or  for  reasons  not 
in  the  motion.--No  later  than  10  days  after  the  entry  of 
judgment,  the  court,  on  its  own,  may  order  a  new  trial  for 
any  reason  that  would  justify  granting  one  on  a  party's  mo-
tion.  After  giving the  parties  notice  and  an opportunity  to 
be heard, the court may grant a timely motion for a new trial 

Date/Time: 05-12-10 16:26:21
Job: 550RUL Unit: U$CV Pagination Table: RULES1

1122  RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 
for  a  reason  not  stated  in  the  motion.  In  either  event,  the 
court must specify the reasons in its order. 

(e)  Motion  to  alter  or  amend  a  judgment.--A  motion  to 
alter  or  amend  a  judgment  must  be  filed  no  later  than  10 
days after the entry of the judgment. 

Rule 60.  Relief from a judgment or order. 

(a)  Corrections  based  on  clerical  mistakes;  oversights 
and omissions.--The court may correct a clerical mistake or 
a  mistake  arising  from  oversight  or  omission  whenever  one 
is  found  in  a  judgment,  order,  or  other  part  of  the  record. 
The court may do so on motion or on its own, with or without 
notice.  But after an appeal has been docketed in the appel-
late  court  and  while  it  is  pending,  such  a  mistake  may  be 
corrected only with the appellate court's leave. 

(b)  Grounds  for  relief  from  a  final  judgment,  order,  or 
proceeding.--On  motion  and  just  terms,  the  court  may  re-
lieve  a  party  or  its  legal  representative  from  a  final  judg-
ment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons: 

(1)  mistake,  inadvertence,  surprise,  or  excusable 
neglect; 

(2)  newly discovered evidence that, with reasonable dili-
gence, could not have been discovered in time to move for 
a new trial under Rule 59(b); 

(3)  fraud  (whether  previously  called  intrinsic  or  extrin-
sic), misrepresentation, or misconduct by an opposing 

party; 

(4)  the judgment is void; 
(5)  the  judgment  has  been  satisfied,  released  or  dis-
charged;  it  is  based  on  an  earlier  judgment  that  has  been 
reversed  or  vacated;  or  applying  it  prospectively  is  no 
longer equitable; or 

(6)  any other reason that justifies relief. 

(c)  Timing and effect of the motion. 

(1)  Timing.--A  motion  under  Rule  60(b)  must  be  made 
within  a  reasonable  time--and  for  reasons  (1),  (2),  and 
(3) no more than a year after the entry of the judgment or 
order or the date of the proceeding.

Job: 550RUL Unit: U$CV Pagination Table: RULES1

1123 RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 
(2)  Effect  on  finality.--The  motion  does  not  affect  the judgment's finality or suspend its operation. 

(d)  Other powers to grant relief.--This rule does not limit a court's power to: 

(1)  entertain  an  independent  action  to  relieve  a  party from a judgment, order, or proceeding; 
(2)  grant  relief  under  28  U. S. C.  $ 1655  to  a  defendant who was not personally notified of the action; or 
(3)  set aside a judgment for fraud on the court. 
(e)  Bills  and  writs  abolished.--The  following  are  abol-
ished:  bills  of  review,  bills  in  the  nature  of  bills  of  review, 
and  writs  of  coram  nobis,  coram  vobis,  and  audita  querela. 

Rule 61.  Harmless error. 

Unless justice requires otherwise, no error in admitting or 
excluding  evidence--or  any  other  error  by  the  court  or  a 
party--is  ground  for  granting  a  new  trial,  for  setting  aside 
a  verdict,  or  for  vacating,  modifying,  or  otherwise  disturb-
ing a judgment or order.  At every stage of the proceeding, 
the  court  must  disregard  all  errors  and  defects  that  do  not 
affect any party's substantial rights. 

Rule 62.  Stay of proceedings to enforce a judgment. 

(a)  Automatic  stay;  exceptions  for  injunctions,  receiver-
ships,  and  patent  accountings.--Except  as  stated  in  this 
rule,  no  execution  may  issue  on  a  judgment,  nor  may  pro-
ceedings  be  taken  to  enforce  it,  until  10  days  have  passed 
after  its  entry.  But  unless  the  court  orders  otherwise,  the 
following  are  not  stayed  after  being  entered,  even  if  an  ap-
peal is taken: 

(1)  an  interlocutory  or  final  judgment  in  an  action  for 
an injunction or a receivership; or 

(2)  a judgment or order that directs an accounting in an 
action for patent infringement. 

(b)  Stay  pending the  disposition of a motion.--On  appro-
priate terms for the opposing party's security, the court may 
stay the execution of a judgment--or any proceedings to en-
force it--pending disposition of any of the following motions:

1124  RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 

(1)  under  Rule  50,  for  judgment  as  a  matter  of  law; 
(2)  under Rule  52(b),  to  amend the  findings or  for addi-
tional findings; 

(3)  under  Rule  59,  for  a  new  trial  or  to  alter  or  amend 
a judgment; or 

(4)  under  Rule  60,  for  relief  from  a  judgment  or  order. 

(c)  Injunction  pending  an  appeal.--While  an  appeal  is 
pending  from  an  interlocutory  order  or  final  judgment  that 
grants, dissolves, or denies an injunction, the court may sus-
pend,  modify,  restore,  or  grant  an  injunction  on  terms  for 
bond or other terms that secure the opposing party's rights. 
If  the  judgment  appealed  from  is  rendered  by  a  statutory 
three-judge  district  court,  the  order  must  be  made  either: 

(1)  by that court sitting in open session; or 
(2)  by  the  assent  of  all  its  judges,  as  evidenced  by 
their signatures. 

(d)  Stay  with  bond  on  appeal.--If an  appeal is  taken, the 
appellant  may  obtain  a  stay  by  supersedeas  bond,  except  in 
an  action  described  in  Rule  62(a)(1)  or  (2).  The  bond  may 
be  given  upon  or  after  filing  the  notice  of  appeal  or  after 
obtaining the order allowing the appeal.  The stay takes ef-
fect when the court approves the bond. 

(e)  Stay without bond on an appeal by  the United States, 
its  officers,  or  its  agencies.--The  court  must  not  require  a 
bond,  obligation,  or  other  security  from  the  appellant  when 
granting  a  stay  on  an  appeal  by  the  United  States,  its  offi-
cers, or its agencies or on an appeal directed by a department 
of the federal government. 

( f )  Stay in favor of a judgment debtor under state law.-- 
If  a  judgment  is  a  lien  on  the  judgment  debtor's  property 
under  the  law  of  the  state  where  the  court  is  located,  the 
judgment  debtor  is  entitled  to  the  same  stay  of  execution 
the state court would give. 

( g)  Appellate  court's  power  not  limited.--This  rule  does 
not limit the power of the appellate court or one of its judges 
or justices:

1125 RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 
(1)  to stay proceedings--or suspend, modify, restore, or grant  an  injunction--while  an  appeal  is  pending;  or 

(2)  to  issue  an  order  to  preserve  the  status  quo  or  the effectiveness of the judgment to be entered. 

(h)  Stay  with  multiple  claims  or  parties.--A  court  may stay the enforcement of a final judgment entered under Rule 
54(b) until it enters a later judgment or judgments, and may prescribe terms necessary to secure the benefit of the stayed 
judgment for the party in whose favor it was entered. 
Rule 63.  Judge's inability to proceed. 

If  a  judge  conducting  a  hearing  or  trial  is  unable  to  pro-ceed, any other judge may proceed upon certifying familiar-

ity  with  the  record  and  determining  that  the  case  may  be completed without prejudice to the parties.  In a hearing or 
a  nonjury  trial,  the  successor  judge  must,  at  a  party's  re-quest,  recall  any  witness  whose  testimony  is  material  and 
disputed and who is available to testify again without undue burden.  The  successor  judge  may  also  recall  any  other 
witness.

1127 RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 
(3)  Expediting the preliminary-injunction hearing.--If 
the order is issued without notice, the motion for a prelimi-
nary injunction must be set for hearing at the earliest pos-
sible time, taking precedence over all other matters except 
hearings  on  older  matters  of  the  same  character.  At  the 
hearing,  the  party  who  obtained  the  order  must  proceed 
with the motion; if the party does not, the court must dis-
solve the order. 

(4)  Motion  to  dissolve.--On  2  days'  notice  to  the  party 
who  obtained  the  order  without  notice--or  on  shorter  no-
tice  set  by  the  court--the  adverse  party  may  appear  and 
move  to  dissolve  or  modify  the  order.  The  court  must 
then  hear  and  decide  the  motion  as  promptly  as  justice 
requires. 

(c)  Security.--The  court  may  issue  a  preliminary  injunc-
tion  or  a  temporary  restraining  order  only  if  the  movant 
gives  security  in  an  amount  that  the  court  considers  proper 
to pay the costs and damages sustained by any party found to 
have  been  wrongfully  enjoined  or  restrained.  The  United 
States,  its  officers,  and  its  agencies  are  not  required  to  give 
security. 

(d)  Contents  and  scope  of  every  injunction  and  restrain-
ing order. 

(1)  Contents.--Every  order  granting  an  injunction  and 
every restraining order must: 

(A)  state the reasons why it issued; 
(B)  state its terms specifically; and 
(C)  describe  in  reasonable  detail--and  not  by  refer-
ring to the complaint or other document--the act or acts 
restrained or required. 

(2)  Persons bound.--The order binds only the following 
who  receive  actual  notice  of  it  by  personal  service  or 
otherwise: 

(A)  the parties; 
(B)  the  parties'  officers,  agents,  servants,  employees, 
and attorneys; and

(C)  other persons who are in active concert or partici-
pation with anyone described in Rule 65(d)(2)(A) or (B). 

(e)  Other  laws  not  modified.--These  rules  do  not  modify 
the following: 

(1)  any federal statute relating to temporary restraining 
orders  or  preliminary  injunctions  in  actions  affecting  em-
ployer and employee; 

(2)  28  U. S. C.  $ 2361,  which  relates  to  preliminary  in-
junctions  in  actions  of  interpleader  or  in  the  nature  of 
interpleader; or 

(3)  28 U. S. C. $ 2284, which relates to actions that must 
be heard and decided by a three-judge district court. 

( f )  Copyr i ght  impoundment.--This  rule  applies  to 
copyright-impoundment proceedings. 

Rule 65.1.  Proceedings against a surety. 

Whenever  these  rules  (including  the  Supplemental  Rules 
for  Admiralty  or  Maritime  Claims  and  Asset  Forfeiture  Ac-
tions) require or allow a party to give security, and security 
is  given  through  a  bond  or  other  undertaking  with  one  or 
more sureties, each surety submits to the court's jurisdiction 
and  irrevocably  appoints  the  court  clerk  as  its  agent  for  re-
ceiving  service  of  any  papers  that  affect  its  liability  on  the 
bond or undertaking.  The surety's liability may be enforced 
on  motion  without  an  independent  action.  The  motion  and 
any notice that the court orders may be served on the court 
clerk, who must promptly mail a copy of each to every surety 
whose address is known. 

Rule 66.  Receivers. 

These rules govern an action in which the appointment of 
a  receiver  is  sought  or  a  receiver  sues  or  is  sued.  But  the 
practice in administering an estate by a receiver or a similar 
court-appointed officer must accord with the historical prac-
tice  in  federal  courts  or  with  a  local  rule.  An  action  in 
which  a  receiver  has  been  appointed  may  be  dismissed  only 
by court order.

1129 RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 
Rule 67.  Deposit into court. 

(a)  Depositing  property.--If  any  part  of  the  relief  sought is a money judgment or the disposition of a sum of money or 

some  other  deliverable  thing,  a  party--on  notice  to  every other  party  and  by  leave  of  court--may  deposit  with  the 
court  all or  part  of  the money  or  thing,  whether or  not  that party  claims  any  of  it.  The  depositing  party  must  deliver 
to the clerk a copy of the order permitting deposit. (

b)  Investing  and  withdrawing  funds.--Money  paid  into court  under  this  rule  must  be  deposited  and  withdrawn  in 

accordance  with  28  U. S. C.  $$ 2041  and  2042  and  any  like statute.  The  money  must  be  deposited  in  an  interest-
bearing  account  or  invested  in  a  court-approved,  interest-bearing instrument. 

Rule 68.  Offer of judgment. 

(a)  Making  an  offer;  judgment  on  an  accepted  offer.-- More than 10 days before the trial begins, a party defending 

against  a  claim  may  serve  on  an  opposing  party  an  offer  to allow  judgment  on  specified  terms,  with  the  costs  then  ac-
crued.  If,  within  10  days  after  being  served,  the  opposing party serves written notice accepting  the offer, either party 
may  then  file  the  offer  and  notice  of  acceptance,  plus  proof of service.  The clerk must then enter judgment. 

(b)  Unaccepted  offer.--An  unaccepted  offer  is  considered withdrawn, but it does not preclude a later offer.  Evidence 
of an unaccepted offer is not admissible except in a proceed-ing to determine costs. 

(c)  Offer after liability is determined.--When one party's liability to another has been determined but the extent of lia-
bility  remains  to  be  determined  by  further  proceedings,  the party  held  liable  may  make  an  offer  of  judgment.  It  must 
be  served  within  a  reasonable  time--but  at  least  10  days-- before a hearing to determine the extent of liability. 

(d)  Paying  costs  after  an  unaccepted  offer.--If  the  judg-ment  that  the  offeree  finally  obtains  is  not  more  favorable 
than  the  unaccepted  offer,  the  offeree  must  pay  the  costs 
incurred after the offer was made.

1130  RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 
Rule 69.  Execution. 

(a)  In general. 

(1)  Money  judgment;  applicable  procedure.--A  money 
judgment  is  enforced  by  a  writ  of  execution,  unless  the 
court  directs  otherwise.  The  procedure  on  execution-- 
and  in  proceedings  supplementary  to  and  in  aid  of  judg-
ment or execution--must accord with the procedure of the 
state where the court is located, but a federal statute gov-
erns to the extent it applies. 

(2)  Obtaining discovery.--In aid of the judgment or ex-
ecution,  the  judgment  creditor  or  a  successor  in  interest 
whose  interest  appears  of  record  may  obtain  discovery 
from any person--including the judgment debtor--as pro-
vided in these rules or by the procedure of the state where 
the court is located. 

(b)  Against certain public officers.--When a judgment has 
been  entered  against  a  revenue  officer  in  the  circumstances 
stated in 28  U. S. C. $ 2006, or against an officer  of Congress 
in  the circumstances stated  in 2  U. S. C. $ 118, the  judgment 
must be satisfied as those statutes provide. 

Rule 70.  Enforcing a judgment for a specific act. 

(a)  Party's  failure  to  act;  ordering  another  to  act.--If  a 
judgment  requires a  party  to convey  land,  to  deliver a  deed 
or  other  document,  or  to  perform  any  other  specific  act  and 
the party fails to comply within the time specified, the court 
may order the act to be done--at the disobedient party's ex-
pense--by  another  person  appointed  by  the  court.  When 
done, the act has the same effect as if done by the party. 

(b)  Vesting  title.--If  the  real  or  personal  property  is 
within the district, the court--instead of ordering a convey-
ance--may  enter  a  judgment  divesting  any  party's  title  and 
vesting  it  in  others.  That  judgment  has  the  effect  of  a  le-
gally executed conveyance. 

(c)  Obtaining a writ of attachment or sequestration.--On 
application by a  party entitled to performance of an act, the

1131 RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 
clerk  must  issue  a  writ  of  attachment  or  sequestration against the disobedient party's property to compel obedience. 

(d)  Obtaining  a  writ  of  execution  or  assistance.--On application  by  a  party  who  obtains  a  judgment  or  order 
for  possession,  the  clerk  must  issue  a  writ  of  execution  or assistance. 

(e)  Holding  in  contempt.--The  court  may  also  hold  the disobedient party in contempt. 

Rule 71.  Enforcing relief for or against a nonparty. 

When  an order grants  relief for  a nonparty or may  be en-forced  against  a  nonparty,  the  procedure  for  enforcing  the 

order is the same as for a party.

1132  RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 

(3)  Parties.--When  the  action  commences,  the  plaintiff need  join  as  defendants  only  those  persons  who  have  or 

claim  an  interest  in  the  property  and  whose  names  are then  known.  But  before  any  hearing  on  compensation, 
the plaintiff must add as defendants all those persons who have  or  claim  an  interest  and  whose  names  have  become 
known  or  can  be  found  by  a  reasonably  diligent  search  of the records, considering both the property's character and 
value  and  the  interests  to  be  acquired.  All  others  may be  made  defendants  under  the  designation  "Unknown 
Owners." (

4)  Procedure.--Notice  must  be  served  on  all  defend-ants as provided in Rule 71.1(d), whether they were named 

as  defendants  when  the  action  commenced  or  were  added later.  A  defendant  may  answer  as  provided  in  Rule 
71.1(e).  The court, meanwhile, may order any distribution of a deposit that the facts warrant. 

(5)  Filing;  additional  copies.--In  addition  to  filing  the complaint,  the  plaintiff  must  give  the  clerk  at  least  one 
copy  for  the  defendants'  use  and  additional  copies  at  the request of the clerk or a defendant. 

(d)  Process. (1)  Delivering  notice  to  the  clerk.--On  filing  a  com-
plaint, the plaintiff must promptly deliver to the clerk joint or  several  notices  directed  to  the  named  defendants. 
When  adding  defendants,  the  plaintiff  must  deliver to  the clerk additional notices directed to the new defendants. 

(2)  Contents of the notice. (

A)  Main contents.--Each notice must name the court, the title of the action, and the defendant to whom 

it is directed.  It must describe the property sufficiently to  identify  it,  but  need  not  describe  any  property  other 
than  that  to  be  taken  from  the  named  defendant.  The notice must also state: 

(i)  that the action is to condemn property; (ii)  the interest to be taken; 
(iii)  the authority for the taking; (iv)  the uses for which the property is to be taken; 

Date/Time: 05-12-10 16:26:21

1133 RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 
(v)  that  the  defendant  may  serve an  answer on  the 
plaintiff 's  attorney  within  20  days  after  being  served 
with the notice; 

(vi)  that  the  failure  to  so  serve  an  answer  consti-
tutes  consent  to  the  taking  and  to  the  court's  author-
ity  to  proceed  with  the  action  and  fix  the  compensa-
tion; and 

(vii)  that a defendant who does not serve an answer 
may file a notice of appearance. 

(B)  Conclusion.--The  notice  must  conclude  with  the 
name, telephone number, and e-mail address of the plain-
tiff 's  attorney  and  an  address  within  the  district  in 
which  the  action  is  brought where  the  attorney may  be 
served. 

(3)  Serving the notice. 

(A)  Personal  service.--When  a  defendant  whose  ad-
dress  is  known  resides  within  the  United  States  or  a 
territory  subject  to  the  administrative  or  judicial  juris-
diction  of the  United States,  personal service of the  no-
tice  (without  a  copy  of  the  complaint)  must  be  made  in 
accordance with Rule 4. 

(B)  Service by publication. 

(i)  A  defendant  may  be  served  by  publication  only 
when the  plaintiff 's attorney files a  certificate stating 
that  the  attorney  believes  the  defendant  cannot  be 
personally  served,  because  after  diligent  inquiry 
within  the  state  where  the  complaint  is  filed,  the  de-
fendant's  place  of  residence  is  still  unknown  or,  if 
known,  that  it  is  beyond  the  territorial  limits  of  per-
sonal service.  Service is then made by publishing the 
notice--once  a  week  for  at  least  three  successive 
weeks--in a newspaper published in the county where 
the property is located or, if there is no such newspa-
per,  in  a  newspaper  with  general  circulation  where 
the  property  is  located.  Before  the  last  publication, 
a  copy  of  the  notice  must  also  be  mailed  to  every  de-
fendant  who  cannot  be  personally  served  but  whose

1134  RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 

place  of  residence  is  then  known.  Unknown  owners may  be  served  by  publication  in  the  same  manner  by 

a notice addressed to "Unknown Owners." (ii)  Service  by  publication  is  complete  on  the  date 
of  the  last  publication.  The  plaintiff 's  attorney  must prove  publication  and  mailing  by  a  certificate,  attach 
a  printed  copy  of  the  published  notice,  and  mark  on the  copy  the  newspaper's  name  and  the  dates  of 
publication. 
(4)  Effect  of  delivery  and  service.--Delivering  the  no-
tice  to  the  clerk  and  serving  it  have  the  same  effect  as serving a summons under Rule 4. 

(5)  Proof  of  service;  amending  the  proof  or  notice.-- Rule 4(

l) governs proof of service.  The court may permit 
the proof or the notice to be amended. 

(e)  Appearance or answer. 

(1)  Notice of appearance.--A defendant that has  no ob-jection or defense  to the  taking of its property  may serve 

a  notice  of  appearance  designating  the  property  in  which 
it  claims  an  interest.  The  defendant  must  then  be  given notice of all later proceedings affecting the defendant. 

(2)  Answer.--A  defendant  that  has  an  objection  or  de-fense  to  the  taking  must  serve  an  answer  within  20  days 
after  being  served  with  the  notice.  The  answer  must: 

(A)  identify  the  property  in  which  the  defendant 
claims an interest; 

(B)  state  the  nature  and  extent  of  the  interest;  and 
(C)  state  all  the  defendant's  objections  and  defenses 
to the taking. 

(3)  Waiver  of  other  objections  and  defenses;  evidence 
on compensation.--A defendant waives all objections and 
defenses  not  stated  in  its  answer.  No  other  pleading  or 
motion  asserting  an  additional  objection  or  defense  is  al-
lowed.  But  at  the  trial  on  compensation,  a  defendant-- 
whether  or  not  it  has  previously  appeared  or  answered-- 
may  present  evidence  on  the  amount  of  compensation  to 
be paid and may share in the award.

1135 RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 
( f )  Amending  pleadings.--Without  leave  of  court,  the plaintiff may--as often as it wants--amend the complaint at 

any  time  before  the  trial  on  compensation.  But  no  amend-ment may be made if it would result in a dismissal inconsist-
ent  with Rule  71.1(i)(1) or  (2).  The plaintiff  need  not  serve a copy  of an amendment, but must serve notice  of the filing, 
as  provided  in  Rule  5(b),  on  every  affected  party  who  has appeared and, as provided  in Rule  71.1(d), on every  affected 
party who has not appeared.  In addition, the plaintiff must give  the  clerk  at  least  one  copy  of  each  amendment  for 
the defendants' use, and additional copies at the request of the clerk or a defendant.  A defendant may appear or answer in 
the  time  and  manner  and  with  the  same  effect  as  provided in Rule 71.1(e). 

( g)  Substituting parties.--If a defendant dies, becomes in-competent,  or  transfers  an  interest  after  being  joined,  the 
court  may,  on  motion  and  notice  of  hearing,  order  that  the proper  party  be  substituted.  Service  of  the  motion  and 
notice  on  a  nonparty  must  be  made  as  provided  in  Rule 71.1(d)(3). 

(h)  Trial of the issues. (

1)  Issues other than compensation; compensation.--In an action involving eminent domain under federal law, the 

court tries all issues, including compensation, except when compensation must be determined: 

(A)  by any tribunal specially  constituted by a federal statute to determine compensation; or 
(B)  if there is no such tribunal, by a jury when a party demands  one  within  the  time  to  answer  or  within  any 
additional time the court sets, unless the court appoints a commission. 

(2)  Appointing a commission; commission's powers 
and report. (A)  Reasons  for  appointing.--If  a  party  has  de-

manded  a  jury,  the  court  may  instead  appoint  a  three-person  commission  to  determine  compensation  because 
of the character, location, or quantity of the property to be condemned or for other just reasons.

1136  RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 

(B)  Alternate  commissioners.--The  court  may  ap-point up to two additional persons to serve as alternate 

commissioners  to  hear  the  case  and  replace  commis-sioners  who,  before  a  decision  is  filed,  the  court  finds 
unable  or  disqualified  to  perform  their  duties.  Once the  commission  renders  its  final  decision,  the  court 
must  discharge  any  alternate  who  has  not  replaced  a commissioner. 

(C)  Examining  the  prospective  commissioners.--Be-fore making its appointments, the court must advise the 
parties of the identity and qualifications of each prospec-tive  commissioner  and  alternate,  and  may  permit  the 
parties to examine them.  The parties may not suggest appointees,  but for good  cause may  object to a prospec-
tive commissioner or alternate. (

D)  Commission's powers and report.--A commission has the powers of a master under Rule 53(c).  Its action 

and  report  are  determined  by  a  majority.  Rule  53(d), (e), and (f) apply to its action and report. 

(i)  Dismissal of the action or a defendant. (1)  Dismissing the action. 

(A)  By  the  plaintiff.--If  no  compensation  hearing  on a  piece  of  property  has  begun,  and  if  the  plaintiff  has 
not  acquired  title  or  a  lesser  interest  or  taken  posses-sion, the plaintiff may, without a court order, dismiss the 
action as to that  property by filing a notice  of dismissal briefly describing the property. 

(B)  By  stipulation.--Before  a  judgment  is  entered vesting  the  plaintiff  with  title  or  a  lesser  interest  in  or 
possession of property, the plaintiff and affected defend-ants  may,  without  a  court  order,  dismiss  the  action  in 
whole  or  in  part  by  filing  a  stipulation  of  dismissal. And  if  the  parties  so  stipulate,  the  court  may  vacate  a 
judgment already entered. (

C)  By  court  order.--At  any  time  before  compensa-tion has been determined and paid, the court may, after 

a motion and hearing, dismiss the action as to a piece of property.  But  if  the  plaintiff  has  already  taken  title,  a

1137 RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 
lesser  interest,  or  possession  as  to  any  part  of  it,  the court  must  award  compensation  for  the  title,  lesser  in-

terest, or possession taken. 
(2)  Dismissing  a  defendant.--The  court  may  at  any 
time  dismiss  a  defendant  who  was  unnecessarily  or  im-properly joined. 

(3)  Effect.--A dismissal is without prejudice unless oth-erwise stated in the notice, stipulation, or court order. 

( j )  Deposit and its distribution. (

1)  Deposit.--The  plaintiff  must  deposit  with  the  court 
any  money  required  by  law  as  a  condition  to  the  exercise 
of eminent  domain  and may make a  deposit when  allowed 
by statute. 

(2)  Distribution;  adjusting  distribution.--After  a  de-
posit, the  court and  attorneys  must expedite  the  proceed-
ings  so  as  to  distribute  the  deposit  and  to  determine  and 
pay  compensation.  If  the  compensation  finally  awarded 
to a  defendant exceeds  the amount distributed to that  de-
fendant, the court must enter judgment against the plain-
tiff  for  the  deficiency.  If  the  compensation  awarded  to 
a  defendant  is  less  than  the  amount  distributed  to  that 
defendant,  the  court  must  enter  judgment  against  that 
defendant for the overpayment. 

(k)  Condemnation  under  a  state's  power  of  eminent  do-
main.--This  rule  governs  an  action  involving  eminent  do-
main  under  state  law.  But  if  state  law  provides  for  trying 
an issue by jury--or for trying the issue of compensation by 
jury or commission or both--that law governs. 

(l)  Costs.--Costs are not subject to Rule 54(d). 

Rule 72.  Magistrate judges: pretrial order. 

(a)  Nondispositive  matters.--When  a  pretrial  matter  not 
dispositive of a party's claim or defense is referred to a mag-
istrate  judge  to  hear  and  decide,  the  magistrate  judge  must 
promptly conduct the required proceedings and, when appro-
priate,  issue  a  written  order  stating  the  decision.  A  party 
may  serve  and  file  objections  to  the  order  within  10  days 

Date/Time: 05-12-10 16:26:21

1138  RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 
after  being  served with  a  copy.  A  party  may  not  assign  as 
error a defect  in the  order not timely  objected  to.  The dis-
trict  judge  in  the  case  must  consider  timely  objections  and 
modify or set aside any part of the order that is clearly erro-
neous or is contrary to law. 

(b)  Dispositive motions and prisoner petitions. 

(1)  Findings and recommendations.--A  magistrate 
judge  must  promptly  conduct  the  required  proceedings 
when assigned, without the parties' consent, to hear a pre-
trial matter dispositive of a claim or defense or a prisoner 
petition challenging the conditions of confinement.  A rec-
ord must be made of all evidentiary proceedings and may, 
at the magistrate judge's discretion, be made of any other 
proceedings.  The  magistrate  judge  must  enter  a  recom-
mended  disposition,  including,  if  appropriate,  proposed 
findings  of  fact.  The  clerk  must  promptly  mail  a  copy  to 
each party. 

(2)  Objections.--Within 10 days after being served with 
a copy of the recommended disposition, a party may serve 
and  file  specific  written  objections  to  the  proposed  find-
ings  and  recommendations.  A  party  may  respond  to  an-
other party's objections within 10 days after being served 
with  a  copy.  Unless  the  district  judge  orders  otherwise, 
the  objecting  party  must  promptly  arrange  for  transcrib-
ing the record, or whatever portions of it the parties agree 
to or the magistrate judge considers sufficient. 

(3)  Resolving  objections.--The  district  judge  must  de-
termine de novo any part of the magistrate judge's disposi-
tion  that  has  been  properly  objected  to.  The  district 
judge may accept, reject, or modify the recommended dis-
position; receive further evidence; or return the matter to 
the magistrate judge with instructions. 

Rule 73.  Magistrate judges: trial by consent; appeal. 

(a)  Trial  by consent.--When authorized under 28 U. S. C. 

$ 636(c),  a  magistrate  judge  may,  if  all  parties  consent,  con-
duct  a  civil  action  or  proceeding,  including  a  jury  or  non-

jury  trial.  A  record  must  be  made  in  accordance  with  28 U. S. C. $ 636(c)(5). 

(b)  Consent procedure. (

1)  In general.--When a magistrate judge has been des-
ignated  to  conduct  civil  actions  or  proceedings,  the  clerk must  give  the  parties  written  notice  of  their  opportunity 

to consent under 28 U. S. C. $ 636(c).  To signify their con-
sent, the parties must jointly or separately file a statement 
consenting to the referral.  A district judge or magistrate 
judge may be informed of a party's response to the clerk's 
notice only if all parties have consented to the referral. 

(2)  Reminding  the  parties  about  consenting.--A  dis-
trict  judge,  magistrate  judge,  or  other  court  official  may 
remind  the  parties  of  the  magistrate  judge's  availability, 
but  must  also  advise  them  that  they  are  free  to  withhold 
consent without adverse substantive consequences. 

(3)  Vacating  a  referral.--On  its  own  for  good  cause-- 
or  when  a  party  shows  extraordinary  circumstances--the 
district judge may vacate a referral to a magistrate judge 
under this rule. 

(c)  Appealing a judgment.--In accordance with 28 U. S. C. 

$ 636(c)(3),  an  appeal  from  a  judgment  entered  at  a  magis-
trate  judge's  direction  may  be  taken  to  the  court  of  appeals 
as  would  any  other  appeal  from  a  district-court  judgment.

(b)  Place for trial and other proceedings.--Every trial on 
the  merits  must  be  conducted  in  open  court  and,  so  far  as 
convenient,  in  a  regular  courtroom.  Any  other  act  or  pro-
ceeding  may  be  done  or  conducted  by  a  judge  in  chambers,

(A)  is  not  specified  in  a  federal  statute,  the  Rules 
Governing  Section  2254  Cases,  or  the  Rules  Governing 
Section 2255 Cases; and

States officer or agency under a federal statute, except as 
otherwise  provided  by  statute,  by  local  rule,  or  by  court 
order in the proceedings. 

(6)  Other proceedings.--These rules, to the extent appli-
cable, govern proceedings under the following laws, except 
as these laws provide other procedures: 

(A)  7  U. S. C.  $$ 292,  499g(c),  for  reviewing  an  order

1144  RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 

(c)  Removed actions. 

(1)  Applicability.--These  rules  apply  to  a  civil  action 
after it is removed from a state court. 

(2)  Further pleading.--After removal, repleading is un-
necessary  unless  the  court  orders  it.  A  defendant  who 
did  not  answer  before  removal  must  answer  or  present 
other  defenses  or  objections  under  these  rules  within  the 
longest of these periods: 

(A)  20  days  after  receiving--through  service  or  oth-
erwise--a  copy  of  the  initial  pleading  stating  the  claim 
for relief; 

(B)  20  days  after being  served  with  the  summons for 
an initial pleading on file at the time of service; or 

(C)  5 days after the notice of removal is filed. 

(3)  Demand for a jury trial. 

(A)  As  affected  by  state  law.--A  party  who,  before 
removal,  expressly  demanded  a  jury  trial  in  accordance 
with  state  law  need  not  renew  the  demand  after  re-
moval.  If  the  state  law  did  not  require  an  express  de-
mand  for  a  jury  trial,  a  party  need  not  make  one  after 
removal  unless  the  court  orders  the  parties  to  do  so 
within  a  specified  time.  The  court  must  so  order  at  a 
party's  request  and  may  so  order  on  its  own.  A  party 
who  fails  to  make  a  demand  when  so  ordered  waives  a 
jury trial. 

(B)  Under  Rule  38.--If  all  necessary  pleadings  have 
been  served  at  the  time  of  removal,  a  party  entitled  to 
a jury trial under Rule 38 must be given one if the party 
serves a demand within 10 days after: 

(i)  it files a notice of removal; or 
(ii)  it  is  served  with  a  notice  of  removal  filed  by 
another party. 

(d)  Law applicable. 

(1)  State law.--When these rules refer to state law, the 
term "law" includes the state's statutes and the state's ju-
dicial decisions.

1145 RULES  OF  CIVIL  PROCEDURE 
(2)  District  of  Columbia.--The  term  "state"  includes, where appropriate, the District of Columbia.  When these 

rules  provide  for  state  law  to  apply,  in  the  District  Court for the District of Columbia: 

(A)  the law applied in the District governs; and (B)  the  term  "federal  statute"  includes  any  Act  of 
Congress that applies locally to the District. 
Rule 82.  Jurisdiction and venue unaffected. 

These  rules  do  not  extend  or  limit  the  jurisdiction  of  the district  courts  or  the  venue  of  actions  in  those  courts.  An 

admiralty  or  maritime  claim  under  Rule  9(h)  is  not  a  civil action for purposes of 28 U. S. C. $$ 1391-1392. 

Rule 83.  Rules by district courts; judge's directives. 

(a)  Local rules. (1)  In  general.--After  giving  public  notice  and  an  op-

portunity  for  comment,  a  district  court,  acting  by  a  ma-jority  of  its  district  judges,  may  adopt  and  amend  rules 
governing  its  practice.  A  local  rule  must  be  consistent 
with--but not duplicate--federal  statutes and rules adopted under  28  U. S. C.  $$ 2072  and 2075,  and must con-

form to any uniform numbering  system prescribed by  the Judicial  Conference  of  the  United  States.  A  local  rule 
takes effect on the date specified by the district court and remains  in  effect  unless  amended  by  the  court  or  abro-
gated by the judicial council of the circuit.  Copies of rules and  amendments  must,  on  their  adoption,  be  furnished  to 
the  judicial  council  and  the  Administrative  Office  of  the United States Courts and be made available to the public. 

(2)  Requirement  of  form.--A  local  rule  imposing  a  re-quirement  of  form  must  not  be  enforced  in  a  way  that 
causes  a  party  to  lose  any  right  because  of  a  nonwillful 
failure to comply. 

(b)  Procedure when there is no controlling law.--A judge may regulate practice in any manner consistent with federal 

law, rules adopted under 28 U. S. C. $$ 2072 and 2075, and the

district's  local  rules.  No  sanction  or  other  disadvantage may be imposed for noncompliance with any requirement not 

in  federal  law,  federal  rules,  or  the  local  rules  unless  the alleged  violator  has  been  furnished  in  the  particular  case 
with actual notice of the requirement. 
Rule 84.  Forms. 

The  forms  in  the  Appendix  suffice  under  these  rules and  illustrate  the  simplicity  and  brevity  that  these  rules 

contemplate. 
Rule 85.  Title. 

These  rules  may  be  cited  as  the  Federal  Rules  of  Civil Procedure. 

Rule 86.  Effective dates. 

(a)  In general.--These rules and any amendments take ef-fect  at  the  time  specified  by  the  Supreme  Court,  subject  to 

28 U. S. C. $ 2074.  They govern: (1)  proceedings  in  an  action  commenced  after  their  ef-

fective date; and (2)  proceedings  after  that  date  in  an  action  then  pend-
ing unless: (A)  the Supreme Court specifies otherwise; or 

(B)  the court determines that applying them in a par-ticular  action  would  be  infeasible  or  work  an  injustice. 

(b)  December  1,  2007  amendments.--If  any  provision  in Rules 1-5.1, 6-73, or 77-86 conflicts with another law, prior-
ity  in  time  for  the  purpose  of  28  U. S. C.  $ 2072(b)  is  not  af-fected by the amendments taking effect on December 1, 2007.
