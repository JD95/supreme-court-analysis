CASES ADJUDGED

IN THE

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

AT
OCTOBER TERM, 1997

UNITED STATES v. CABRALES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eighth circuit

No. 97-643. Argued April 29, 1998--Decided June 1, 1998
An indictment returned in the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri charged respondent Cabrales, as sole defendant, with conspiracy under 18 U. S. C. $ 371 to violate $ 1956(a)(1)(B)(ii)
(conducting a financial transaction to avoid a transaction-reporting requirement) (Count I), and with money laundering in violation of the
latter section (Count II) and $ 1957 (engaging in a monetary transaction in criminally derived property of a value greater than $10,000)
(Count III). The indictment alleged that, in January 1991, Cabrales
deposited $40,000 with the AmSouth Bank of Florida and, within a
week, made four separate $9,500 withdrawals from that bank. The
money deposited and withdrawn was traceable to illegal cocaine sales
in Missouri. Cabrales moved to dismiss the indictment in its entirety
for improper venue. The District Court denied the motion as to Count
I, the conspiracy count, but dismissed Counts II and III, the moneylaundering counts, because the money-laundering activity occurred entirely in Florida. In affirming that dismissal, the Eighth Circuit noted
that the Constitution, Art. III, $ 2, cl. 3, and Amdt. 6, as well as Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 18, requires that a person be tried
where the charged offense was committed. While recognizing that a
continuing offense "begun in one district and completed in another . . .
may be . . . prosecuted in any district in which such offense was begun,
continued, or completed," 18 U. S. C. $ 3237(a), the court said that Cabrales was not accused of a continuing offense, but was charged with

1

2 UNITED STATES v. CABRALES

Syllabus
money-laundering transactions that began, continued, and were completed only in Florida. It was of no moment that the money came from
Missouri, the court explained, because Cabrales dealt with it only in
Florida, the money-laundering counts alleged no act committed by Cabrales in Missouri, and the Government did not assert that Cabrales
transported the money from Missouri to Florida.

Held: Missouri is not a place of proper venue for the money-laundering

offenses with which Cabrales is charged. The locus delicti must be
determined from the nature of the crime alleged and the location of
the act or acts constituting it. United States v. Anderson, 328 U. S.
699, 703. Here, the crimes charged in Counts II and III are defined in
statutory proscriptions, $$ 1956(a)(1)(B)(ii) and 1957, that interdict only
the financial transactions (acts located entirely in Florida), not the anterior criminal conduct that yielded the funds allegedly laundered. Contrary to the Government's contention, the crimes charged in those
counts do not fit under $ 3237(a) as offenses begun in Missouri and completed in Florida, but are crimes that took place wholly within Florida.
Notably, the counts at issue do not charge Cabrales with conspiracy;
they do not link her to, or assert her responsibility for, acts done by
others. Nor do they charge her as an aider or abettor, punishable as a
principal, in the Missouri drug trafficking, see 18 U. S. C. $ 2. Rather,
those counts charge her with criminal activity "after the fact" of an
offense begun and completed by others. Cf. $ 3. Whenever a defendant acts "after the fact" to conceal a crime, it might be said, as the
Government urges, that the first crime is an essential element of the
second, and that the second facilitated the first or made it profitable by
impeding its detection. But the question here is the place appropriate
to try the "after the fact" actor. It is immaterial whether that actor
knew where the first crime was committed. The money launderer must
know she is dealing with funds derived from specified unlawful activity,
here, drug trafficking, but the Missouri venue of that activity is, as the
Eighth Circuit said, of no moment. Money laundering arguably might
rank as a continuing offense, triable in more than one place, if the launderer acquired the funds in one district and transported them into another, but that is tellingly not this case. Neither Hyde v. United States,
225 U. S. 347, nor In re Palliser, 136 U. S. 257, supports the Government's position that money launderers can in all cases be prosecuted at
the place where the funds they handled were generated. Hyde involved
a conspiracy prosecution in which the Court held venue proper in the
District of Columbia based on overt acts committed by a co-conspirator
in the District. Palliser concerned a prosecution for mailings from
New York to Connecticut in which the Court held Connecticut venue

Opinion of the Court
proper because the mailings were completed in that State. By contrast,
the counts here at issue allege no conspiracy, but describe activity in
which Cabrales alone engaged. Nor do they charge that she dispatched
any missive from one State into another; instead, they portray her and
the money she deposited and withdrew as moving inside Florida only.
Finally, the Court rejects the Government's contention that efficiency
warrants trying Cabrales in Missouri because evidence there, and not
in Florida, shows that the money she allegedly laundered derived from
unlawful activity. The Government is not disarmed from showing that
Cabrales is in fact linked to the drug trafficking. She can be, and indeed has been, charged with conspiring with the drug dealers in Missouri. If the Government can prove the agreement it has alleged in
Count I, Cabrales can be prosecuted in Missouri for that confederacy,
and her Florida money laundering could be shown as overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy. See $ 371. As the Government acknowledged, the difference in her sentence probably would be negligible.

4 UNITED STATES v. CABRALES

Opinion of the Court
from the unlawful distribution of cocaine in Missouri. Thedefendant, respondent Vickie S. Cabrales, is not alleged to

have transported funds from Missouri to Florida. Nor is shecharged, in the counts before us, with participation in the
Missouri cocaine distribution that generated the funds inquestion. In accord with the Court of Appeals for the
Eighth Circuit, we hold that Missouri is not a proper placefor trial of the money-laundering offenses at issue.

I
In a three-count indictment returned in the United StatesDistrict Court for the Western District of Missouri, Cabrales, as sole defendant, was charged with the following of-fenses: conspiracy to avoid a transaction-reporting requirement, in violation of 18 U. S. C. $$ 371, 1956(a)(1)(B)(ii)(Count I); conducting a financial transaction to avoid a
transaction-reporting requirement, in violation of $ 1956(a)(1)(B)(ii) (Count II); and engaging in a monetary transaction in criminally derived property of a value greater than$10,000, in violation of $ 1957 (Count III). The indictment
alleged that, in January 1991, Cabrales deposited $40,000with the AmSouth Bank of Florida and, within a week's
span, made four separate withdrawals of $9,500 each fromthat bank. The money deposited and withdrawn was traceable to illegal sales of cocaine in Missouri.Cabrales moved to dismiss the indictment in its entirety
for improper venue. On recommendation of the Magistrate,the District Court denied the motion as to Count I, the conspiracy count, based on the Government's assertions that Ca-brales "was present in Missouri during the conspiracy, lived
with a conspirator in Missouri, and participated in variousactivities in Missouri in furtherance of the conspiracy."
App. to Pet. for Cert. 11a, 14a-15a. Also on the Magistrate'srecommendation, the District Court granted the motion to
dismiss Counts II and III, the money-laundering counts, be-cause the deposit and withdrawals occurred in Florida and

Opinion of the Court
"[n]o activity of money laundering . . . occurred in Missouri."
Id., at 11a, 14a.

On the Government's appeal, the Eighth Circuit affirmedthe District Court's dismissal of the money-laundering

counts. 109 F. 3d 471, as amended, 115 F. 3d 621 (CA8 1997).
The conspiracy charge was not part of the appeal, and thatcount remains pending in the Missouri District Court. 109

F. 3d, at 472, n. 2, as amended, 115 F. 3d 621.The Court of Appeals first recounted law that is not in
doubt: "Both Rule 18 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Proce-dure and the Constitution require that a person be tried for
an offense where that offense is committed," 109 F. 3d, at
472; also, the site of a charged offense " `must be determined
from the nature of the crime alleged and the location of the
act or acts constituting it,' " ibid. (quoting United States v.
Anderson, 328 U. S. 699, 703 (1946)). "Continuing offenses,"
the Court of Appeals recognized, those "begun in one district
and completed in another," 18 U. S. C. $ 3237(a), may be tried
" `in any district in which such [an] offense was begun, continued, or completed.' " 109 F. 3d, at 472 (quoting $ 3237(a)).

But "Cabrales was not accused of a `continuing offense,' "
the Eighth Circuit said, ibid.; "[s]he was charged with money
laundering, for transactions which began, continued, and
were completed only in Florida," ibid. "That the money
came from Missouri is of no moment," the Court of Appeals
next observed, for "Cabrales dealt with it only in Florida."
Ibid. The money-laundering counts "include[d] no act committed by Cabrales in Missouri," the Eighth Circuit emphasized, nor did "the [G]overnment charge that Cabrales transported the money from Missouri to Florida." Ibid.

The Government urges that, in conflict with the Eighth
Circuit, other Courts of Appeals "have held that venue for
money laundering offenses is proper in the district in which
the funds were unlawfully generated, even if the financial
transaction that constitutes the laundering occurred wholly
within another district." Pet. for Cert. 9-10 (citing United

Opinion of the Court
States v. Heaps, 39 F. 3d 479, 482 (CA4 1994); United Statesv. Beddow, 957 F. 2d 1330, 1335-1336 (CA6 1992); United

States v. Sax, 39 F. 3d 1380, 1390-1391 (CA7 1994); UnitedStates v. Angotti, 105 F. 3d 539, 544-545 (CA9 1997)). We
granted certiorari to resolve the conflict, 522 U. S. 1072(1998), and now affirm the Eighth Circuit's judgment.

II
Proper venue in criminal proceedings was a matter of con-cern to the Nation's founders. Their complaints against the

King of Great Britain, listed in the Declaration of Inde-pendence, included his transportation of colonists "beyond
Seas to be tried." 1 The Constitution twice safeguards thedefendant's venue right: Article III, $ 2, cl. 3, instructs that
"Trial of all Crimes . . . shall be held in the State wherethe said Crimes shall have been committed"; the Sixth
Amendment calls for trial "by an impartial jury of theState and district wherein the crime shall have been committed." Rule 18 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Pro-cedure, providing that "prosecution shall be had in a district
in which the offense was committed," echoes the constitu-tional commands.

We adhere to the general guide invoked and applied bythe Eighth Circuit: "[T]he locus delicti must be determined

1 The Declaration recited among injuries and usurpations attributed
to the King: "transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended
offences." The Declaration of Independence, para. 21 (1776). A complaint of the same tenor appeared earlier, in the 1769 "Virginia Resolves."
See Blume, The Place of Trial of Criminal Cases: Constitutional Vicinage
and Venue, 43 Mich. L. Rev. 59, 64 (1944). Parliament had decreed that
colonists charged with treason could be tried in England. See 16 Parliamentary History of England from the Earliest Period to Year 1803,
pp. 476-510 (T. Hansard ed. 1813). In response, the Virginia House of
Burgesses unanimously passed a resolution condemning the practice of
sending individuals "beyond the Sea, to be tried" as "highly derogatory
of the Rights of British subjects." Journals of the House of Burgesses of
Virginia, 1766-1769, p. 214 (J. Kennedy ed. 1906).

from the nature of the crime alleged and the location of theact or acts constituting it."

Anderson, 328 U. S., at 703.
Here, the crimes described in Counts II and III are definedin statutory proscriptions, 18 U. S. C. $$ 1956(a)(1)(B)(ii),

1957, that interdict only the financial transactions (acts located entirely in Florida), not the anterior criminal conductthat yielded the funds allegedly laundered.

Congress has provided by statute for offenses "begun inone district and completed in another"; such offenses may be
"prosecuted in any district in which [the] offense was begun,continued, or completed." 18 U. S. C. $ 3237(a). The Government urges that the money-laundering crimes described
in Counts II and III of the indictment against Cabrales fit
the $ 3237(a) description. We therefore confront and decide
this question: Do those counts charge crimes begun in Missouri and completed in Florida, rendering venue proper in
Missouri, or do they delineate crimes that took place wholly
within Florida?

Notably, the counts at issue do not charge Cabrales with
conspiracy; they do not link her to, or assert her responsibility for, acts done by others. Nor do they charge her as an
aider or abettor in the Missouri drug trafficking. See 18
U. S. C. $ 2 (one who aids or abets an offense "is punishable as
a principal"). Cabrales is charged in the money-laundering
counts with criminal activity "after the fact" of an offense
begun and completed by others. Cf. $ 3 ("Whoever, knowing
that an offense against the United States has been committed, . . . assists the offender in order to hinder or prevent
his . . . punishment, is an accessory after the fact," punishable
not as a principal, but by a term of imprisonment or fine
generally "not more than one-half the maximum . . . prescribed for the punishment of the principal[.]").

Whenever a defendant acts "after the fact" to conceal a
crime, it might be said, as the Government urges in this
case, that the first crime is an essential element of the
second, see Brief for United States 9, and that the second

8 UNITED STATES v. CABRALES

Opinion of the Court
facilitated the first or made it profitable by impeding its detection, see id., at 14. But the question here is the place
appropriate to try the "after the fact" actor. As the Government recognizes, it is immaterial whether that actor
knew where the first crime was committed. See Tr. of Oral
Arg. 5-6. The money launderer must know she is dealing
with funds derived from "specified unlawful activity," here,
drug trafficking, but the Missouri venue of that activity is, as
the Eighth Circuit said, "of no moment." 109 F. 3d, at 472.2

Money laundering, the Court of Appeals acknowledged,
arguably might rank as a "continuing offense," triable in
more than one place, if the launderer acquired the funds in
one district and transported them into another. Id., at 473.
But that is tellingly not this case. In the counts at issue,
the Government indicted Cabrales "for transactions which
began, continued, and were completed only in Florida." Id.,
at 472. Under these circumstances, venue in Missouri is
improper.

The Government identified Hyde v. United States, 225
U. S. 347 (1912), and In re Palliser, 136 U. S. 257 (1890), as
the two best cases for its position that money launderers can
in all cases be prosecuted at the place where the funds they
handled were generated. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 6. Neither
decision warrants the ruling the Government here seeks.

In Hyde, the defendants were convicted in the District
of Columbia of conspiracy to defraud the United States.
Although none of the defendants had entered the District as
part of the conspiracy, venue was nevertheless appropriate,
the Court ruled, based on the overt acts of a co-conspirator
there. 225 U. S., at 363. By contrast, the counts at issue
in this case allege no conspiracy. They describe activity in
which Cabrales alone, untied to others, engaged.

2 Cf. United States v. Lanoue, 137 F. 3d 656, 661 (CA1 1998) (stating that
crime of being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U. S. C.

$ 922(g)(1), occurs only where the firearm is actually possessed).

Opinion of the Court
In re Palliser concerned a man who sent letters from NewYork to postmasters in Connecticut, attempting to gain postage on credit, in violation of then-applicable law. The Courtheld that the defendant could be prosecuted in Connecticut,
where the mail he addressed and dispatched was received.
136 U. S., at 266-268. The Palliser opinion simply recog-nizes that a mailing to Connecticut is properly ranked as an

act completed in that State. Cf. 18 U. S. C. $ 3237(a) ("Anyoffense involving the use of the mails . . . is a continuing
offense and . . . may be . . . prosecuted in any district from,through, or into which such . . . mail matter . . . moves.");
United States v. Johnson, 323 U. S. 273, 275 (1944) (consistent
with the Constitution "an illegal use of the mails . . . may

the goods, or in the district of their arrival, or in any intervening district"). Cabrales, however, dispatched no missive
from one State into another. The counts before us portray
her and the money she deposited and withdrew as moving
inside Florida only.

Finally, the Government urges the efficiency of trying
Cabrales in Missouri, because evidence in that State, and not
in Florida, shows that the money Cabrales allegedly laundered derived from unlawful activity. Although recognizing
that the venue requirement is principally a protection for the
defendant, Reply Brief 10, the Government further maintains that its convenience, and the interests of the community victimized by drug dealers, merit consideration.

But if Cabrales is in fact linked to the drug-trafficking
activity, the Government is not disarmed from showing that
is the case. She can be, and indeed has been, charged with
conspiring with the drug dealers in Missouri. If the Government can prove the agreement it has alleged, Cabrales
can be prosecuted in Missouri for that confederacy, and her
money laundering in Florida could be shown as overt acts in
furtherance of the conspiracy. See 18 U. S. C. $ 371 (requiring proof of an "act to effect the object of the conspiracy").

FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION v. AKINS et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe district of columbia circuit

No. 96-1590. Argued January 14, 1998--Decided June 1, 1998
The Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA) seeks to remedy

corruption of the political process. As relevant here, it imposes extensive recordkeeping and disclosure requirements upon "political committee[s]," which include "any committee, club, association or other group
of persons which receives" more than $1,000 in "contributions" or "which
makes" more than $1,000 in "expenditures" in any given year, 2 U. S. C.

$ 431(4)(A) (emphasis added), "for the purpose of influencing any election
for Federal office," $$ 431(8)(A)(i), (9)(A)(i). Assistance given to help a
particular candidate will not count toward the $1,000 "expenditure" ceiling if it takes the form of a "communication" by a "membership organization or corporation" "to its members"--as long as the organization is
not "organized primarily for the purpose of influencing [any individual's]
nomination . . . or election." $ 431(9)(B)(iii). Respondents, voters with
views often opposed to those of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), filed a compliant with petitioner Federal Election Commission (FEC), asking the FEC to find that AIPAC had violated FECA
and, among other things, to order AIPAC to make public the information
that FECA demands of political committees. In dismissing the complaint, the FEC found that AIPAC's communications fell outside FECA's
membership communications exception. Nonetheless, it concluded,
AIPAC was not a "political committee" because, as an issue-oriented
lobbying organization, its major purpose was not the nomination or
election of candidates. The District Court granted the FEC summary
judgment when it reviewed the determination, but the en banc Court
of Appeals reversed on the ground that the FEC's major purpose test
improperly interpreted FECA's definition of a political committee. The
case presents this Court with two questions: (1) whether respondents
had standing to challenge the FEC's decision, and (2) whether an organization falls outside FECA's definition of a "political committee" because
"its major purpose" is not "the nomination or election of candidates."

Held:

1. Respondents, as voters seeking information to which they believe
FECA entitles them, have standing to challenge the FEC's decision not
to bring an enforcement action. Pp. 19-26.

Syllabus
(a) Respondents satisfy prudential standing requirements. FECA
specifically provides that "[a]ny person" who believes FECA has been
violated may file a complaint with the FEC, $ 437g(a)(1), and that "[a]ny
party aggrieved" by an FEC order dismissing such party's complaint
may seek district court review of the dismissal, $ 437g(a)(8)(A). History associates the word "aggrieved" with a congressional intent to cast
the standing net broadly--beyond the common-law interests and substantive statutory rights upon which "prudential" standing traditionally rested. E. g., FCC v. Sanders Brothers Radio Station, 309 U. S.
470. Moreover, respondents' asserted injury--their failure to obtain
relevant information--is injury of a kind that FECA seeks to address.
Pp. 19-20.

(b) Respondents also satisfy constitutional standing requirements.
Their inability to obtain information that, they claim, FECA requires
AIPAC to make public meets the genuine "injury in fact" requirement
that helps assure that the court will adjudicate "[a] concrete, living
contest between adversaries." Coleman v. Miller, 307 U. S. 433, 460
(Frankfurter, J., dissenting). United States v. Richardson, 418 U. S.
166, distinguished. The fact that the harm at issue is widely shared
does not deprive Congress of constitutional power to authorize its vindication in the federal courts where the harm is concrete. See Public
Citizen v. Department of Justice, 491 U. S. 440, 449-450. The informational injury here, directly related to voting, the most basic of political
rights, is sufficiently concrete. Respondents have also satisfied the remaining two constitutional standing requirements: The harm asserted
is "fairly traceable" to the FEC's decision not to issue its complaint, and
the courts in this case can "redress" that injury. Pp. 20-25.

(c) Finally, FECA explicitly indicates a congressional intent to alter
the traditional view that agency enforcement decisions are not subject to judicial review. Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U. S. 821, 832, distinguished. P. 26.

2. Because of the unusual and complex circumstances in which the
case arises, the second question presented cannot be addressed here,
and the case must be remanded. After the FEC determined that many
persons belonging to AIPAC were not "members" under FEC regulations, the Court of Appeals overturned those regulations in another
case, in part because it thought they defined membership organizations
too narrowly in light of an organization's First Amendment right to
communicate with its members. The FEC's new "membership organization" rules could significantly affect the interpretative issue presented
by Question Two. Thus, the FEC should proceed to determine whether
or not AIPAC's expenditures qualify as "membership communications"
under the new rules, and thereby fall outside the scope of "expendi524US1 Unit: $U72 [09-06-00 17:28:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN

tures" that could qualify it as a "political committee." If it decides that
the communications here do not qualify, then the lower courts can still
evaluate the significance of the communicative context in which the case
arises. If, on the other hand, it decides that they do qualify, the matter
will become moot. Pp. 26-29.

Opinion of the Court
Commission's determination in court, and we remand thiscase for further proceedings.

I
In light of our disposition of this case, we believe it neces-sary to describe its procedural background in some detail.

As commonly understood, the FECA seeks to remedy anyactual or perceived corruption of the political process in several important ways. The Act imposes limits upon theamounts that individuals, corporations, "political committees" (including political action committees), and politicalparties can contribute to a candidate for federal political office. $$ 441a(a), 441a(b), 441b. The Act also imposes limitson the amount these individuals or entities can spend in coordination with a candidate. (It treats these expendituresas "contributions to" a candidate for purposes of the Act.)

$ 441a(a)(7)(B)(i). As originally written, the Act set limitsupon the total amount that a candidate could spend of his
own money, and upon the amounts that other individuals,corporations, and "political committees" could spend independent of a candidate--though the Court found that cer-tain of these last-mentioned limitations violated the First
Amendment. Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 39-59 (1976)
(per curiam); Federal Election Comm'n v. National Con-servative Political Action Comm., 470 U. S. 480, 497 (1985);

cf. Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm. v. Fed-eral Election Comm'n, 518 U. S. 604, 613-619 (1996) (opinion
of Breyer, J.).This case concerns requirements in the Act that extend
beyond these better-known contribution and expenditurelimitations. In particular, the Act imposes extensive recordkeeping and disclosure requirements upon groups thatfall within the Act's definition of a "political committee."
Those groups must register with the FEC, appoint a treas-urer, keep names and addresses of contributors, track the
amount and purpose of disbursements, and file complex FEC

Opinion of the Court
reports that include lists of donors giving in excess of $200per year (often, these donors may be the group's members),

contributions, expenditures, and any other disbursementsirrespective of their purposes. $$ 432-434.

The Act's use of the word "political committee" calls to
mind the term "political action committee," or "PAC," a termthat normally refers to organizations that corporations or

trade unions might establish for the purpose of making con-tributions or expenditures that the Act would otherwise prohibit. See $$ 431(4)(B), 441b. But, in fact, the Act's term"political committee" has a much broader scope. The Act
states that a "political committee" includes "any committee,
club, association or other group of persons which receives"
more than $1,000 in "contributions" or "which makes" more
than $1,000 in "expenditures" in any given year. $ 431(4)(A)
(emphasis added).

This broad definition, however, is less universally encompassing than at first it may seem, for later definitional
subsections limit its scope. The Act defines the key terms
"contribution" and "expenditure" as covering only those
contributions and expenditures that are made "for the
purpose of influencing any election for Federal office."

$$ 431(8)(A)(i), (9)(A)(i). Moreover, the Act sets forth detailed categories of disbursements, loans, and assistancein-kind that do not count as a "contribution" or an "expenditure," even when made for election-related purposes.

$$ 431(8)(B), (9)(B). In particular, assistance given to help a
candidate will not count toward the $1,000 "expenditure"
ceiling that qualifies an organization as a "political committee" if it takes the form of a "communication" by an organization "to its members"--as long as the organization at issue
is a "membership organization or corporation" and it is not
"organized primarily for the purpose of influencing the nomination . . . or electio[n] of any individual." $ 431(9)(B)(iii).

This case arises out of an effort by respondents, a group
of voters with views often opposed to those of AIPAC, to

16 FEDERAL ELECTION COMM'N v. AKINS

Opinion of the Court
persuade the FEC to treat AIPAC as a "political committee."
Respondents filed a complaint with the FEC, stating that
AIPAC had made more than $1,000 in qualifying "expenditures" per year, and thereby became a "political committee."
1 Record, Exh. B, p. 4. They added that AIPAC had violated the FEC provisions requiring "political committee[s]"
to register and to make public the information about members, contributions, and expenditures to which we have just
referred. Id., at 2, 9-17. Respondents also claimed that
AIPAC had violated $ 441b of FECA, which prohibits corporate campaign "contribution[s]" and "expenditure[s]." Id.,
at 2, 16-17. They asked the FEC to find that AIPAC had
violated the Act, and, among other things, to order AIPAC
to make public the information that FECA demands of a "political committee." Id., at 33-34.

AIPAC asked the FEC to dismiss the complaint. AIPAC
described itself as an issue-oriented organization that seeks
to maintain friendship and promote goodwill between the
United States and Israel. App. 120; see also Brief for
AIPAC as Amicus Curiae (AIPAC Brief) 1, 3. AIPAC conceded that it lobbies elected officials and disseminates information about candidates for public office. App. 43, 120; see
also AIPAC Brief 6. But in responding to the $ 441b charge,
AIPAC denied that it had made the kinds of "expenditures"
that matter for FECA purposes (i. e., the kinds of electionrelated expenditures that corporations cannot make, and
which count as the kind of expenditures that, when they
exceed $1,000, qualify a group as a "political committee").

To put the matter more specifically: AIPAC focused on certain "expenditures" that respondents had claimed were election related, such as the costs of meetings with candidates,
the introduction of AIPAC members to candidates, and the
distribution of candidate position papers. AIPAC said that
its spending on such activities, even if election related, fell
within a relevant exception. They amounted, said AIPAC,

524US1 Unit: $U72 [09-06-00 17:28:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN

17Cite as: 524 U. S. 11 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
to communications by a membership organization with its
members, App. 164-166, which the Act exempts from its
definition of "expenditures," $ 431(9)(B)(iii). In AIPAC's
view, these communications therefore did not violate $ 441b's
corporate expenditure prohibition. 2 Record, Doc. No. 19,
pp. 2-6. (And, if AIPAC was right, those expenditures
would not count toward the $1,000 ceiling on "expenditures"
that might transform an ordinary issue-related group into a
"political committee." $ 431(4).)

The FEC's General Counsel concluded that, between 1983
and 1988, AIPAC had indeed funded communications of the
sort described. The General Counsel said that those expenditures were campaign related, in that they amounted to
advocating the election or defeat of particular candidates.
App. 106-108. He added that these expenditures were
"likely to have crossed the $1,000 threshold." Id., at 146.
At the same time, the FEC closed the door to AIPAC's invocation of the "communications" exception. The FEC said
that, although it was a "close question," these expenditures
were not membership communications, because that exception applies to a membership organization's communications
with its members, and most of the persons who belonged to
AIPAC did not qualify as "members" for purposes of the Act.
App. to Pet. for Cert. 97a-98a; see also App. 170-173. Still,
given the closeness of the issue, the FEC exercised its discretion and decided not to proceed further with respect to
the claimed "corporate contribution" violation. App. to Pet.
for Cert. 98a.

The FEC's determination that many of the persons who
belonged to AIPAC were not "members" effectively foreclosed any claim that AIPAC's communications did not count
as "expenditures" for purposes of determining whether

it was a "political committee." Since AIPAC's activities
fell outside the "membership communications" exception,
AIPAC could not invoke that exception as a way of escaping

18 FEDERAL ELECTION COMM'N v. AKINS

Opinion of the Court
the scope of the Act's term "political committee" and theAct's disclosure provisions, which that definition triggers.

The FEC nonetheless held that AIPAC was not subjectto the disclosure requirements, but for a different reason.
In the FEC's view, the Act's definition of "political com-mittee" includes only those organizations that have as a
"major purpose" the nomination or election of candidates.Cf.

Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S., at 79. AIPAC, it added,was fundamentally an issue-oriented lobbying organization,

not a campaign-related organization, and hence AIPAC felloutside the definition of a "political committee" regardless.
App. 146. The FEC consequently dismissed respondents'complaint.

Respondents filed a petition in Federal District Courtseeking review of the FEC's determination dismissing their
complaint. See $$ 437g(a)(8)(A), 437g(a)(8)(C). The District Court granted summary judgment for the FEC, and adivided panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed. 66 F. 3d

348 (CADC 1995). The en banc Court of Appeals reversed,
however, on the ground that the FEC's "major purpose" testimproperly interpreted the Act's definition of a "political

committee." 101 F. 3d 731 (CADC 1997). We granted theFEC's petition for certiorari, which contained the following
two questions:

"1. Whether respondents had standing to challenge the
Federal Election Commission's decision not to bring anenforcement action in this case.

"2. Whether an organization that spends more than$1,000 on contributions or coordinated expenditures in a
calendar year, but is neither controlled by a candidatenor has its major purpose the nomination or election of
candidates, is a `political committee' within the meaningof the [Act]." Brief for Petitioner I.

We shall answer the first of these questions, but not thesecond.

Opinion of the Court

II
The Solicitor General argues that respondents lack stand-ing to challenge the FEC's decision not to proceed against

AIPAC. He claims that they have failed to satisfy the "pru-dential" standing requirements upon which this Court has
insisted. See, e. g., National Credit Union Admin. v. First
Nat. Bank & Trust Co., 522 U. S. 479, 488 (1998) (NCUA);Association of Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc.

v. Camp, 397 U. S. 150, 153 (1970) (Data Processing). Headds that respondents have not shown that they "suffe[r] injury in fact," that their injury is "fairly traceable" to theFEC's decision, or that a judicial decision in their favor
would "redres[s]" the injury. E. g., Bennett v. Spear, 520U. S. 154, 162 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted);
Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 560-561 (1992).In his view, respondents' District Court petition consequently failed to meet Article III's demand for a "case" or"controversy."

We do not agree with the FEC's "prudential standing"claim. Congress has specifically provided in FECA that
"[a]ny person who believes a violation of this Act . . . hasoccurred, may file a complaint with the Commission."

$ 437g(a)(1). It has added that "[a]ny party aggrieved by anorder of the Commission dismissing a complaint filed by such
party . . . may file a petition" in district court seeking reviewof that dismissal. $ 437g(a)(8)(A). History associates the
word "aggrieved" with a congressional intent to cast thestanding net broadly--beyond the common-law interests and
substantive statutory rights upon which "prudential" stand-ing traditionally rested.

fering legal wrong" or "adversely affected or aggrieved . . .within the meaning of a relevant statute" may seek judicial

review of agency action).Moreover, prudential standing is satisfied when the injury
asserted by a plaintiff " `arguably [falls] within the zone of
interests to be protected or regulated by the statute . . . inquestion.' "

NCUA, supra, at 488 (quoting Data Processing,
supra, at 153). The injury of which respondents complain--their failure to obtain relevant information--is injury of a

kind that FECA seeks to address. Buckley, supra, at 66-67 ("political committees" must disclose contributors and
disbursements to help voters understand who provides
which candidates with financial support). We have found
nothing in the Act that suggests Congress intended to exclude voters from the benefits of these provisions, or otherwise to restrict standing, say, to political parties, candidates,
or their committees.

Given the language of the statute and the nature of the
injury, we conclude that Congress, intending to protect voters such as respondents from suffering the kind of injury
here at issue, intended to authorize this kind of suit. Consequently, respondents satisfy "prudential" standing requirements. Cf. Raines v. Byrd, 521 U. S. 811, 820, n. 3 (1997)
(explicit grant of authority to bring suit "eliminates any prudential standing limitations and significantly lessens the risk
of unwanted conflict with the Legislative Branch").

Nor do we agree with the FEC or the dissent that Congress lacks the constitutional power to authorize federal
courts to adjudicate this lawsuit. Article III, of course, limits Congress' grant of judicial power to "cases" or "controversies." That limitation means that respondents must show,
among other things, an "injury in fact"--a requirement that
helps assure that courts will not "pass upon . . . abstract,
intellectual problems," but adjudicate "concrete, living contest[s] between adversaries." Coleman v. Miller, 307 U. S.
433, 460 (1939) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting); see also Bennett,

Opinion of the Court
supra, at 167; Lujan, supra, at 560-561. In our view, re-spondents here have suffered a genuine "injury in fact."

The "injury in fact" that respondents have suffered con-sists of their inability to obtain information--lists of AIPAC
donors (who are, according to AIPAC, its members), and
campaign-related contributions and expenditures--that, onrespondents' view of the law, the statute requires that

AIPAC make public. There is no reason to doubt their claimthat the information would help them (and others to whom
they would communicate it) to evaluate candidates for publicoffice, especially candidates who received assistance from
AIPAC, and to evaluate the role that AIPAC's financial assistance might play in a specific election. Respondents' injury consequently seems concrete and particular. Indeed,
this Court has previously held that a plaintiff suffers an "injury in fact" when the plaintiff fails to obtain information
which must be publicly disclosed pursuant to a statute.
Public Citizen v. Department of Justice, 491 U. S. 440, 449
(1989) (failure to obtain information subject to disclosure
under Federal Advisory Committee Act "constitutes a sufficiently distinct injury to provide standing to sue"). See also
Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, 455 U. S. 363, 373-374
(1982) (deprivation of information about housing availability
constitutes "specific injury" permitting standing).

The dissent refers to United States v. Richardson, 418
U. S. 166 (1974), a case in which a plaintiff sought information
(details of Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) expenditures)
to which, he said, the Constitution's Accounts Clause, Art. I,

$ 9, cl. 7, entitled him. The Court held that the plaintiff
there lacked Article III standing. 418 U. S., at 179-180.
The dissent says that Richardson and this case are "indistinguishable." Post, at 34. But as the parties' briefs suggest--for they do not mention Richardson--that case does
not control the outcome here.

Richardson's plaintiff claimed that a statute permitting
the CIA to keep its expenditures nonpublic violated the Ac524US1 Unit: $U72 [09-06-00 17:28:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN
22 FEDERAL ELECTION COMM'N v. AKINS

Opinion of the Court
counts Clause, which requires that "a regular Statement andAccount of the Receipts and Expenditures of all public

Money shall be published from time to time." 418 U. S., at167-169. The Court held that the plaintiff lacked standing
because there was "no `logical nexus' between the [plaintiff 's]
asserted status of taxpayer and the claimed failure of theCongress to require the Executive to supply a more detailed

report of the [CIA's] expenditures." Id., at 175; see also id.,at 174 (quoting

Flast v. Cohen, 392 U. S. 83, 102 (1968), for
the proposition that in "taxpayer standing" cases, theremust be " `a logical nexus between the status asserted and

the claim sought to be adjudicated' ").

In this case, however, the "logical nexus" inquiry is not
relevant. Here, there is no constitutional provision requiring the demonstration of the "nexus" the Court believed
must be shown in Richardson and Flast. Rather, there is a
statute which, as we previously pointed out, supra, at 19-20,
does seek to protect individuals such as respondents from
the kind of harm they say they have suffered, i. e., failing to
receive particular information about campaign-related activities. Cf. Richardson, 418 U. S., at 178, n. 11.

The fact that the Court in Richardson focused upon taxpayer standing, id., at 171-178, not voter standing, places
that case at still a greater distance from the case before us.
We are not suggesting, as the dissent implies, post, at 32-34,
that Richardson would have come out differently if only the
plaintiff had asserted his standing to sue as a voter, rather
than as a taxpayer. Faced with such an assertion, the Richardson Court would simply have had to consider whether
"the Framers . . . ever imagined that general directives [of
the Constitution] . . . would be subject to enforcement by an
individual citizen." 418 U. S., at 178, n. 11 (emphasis added).
But since that answer (like the answer to whether there was
taxpayer standing in Richardson) would have rested in significant part upon the Court's view of the Accounts Clause,
it still would not control our answer in this case. All this is

23Cite as: 524 U. S. 11 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
to say that the legal logic which critically determined Richardson's outcome is beside the point here.

The FEC's strongest argument is its contention that thislawsuit involves only a "generalized grievance." (Indeed, if

Richardson is relevant at all, it is because of its broad discussion of this matter, see id., at 176-178, not its basic ration-ale.) The FEC points out that respondents' asserted harm

(their failure to obtain information) is one which is " `sharedin substantially equal measure by all or a large class of citizens.' " Brief for Petitioner 28 (quoting Warth v. Seldin, 422U. S. 490, 499 (1975)). This Court, the FEC adds, has often
said that "generalized grievance[s]" are not the kinds of
harms that confer standing. Brief for Petitioner 28; see also
Lujan, 504 U. S., at 573-574; Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S.
737, 755-756 (1984); Valley Forge Christian College v.
Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc.,
454 U. S. 464, 475-479 (1982); Richardson, supra, at 176-178;
Frothingham v. Mellon, decided with Massachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U. S. 447, 487 (1923); Ex parte Levitt, 302 U. S. 633,
634 (1937) (per curiam). Whether styled as a constitutional
or prudential limit on standing, the Court has sometimes
determined that where large numbers of Americans suffer
alike, the political process, rather than the judicial process,
may provide the more appropriate remedy for a widely
shared grievance. Warth, supra, at 500; Schlesinger v. Reservists Comm. to Stop the War, 418 U. S. 208, 222 (1974);
Richardson, 418 U. S., at 179; id., at 188-189 (Powell, J., concurring); see also Flast, supra, at 131 (Harlan, J., dissenting).

The kind of judicial language to which the FEC points,
however, invariably appears in cases where the harm at issue
is not only widely shared, but is also of an abstract and indefinite nature--for example, harm to the "common concern
for obedience to law." L. Singer & Sons v. Union Pacific
R. Co., 311 U. S. 295, 303 (1940); see also Allen, supra, at 754;
Schlesinger, supra, at 217. Cf. Lujan, supra, at 572-578

lowed not normally sufficient by itself to confer standing);
Frothingham, supra, at 488 (party may not merely assert
that "he suffers in some indefinite way in common with peo-ple generally");

Perkins v. Lukens Steel Co., 310 U. S. 113,
125 (1940) (plaintiffs lack standing because they have failed
to show injury to "a particular right of their own, as distin-guished from the public's interest in the administration of

the law"). The abstract nature of the harm--for example,injury to the interest in seeing that the law is obeyed--deprives the case of the concrete specificity that characterizedthose controversies which were "the traditional concern of
the courts at Westminster," Coleman, 307 U. S., at 460
(Frankfurter, J., dissenting); and which today prevents a
plaintiff from obtaining what would, in effect, amount to an
advisory opinion. Cf. Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Haworth, 300
U. S. 227, 240-241 (1937).

Often the fact that an interest is abstract and the fact that
it is widely shared go hand in hand. But their association is
not invariable, and where a harm is concrete, though widely
shared, the Court has found "injury in fact." See Public
Citizen, 491 U. S., at 449-450 ("The fact that other citizens
or groups of citizens might make the same complaint after
unsuccessfully demanding disclosure . . . does not lessen
[their] asserted injury"). Thus the fact that a political forum
may be more readily available where an injury is widely
shared (while counseling against, say, interpreting a statute
as conferring standing) does not, by itself, automatically disqualify an interest for Article III purposes. Such an interest, where sufficiently concrete, may count as an "injury in
fact." This conclusion seems particularly obvious where (to
use a hypothetical example) large numbers of individuals suffer the same common-law injury (say, a widespread mass
tort), or where large numbers of voters suffer interference
with voting rights conferred by law. Cf. Lujan, supra, at
572; Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U. S. 899, 905 (1996). We conclude
that, similarly, the informational injury at issue here, di524US1 Unit: $U72 [09-06-00 17:28:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN

25Cite as: 524 U. S. 11 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
rectly related to voting, the most basic of political rights, issufficiently concrete and specific such that the fact that it is

widely shared does not deprive Congress of constitutionalpower to authorize its vindication in the federal courts.

Respondents have also satisfied the remaining two constitutional standing requirements. The harm asserted is"fairly traceable" to the FEC's decision about which respondents complain. Of course, as the FEC points out, Brief forPetitioner 29-31, it is possible that even had the FEC agreed
with respondents' view of the law, it would still have decidedin the exercise of its discretion not to require AIPAC to
produce the information. Cf. App. to Pet. for Cert. 98a (deciding to exercise prosecutorial discretion, see Heckler v.
Chaney, 470 U. S. 821 (1985), and "take no further action" on

$ 441b allegation against AIPAC). But that fact does not
destroy Article III "causation," for we cannot know that the
FEC would have exercised its prosecutorial discretion in this
way. Agencies often have discretion about whether or not
to take a particular action. Yet those adversely affected by
a discretionary agency decision generally have standing to
complain that the agency based its decision upon an improper
legal ground. See, e. g., Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner,
387 U. S. 136, 140 (1967) (discussing presumption of reviewability of agency action); Citizens to Preserve Overton Park,
Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U. S. 402, 410 (1971). If a reviewing court
agrees that the agency misinterpreted the law, it will set
aside the agency's action and remand the case--even though
the agency (like a new jury after a mistrial) might later, in
the exercise of its lawful discretion, reach the same result
for a different reason. SEC v. Chenery Corp., 318 U. S. 80
(1943). Thus respondents' "injury in fact" is "fairly traceable" to the FEC's decision not to issue its complaint, even
though the FEC might reach the same result exercising its
discretionary powers lawfully. For similar reasons, the
courts in this case can "redress" respondents' "injury in
fact."

26 FEDERAL ELECTION COMM'N v. AKINS

Opinion of the Court
Finally, the FEC argues that we should deny respondentsstanding because this case involves an agency's decision not

to undertake an enforcement action--an area generally notsubject to judicial review. Brief for Petitioner 23, 29. In
Heckler, this Court noted that agency enforcement decisions
"ha[ve] traditionally been `committed to agency discretion,' "and concluded that Congress did not intend to alter that tradition in enacting the APA. 470 U. S., at 832; cf. 5 U. S. C.$ 701(a) (courts will not review agency actions where "statutes preclude judicial review," or where the "agency actionis committed to agency discretion by law"). We deal here
with a statute that explicitly indicates the contrary.In sum, respondents, as voters, have satisfied both prudential and constitutional standing requirements. They
may bring this petition for a declaration that the FEC'sdismissal of their complaint was unlawful. See 2 U. S. C.

$ 437g(a)(8)(A).

III

The second question presented in the FEC's petition for
certiorari is whether an organization that otherwise satisfies
the Act's definition of a "political committee," and thus is
subject to its disclosure requirements, nonetheless falls outside that definition because "its major purpose" is not "the
nomination or election of candidates." The question arises
because this Court, in Buckley, said:

"To fulfill the purposes of the Act [the term `political
committee'] need only encompass organizations that are
under the control of a candidate or the major purpose of
which is the nomination or election of a candidate." 424
U. S., at 79.

The Court reiterated in Federal Election Comm'n v. Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc., 479 U. S. 238, 252, n. 6 (1986):

"[A]n entity subject to regulation as a `political committee' under the Act is one that is either `under the control

524US1 Unit: $U72 [09-06-00 17:28:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN

27Cite as: 524 U. S. 11 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
of a candidate or the major purpose of which is the nomi-nation or election of a candidate.' "

The FEC here interpreted this language as narrowing thescope of the statutory term "political committee," wherever
applied. And, as we have said, the FEC's General Coun-sel found that AIPAC fell outside that definition because
the nomination or election of a candidate was not AIPAC's"major purpose." App. 146.

The en banc Court of Appeals disagreed with the FEC.It read this Court's narrowing construction of the term "political committee" as turning on the First Amendment prob-lems presented by regulation of "independent expenditures"
(i. e., "an expenditure by a person expressly advocating theelection or defeat of a clearly identified candidate which is
made without cooperation or consultation with any candi-date," $ 431(17)). 101 F. 3d, at 741. The Court of Appeals
concluded that the language in this Court's prior decisionsnarrowing the definition of "political committee" did not
apply where the special First Amendment "independentexpenditure" problem did not exist. Id., at 742-743.

The Solicitor General argues that this Court's narrowingdefinition of "political committee" applies not simply in the
context of independent expenditures, but across the board.We cannot squarely address that matter, however, because
of the unusual and complex circumstances in which this casearises. As we previously mentioned,

supra, at 16-17, theFEC considered a related question, namely, whether AIPAC

was exempt from $ 441b's prohibition of corporate campaignexpenditures, on the grounds that the so-called "expenditures" involved only AIPAC's communications with its mem-bers. The FEC held that the statute's exception to the "expenditure" definition for communications by a "membershiporganization" did not apply because many of the persons who
belonged to AIPAC were not "members" as defined by FECregulation. The FEC acknowledged, however, that this was
a "close question." App. to Pet. for Cert. 98a; see also App.

524US1 Unit: $U72 [09-06-00 17:28:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN
28 FEDERAL ELECTION COMM'N v. AKINS

Opinion of the Court
144-146, 170-171. In particular, the FEC thought thatmany of the persons who belonged to AIPAC lacked sufficient control of the organization's policies to qualify as "mem-bers" for purposes of the Act.

A few months later, however, the Court of Appeals overturned the FEC's regulations defining "members," in partbecause that court thought the regulations defined membership organizations too narrowly in light of an organiza-tion's "First Amendment right to communicate with its
`members.' " Chamber of Commerce v. Federal Election
Comm'n, 69 F. 3d 600, 605 (CADC 1995). The FEC has
subsequently issued proposed rules redefining "members."
Under these rules, it is quite possible that many of the persons who belong to AIPAC would be considered "members."
If so, the communications here at issue apparently would not
count as the kind of "expenditures" that can turn an organization into a "political committee," and AIPAC would fall
outside the definition for that reason, rather than because of
the "major purpose" test. 62 Fed. Reg. 66832 (1997) (proposed 11 CFR pts. 100 and 114).

The consequence for our consideration of Question Two
now is that the FEC's new rules defining "membership organization" could significantly affect the interpretive issue presented by this question. If the Court of Appeals is right in
saying that this Court's narrowing interpretation of "political committee" in Buckley reflected First Amendment concerns, 101 F. 3d, at 741, then whether the "membership communications" exception is interpreted broadly or narrowly
could affect our evaluation of the Court of Appeals' claim
that there is no constitutionally driven need to apply Buckley's narrowing interpretation in this context. The scope of
the "membership communications" exception could also affect our evaluation of the Solicitor General's related argument that First Amendment concerns (reflected in Buckley's
narrowing interpretation) are present whenever the Act requires disclosure. In any event, it is difficult to decide the

524US1 Unit: $U72 [09-06-00 17:28:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN

29Cite as: 524 U. S. 11 (1998)
Scalia, J., dissenting
basic issue that Question Two presents without consideringthe special communicative nature of the "expenditures" here

at issue, cf. United States v. CIO, 335 U. S. 106, 121 (1948)(describing relation between membership communications
and constitutionally protected rights of association). And, a
considered determination of the scope of the statutory ex-emption that Congress enacted to address membership communications would helpfully inform our consideration of the"major purpose" test.

The upshot, in our view, is that we should permit the FECto address, in the first instance, the issue presented by Question Two. We can thereby take advantage of the relevantagency's expertise, by allowing it to develop a more precise
rule that may dispose of this case, or at a minimum, will aid
the Court in reaching a more informed conclusion. In our
view, the FEC should proceed to determine whether or not
AIPAC's expenditures qualify as "membership communications," and thereby fall outside the scope of "expenditures"
that could qualify it as a "political committee." If the FEC
decides that despite its new rules, the communications here
do not qualify for this exception, then the lower courts, in
reconsidering respondents' arguments, can still evaluate the
significance of the communicative context in which the case
arises. If, on the other hand, the FEC decides that AIPAC's
activities fall within the "membership communications" exception, the matter will become moot.

For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals
is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings
consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Justice Scalia, with whom Justice O'Connor and
Justice Thomas join, dissenting.

The provision of law at issue in this case is an extraordinary one, conferring upon a private person the ability to
bring an Executive agency into court to compel its enforce524US1 Unit: $U72 [09-06-00 17:28:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Scalia, J., dissenting
ment of the law against a third party. Despite its liberality,the Administrative Procedure Act does not allow such suits,

since enforcement action is traditionally deemed "committedto agency discretion by law." 5 U. S. C. $ 701(a)(2); Heckler
v. Chaney, 470 U. S. 821, 827-835 (1985). If provisions suchas the present one were commonplace, the role of the Executive Branch in our system of separated and equilibrated pow-ers would be greatly reduced, and that of the Judiciary
greatly expanded.Because this provision is so extraordinary, we should be
particularly careful not to expand it beyond its fair meaning.In my view the Court's opinion does that. Indeed, it expands the meaning beyond what the Constitution permits.

I
It is clear that the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971(FECA or Act) does not intend that

all persons filing com-plaints with the Federal Election Commission have the right

to seek judicial review of the rejection of their complaints.This is evident from the fact that the Act permits a complaint
to be filed by "[a]ny person who believes a violation of thisAct . . . has occurred," 2 U. S. C. $ 437g(a)(1) (emphasis
added), but accords a right to judicial relief only to "[a]ny
party aggrieved by an order of the Commission dismissing acomplaint filed by such party," $ 437g(a)(8)(A) (emphasis

added). The interpretation that the Court gives the latterprovision deprives it of almost all its limiting force. Any
voter can sue to compel the agency to require registration ofan entity as a political committee, even though the "aggrievement" consists of nothing more than the deprivation of ac-cess to information whose public availability would have
been one of the consequences of registration.This seems to me too much of a stretch. It should be
borne in mind that the agency action complained of here isnot the refusal to make available information in its possession that the Act requires to be disclosed. A person de524US1 Unit: $U72 [09-06-00 17:28:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN

31Cite as: 524 U. S. 11 (1998)
Scalia, J., dissenting
manding provision of information that the law requires theagency to furnish--one demanding compliance with the

Freedom of Information Act or the Federal Advisory Com-mittee Act, for example--can reasonably be described as
being "aggrieved" by the agency's refusal to provide it.
What the respondents complain of in this suit, however, isnot the refusal to provide information, but the refusal (for

an allegedly improper reason) to commence an agency en-forcement action against a third person. That refusal

itself
plainly does not render respondents "aggrieved" within themeaning of the Act, for in that case there would have been

no reason for the Act to differentiate between "person" in
subsection (a)(1) and "party aggrieved" in subsection (a)(8).
Respondents claim that each of them is elevated to the special status of a "party aggrieved" by the fact that the requested enforcement action (if it was successful) would have
had the effect, among others, of placing certain information
in the agency's possession, where respondents, along with
everyone else in the world, would have had access to it. It
seems to me most unlikely that the failure to produce that
effect--both a secondary consequence of what respondents
immediately seek, and a consequence that affects respondents no more and with no greater particularity than it affects
virtually the entire population--would have been meant to
set apart each respondent as a "party aggrieved" (as opposed
to just a rejected complainant) within the meaning of the
statute.

This conclusion is strengthened by the fact that this
citizen-suit provision was enacted two years after this
Court's decision in United States v. Richardson, 418 U. S.
166 (1974), which, as I shall discuss at greater length below,
gave Congress every reason to believe that a voter's interest
in information helpful to his exercise of the franchise was
constitutionally inadequate to confer standing. Richardson had said that a plaintiff 's complaint that the Government
was unlawfully depriving him of information he needed to

524US1 Unit: $U72 [09-06-00 17:28:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN
32 FEDERAL ELECTION COMM'N v. AKINS

Scalia, J., dissenting
"properly fulfill his obligations as a member of the electoratein voting" was "surely the kind of a generalized grievance"

that does not state an Article III case or controversy. Id.,at 176.

And finally, a narrower reading of "party aggrieved" issupported by the doctrine of constitutional doubt, which
counsels us to interpret statutes, if possible, in such fashionas to avoid grave constitutional questions. See

UnitedStates ex rel. Attorney General v. Delaware & Hudson Co.,

213 U. S. 366, 408 (1909); Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Flor-ida Gulf Coast Building & Constr. Trades Council, 485 U. S.
568, 575 (1988). As I proceed to discuss, it is my view thatthe Court's entertainment of the present suit violates
Article III. Even if one disagrees with that judgment, how-ever, it is clear from

Richardson that the question is a closeone, so that the statute ought not be interpreted to present it. II

In Richardson, we dismissed for lack of standing a suitwhose "aggrievement" was precisely the "aggrievement" respondents assert here: the Government's unlawful refusal toplace information within the public domain. The only difference, in fact, is that the aggrievement there was more direct,since the Government already had the information within
its possession, whereas here respondents seek enforcementaction that will bring information within the Government's
possession and then require the information to be made public. The plaintiff in Richardson challenged the Govern-ment's failure to disclose the expenditures of the Central

Intelligence Agency (CIA), in alleged violation of the constitutional requirement, Art. I, $ 9, cl. 7, that "a regular State-ment and Account of the Receipts and Expenditures of all

public Money shall be published from time to time." Weheld that such a claim was a nonjusticiable "generalized
grievance" because "the impact on [plaintiff] is plainly undif524US1 Unit: $U72 [09-06-00 17:28:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ferentiated and common to all members of the public." 418U. S., at 176-177 (internal quotation marks and citations

omitted).It was alleged in Richardson that the Government had
denied a right conferred by the Constitution, whereas re-spondents here assert a right conferred by statute--but of
course "there is absolutely no basis for making the ArticleIII inquiry turn on the source of the asserted right."

Lujanv. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 576 (1992). The

Court today distinguishes Richardson on a different basis--a basis that reduces it from a landmark constitutional holding
to a curio. According to the Court, "Richardson focusedupon taxpayer standing, . . . not voter standing."

Ante,at 22. In addition to being a silly distinction, given the

weighty governmental purpose underlying the "generalizedgrievance" prohibition--viz., to avoid "something in the
nature of an Athenian democracy or a New England townmeeting to oversee the conduct of the National Government
by means of lawsuits in federal courts," 418 U. S., at 179--this is also a distinction that the Court in

Richardson wentout of its way explicitly to eliminate. It is true enough

that the narrow question presented in Richardson was" `[w]hether a federal taxpayer has standing,' "

id., at 167,
n. 1. But the Richardson Court did not hold only, as theCourt today suggests, that the plaintiff failed to qualify for

the exception to the rule of no taxpayer standing establishedby the "logical nexus" test of

Flast v. Cohen, 392 U. S. 83
(1968).* The plaintiff 's complaint in Richardson had also alleged that he was " `a member of the electorate,' " 418 U. S.,at 167, n. 1, and he asserted injury in that capacity as well.

*That holding was inescapable since, as the Court made clear in another
case handed down the same day, "the Flast nexus test is not applicable
where the taxing and spending power is not challenged" (as in Richardson
it was not). Schlesinger v. Reservists Comm. to Stop the War, 418 U. S.
208, 225, n. 15 (1974).

34 FEDERAL ELECTION COMM'N v. AKINS

Scalia, J., dissenting
The Richardson opinion treated that as fairly includedwithin the taxpayer-standing question, or at least as plainly

indistinguishable from it:

"The respondent's claim is that without detailed information on CIA expenditures--and hence its activities--he cannot intelligently follow the actions of Congress or

the Executive, nor can he properly fulfill his obligations as a member of the electorate in voting for candidates seeking national office."

This is surely the kind of a generalized grievance
described in both Frothingham and Flast since the impact on him is plainly undifferentiated and common toall members of the public."

Id., at 176-177 (citations
and internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added).

If Richardson left voter standing unaffected, one must marvel at the unaccustomed ineptitude of the American CivilLiberties Union Foundation, which litigated

Richardson, in
not immediately refiling with an explicit voter-standing alle-gation. Fairly read, and applying a fair understanding of its

important purposes, Richardson is indistinguishable fromthe present case.

The Court's opinion asserts that our language disapprov-ing generalized grievances "invariably appears in cases
where the harm at issue is not only widely shared, but is also
of an abstract and indefinite nature." Ante, at 23. "Often,"the Court says, "the fact that an interest is abstract and

the fact that it is widely shared go hand in hand. But theirassociation is not invariable, and where a harm is concrete,
though widely shared, the Court has found `injury in fact.' "
Ante, at 24. If that is so--if concrete generalized grievances
(like concrete particularized grievances) are OK, and abstract generalized grievances (like abstract particularized
grievances) are bad--one must wonder why we ever developed the superfluous distinction between generalized and
particularized grievances at all. But of course the Court is

35Cite as: 524 U. S. 11 (1998)
Scalia, J., dissenting
wrong to think that generalized grievances have only con-cerned us when they are abstract. One need go no further

than Richardson to prove that--unless the Court believesthat deprivation of information is an abstract injury, in which
event this case could be disposed of on that much broader
ground.What is noticeably lacking in the Court's discussion of our

generalized-grievance jurisprudence is all reference to twowords that have figured in it prominently: "particularized"
and "undifferentiated." See Richardson, supra, at 177;
Lujan, 504 U. S., at 560, and n. 1. "Particularized" means
that "the injury must affect the plaintiff in a personal and
individual way." Id., at 560, n. 1. If the effect is "undifferentiated and common to all members of the public," Richardson, supra, at 177 (internal quotation marks and citations
omitted), the plaintiff has a "generalized grievance" that
must be pursued by political, rather than judicial, means.
These terms explain why it is a gross oversimplification to
reduce the concept of a generalized grievance to nothing
more than "the fact that [the grievance] is widely shared,"
ante, at 25, thereby enabling the concept to be dismissed as
a standing principle by such examples as "large numbers of
individuals suffer[ing] the same common-law injury (say, a
widespread mass tort), or . . . large numbers of voters suffer[ing] interference with voting rights conferred by law,"
ante, at 24. The exemplified injuries are widely shared, to
be sure, but each individual suffers a particularized and
differentiated harm. One tort victim suffers a burnt leg,
another a burnt arm--or even if both suffer burnt arms they
are different arms. One voter suffers the deprivation of
his franchise, another the deprivation of hers. With the
generalized grievance, on the other hand, the injury or deprivation is not only widely shared but it is undifferentiated.
The harm caused to Mr. Richardson by the alleged disregard
of the Statement-of-Accounts Clause was precisely the same
as the harm caused to everyone else: unavailability of a de524US1 Unit: $U72 [09-06-00 17:28:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN
36 FEDERAL ELECTION COMM'N v. AKINS

Scalia, J., dissenting
scription of CIA expenditures. Just as the (more indirect)
harm caused to Mr. Akins by the allegedly unlawful failure
to enforce FECA is precisely the same as the harm caused
to everyone else: unavailability of a description of AIPAC's
activities.

The Constitution's line of demarcation between the Executive power and the judicial power presupposes a common understanding of the type of interest needed to sustain a "case
or controversy" against the Executive in the courts. A system in which the citizenry at large could sue to compel Executive compliance with the law would be a system in which
the courts, rather than the President, are given the primary
responsibility to "take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed," Art. II, $ 3. We do not have such a system because
the common understanding of the interest necessary to sustain suit has included the requirement, affirmed in Richardson, that the complained-of injury be particularized and differentiated, rather than common to all the electorate. When
the Executive can be directed by the courts, at the instance
of any voter, to remedy a deprivation that affects the entire
electorate in precisely the same way--and particularly when
that deprivation (here, the unavailability of information) is
one inseverable part of a larger enforcement scheme--there
has occurred a shift of political responsibility to a branch
designed not to protect the public at large but to protect
individual rights. "To permit Congress to convert the undifferentiated public interest in executive officers' compliance with the law into an `individual right' vindicable in the
courts is to permit Congress to transfer from the President
to the courts the Chief Executive's most important constitutional duty . . . ." Lujan, supra, at 577. If today's decision
is correct, it is within the power of Congress to authorize
any interested person to manage (through the courts) the
Executive's enforcement of any law that includes a requirement for the filing and public availability of a piece of paper.

UNITED STATES v. BEGGERLY et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fifth circuit

No. 97-731. Argued April 27, 1998--Decided June 8, 1998
In 1979, the United States sued respondents and others to quiet title to

land it sought for a federal park, contending that respondents did not
have clear title because the Government had never patented the disputed land after acquiring it as part of the Louisiana Purchase. Government officials searched public land records during discovery, but reported to respondents that they found no proof of a grant to a private
landowner. A 1982 settlement agreement quieted title in the Government's favor in return for a payment to respondents. In 1994, respondents sued to set aside the settlement agreement and obtain damages,
claiming that they had evidence showing that the land had been granted
to a private owner before the Louisiana Purchase, but the District Court
concluded that it had no jurisdiction to hear the case. The Fifth Circuit
reversed, finding two jurisdictional bases: (1) the suit was an "independent action" to set aside the settlement under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b); and (2) the Quiet Title Act (QTA or Act). In reaching the
second conclusion, the court found that the QTA's 12-year statute of
limitations was subject to equitable tolling and therefore suit was not
barred by the fact that respondents had known about the Government's
claim since 1979. The court then vacated the settlement agreement and
instructed the District Court to quiet title in respondents' favor.

Held: The Fifth Circuit had no jurisdiction over respondents' suit.

Pp. 42-49.

(a) Rule 60(b)'s history and language are inconsistent with the Government's position that an "independent action" to set aside a judgment
requires an independent source of jurisdiction. The original Rule 60(b)
established a new system to govern requests to reopen judgments. Because it was unclear whether that Rule provided the exclusive means
for obtaining postjudgment relief, the Rule was amended in 1946 to
clarify that nearly all of the old forms of obtaining relief from a judgment were abolished but that the "independent action" survived. However, this does not mean that the requirements for a meritorious independent action have been met here. Such actions should be available
only to prevent a grave miscarriage of justice. See Hazel-Atlas Glass
Co. v. Hartford-Empire Co., 322 U. S. 238, 244. Respondents' allegation
that the United States failed to thoroughly search its records and make

full disclosure to the District Court regarding the land grant obviously
does not approach this demanding standard. Pp. 42-47.

(b) Equitable tolling is not available in a QTA suit. Such tolling is
not permissible where it is inconsistent with the relevant statute's text.
The QTA's express 12-year statute of limitations runs from the date the
plaintiff or his predecessor in interest "knew or should have known" of
the United States' claim. 28 U. S. C. $ 2409(g). Thus, the Act has already effectively allowed for equitable tolling. See Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs, 498 U. S. 89, 96. Given this fact and the
QTA's unusually generous limitations period, extension of the statutory
period would be unwarranted. Pp. 47-49.

In 1979, the United States brought a quiet title action (the
Adams litigation) in the Southern District of Mississippiagainst respondents and nearly 200 other defendants. On

the eve of trial, the Government and respondents enteredinto a settlement whereby title to the disputed land was
quieted in favor of the United States in return for a paymentof $208,175.87. Judgment was entered based on this settlement agreement. In 1994, some 12 years after that judg-ment, respondents sued in the District Court to set aside the
settlement agreement and obtain a damages award for thedisputed land. Their claims for relief were based on the

Opinion of the Court
court's ancillary jurisdiction, relating back to the Adamslitigation, and on the Quiet Title Act (QTA). 28 U. S. C.

$ 2409a. We hold that respondents were not entitled torelief on either of these grounds.

The land in dispute between the United States and respondents is located on Horn Island. Situated in the Gulfof Mexico approximately 13 miles southwest of Pascagoula,

Horn Island is currently within the State of Mississippi. Itwas, at various times during the late 18th and early 19th
centuries, controlled by France, Britain, and Spain. It ispart of the territory that came under the control of the
United States as a result of the Louisiana Purchase of 1803.
In 1950, Clark Beggerly, respondents' predecessor-ininterest, purchased color of title to two tracts of land on Horn
Island at a tax sale in Jackson County. Beggerly paid $51.20
for one 626-acre tract. He and a friend also purchased a
second tract for $31.25. Beggerly retained 103 acres upon a
later division of this second tract.

In 1971, Congress enacted legislation authorizing the Department of the Interior to create the Gulf Islands National
Seashore, a federal park on lands that include Horn Island.
16 U. S. C. $ 459h. The legislation authorized the Secretary
of the Interior to acquire privately owned lands within the
proposed park's boundaries. $ 459h-1. The National Park
Service (NPS) began negotiating with respondents to purchase the land. Before any deal could be completed, however, the NPS learned that the United States Government
had never patented the property. Believing that this meant
that respondents could not have had clear title, the NPS
backed out of the proposed deal.

During discovery in the Adams litigation, respondents
sought proof of their title to the land. Government officials
searched public land records and told respondents that they
had found nothing proving that any part of Horn Island had
ever been granted to a private landowner. Even after the
settlement in the Adams litigation, however, respondents

Opinion of the Court
continued to search for evidence of a land patent that sup-ported their claim of title. In 1991 they hired a genealogical

record specialist to conduct research in the National Ar-chives in Washington. The specialist found materials that,
according to her, showed that on August 1, 1781, Bernardo
de Galvez, then the Governor General of Spanish Louisiana,granted Horn Island to Catarina Boudreau. If the land had

been granted to a private party prior to 1803, title presum-ably could not have passed to the United States as a result
of the Louisiana Purchase. Respondents believed that theBoudreau grant proved that their claim to the disputed land
was superior to that of the United States.Armed with this new information, respondents filed a complaint in the District Court on June 1, 1994. They asked the
court to set aside the 1982 settlement agreement and awardthem damages of "not less than $14,500 per acre" of the disputed land. App. 26. The District Court concluded that itwas without jurisdiction to hear respondents' suit and dismissed the complaint.The Court of Appeals reversed. It concluded that there
were two jurisdictional bases for the suit. First, the suitsatisfied the elements of an "independent action," as the
term is used in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b). According to the Court of Appeals, those elements are:

"(1) a judgment which ought not, in equity and goodconscience, to be enforced; (2) a good defense to the alleged cause of action on which the judgment is founded;
(3) fraud, accident, or mistake which prevented the de-fendant in the judgment from obtaining the benefit of

his defense; (4) the absence of fault or negligence on the
part of the defendant; and (5) the absence of any adequate remedy at law." 114 F. 3d 484, 487 (CA5 1997).

In its view, the settlement agreement could therefore be set
aside. Second, the Court of Appeals concluded that the QTA
conferred jurisdiction. The QTA includes a 12-year statute

42 UNITED STATES v. BEGGERLY

Opinion of the Court
of limitations, which begins to run from the date the plaintiffknows or should have known about the claim of the United

States. 28 U. S. C. $ 2409a(g). The Court of Appeals notedthat respondents knew about the Government's claim for
more than 12 years before it filed this suit, but concluded
that the 12-year statute was subject to equitable tolling andshould be tolled in this case.

Satisfied as to its jurisdiction, the Court of Appeals thenaddressed the merits. Relying on the Boudreau grant, the
court concluded that the "United States has no legitimateclaim to the land [and that] the validity of the Beggerlys'
title is a legal certainty." 114 F. 3d, at 489. It therefore
vacated the settlement agreement and remanded the case to
the District Court with instructions that it enter judgment
quieting title in favor of respondents. One judge dissented.
We granted certiorari, 522 U. S. 1038 (1998), and now reverse.

The Government's primary contention is that the Court
of Appeals erred in concluding that it had jurisdiction over
respondents' 1994 suit. It first attacks the lower court's
conclusion that jurisdiction was established because the
suit was an "independent action" within the meaning of Rule
60(b). The Government argues that an "independent action" must be supported by an independent source of jurisdiction, and, in the case of a suit against the United States,
an independent waiver of sovereign immunity. Whereas the
District Court had jurisdiction over the original Adams litigation because the United States was the plaintiff, 28 U. S. C.

$ 1345, there was no statutory basis for the Beggerlys' 1994
action, and the District Court was therefore correct to have
dismissed it.

We think the Government's position is inconsistent with
the history and language of Rule 60(b). Prior to the 1937
adoption of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the availability of relief from a judgment or order turned on whether
the court was still in the same "term" in which the challenged judgment was entered. If it was, the judge "had ple524US1 Unit: $U73 [09-06-00 17:32:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN

nary power . . . to modify his judgment for error of fact orlaw or even revoke it altogether." Zimmern v. United

States, 298 U. S. 167, 169-170 (1936). If the term had ex-pired, resort had to be made to a handful of writs, the precise
contours of which were "shrouded in ancient lore and mys-tery." Advisory Committee's Notes on 1946 Amdt. to Fed.
Rule Civ. Proc. 60, 28 U. S. C. App., p. 787. The new FederalRules of Civil Procedure did away with the notion that the
continuation or expiration of a term of court had any affecton a court's power. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 6(c), rescinded 1966.
New Rule 60(b) 1 sought to establish a new system to gov-ern requests to reopen judgments. The original Rule 60(b)
provided:

"(b) Mistake; Inadvertence; Surprise; Excusable Ne-glect. On motion the court, upon such terms as are

just, may relieve a party or his legal representative froma judgment, order, or proceeding taken against him
through his mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excus-able neglect. The motion shall be made within a reasonable time, but in no case exceeding six months aftersuch judgment, order, or proceeding was taken. A motion under this subdivision does not affect the finality ofa judgment or suspend its operation. This rule does
not limit the power of a court (1) to entertain an actionto relieve a party from a judgment, order, or proceeding,
or (2) to set aside within one year, as provided in Section57 of the Judicial Code, U. S. C., Title 28, $ 118, a judgment obtained against a defendant not actually person-ally notified." Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 60(b) (1940).

In the years following the adoption of the Rules, however,courts differed over whether the new Rule 60(b) provided
the exclusive means for obtaining postjudgment relief, orwhether the writs that had been used prior to the adoption of

1 Rule 60(a) dealt then, as it deals now, with relief from clerical mistakes
in judgments.

Opinion of the Court
the Federal Rules still survived. This problem, along with
several others, was addressed in the 1946 amendment to
Rule 60(b). The 1946 amendment revised the Rule to read
substantially as it reads now:

"(b) Mistakes; Inadvertence; Excusable Neglect; Newly
Discovered Evidence; Fraud, Etc. On motion and upon
such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or
a party's legal representative from a final judgment,
order, or proceeding for the following reasons: (1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect; (2)
newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could
not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial
under Rule 59(b); (3) fraud (whether heretofore denominated intrinsic or extrinsic), misrepresentation, or other
misconduct of an adverse party; (4) the judgment is void;
(5) the judgment has been satisfied, released, or discharged, or a prior judgment upon which it is based has
been reversed or otherwise vacated, or it is no longer
equitable that the judgment should have prospective application; or (6) any other reason justifying relief from
the operation of the judgment. The motion shall be
made within a reasonable time, and for reasons (1), (2),
and (3) not more than one year after the judgment,
order, or proceeding was entered or taken. A motion
under this subdivision (b) does not affect the finality of
a judgment or suspend its operation. This rule does
not limit the power of a court to entertain an independent action to relieve a party from a judgment, order, or
proceeding, or to grant relief to a defendant not actually
personally notified as provided in Title 28, U. S. C.,

$ 1655, or to set aside a judgment for fraud upon the
court. Writs of coram nobis, coram vobis, audita querela, and bills of review and bills in the nature of a bill
of review, are abolished, and the procedure for obtaining
any relief from a judgment shall be by motion as pre524US1 Unit: $U73 [09-06-00 17:32:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN

scribed in these rules or by an independent action."Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 60(b).

The new Rule thus made clear that nearly all of the oldforms of obtaining relief from a judgment, i. e., coram nobis,
coram vobis, audita querela, bills of review, and bills in thenature of review, had been abolished. The revision made
equally clear, however, that one of the old forms, i. e., the"independent action,"

2 still survived. The Advisory Committee notes confirmed this, indicating that "[i]f the right tomake a motion is lost by the expiration of the time limits

fixed in these rules, the only other procedural remedy is bya new or independent action to set aside a judgment upon
those principles which have heretofore been applied in suchan action." Advisory Committee's Notes,

supra, at 787.The "independent action" sounded in equity. While its

precise contours are somewhat unclear, it appears to havebeen more broadly available than the more narrow writs that
the 1946 amendment abolished. One case that exemplifiesthe category is

Pacific R. Co. of Mo. v. Missouri Pacific R.Co., 111 U. S. 505 (1884).

In Pacific the underlying suit had resulted in a court de-cree foreclosing a mortgage on railroad property and ordering its sale. This Court enforced the decree and shortlythereafter the railroad company whose property had been
foreclosed filed a bill to impeach for fraud the foreclosuredecree that had just been affirmed. The bill alleged that
the plaintiffs in the underlying suit had conspired with theattorney and directors of the plaintiff in the subsequent suit
to ensure that the property would be forfeited. The plain-tiff in the subsequent suit was a Missouri corporation, and it

46 UNITED STATES v. BEGGERLY

Opinion of the Court
named several other Missouri citizens as defendants in itsbill seeking relief from the prior judgment.

When the matter reached this Court, we rejected the con-tention that the federal courts had no jurisdiction over the
bill because the plaintiff and several of the defendants were
from the same State. We first noted that there was no ques-tion as to the court's jurisdiction over the underlying suit,

and then said:

"On the question of jurisdiction the [subsequent] suitmay be regarded as ancillary to the [prior] suit, so that

the relief asked may be granted by the court which
made the decree in that suit, without regard to the citi-zenship of the present parties . . . . The bill, though

an original bill in the chancery sense of the word, is acontinuation of the former suit, on the question of the
jurisdiction of the Circuit Court." Id., at 522.
Even though there was no diversity, the Court relied on the
underlying suit as the basis for jurisdiction and allowed theindependent action to proceed. The Government is therefore wrong to suggest that an independent action brought inthe same court as the original lawsuit requires an independent basis for jurisdiction.This is not to say, however, that the requirements for a
meritorious independent action have been met here. If relief may be obtained through an independent action in a casesuch as this, where the most that may be charged against

the Government is a failure to furnish relevant informationthat would at best form the basis for a Rule 60(b)(3) motion,
the strict 1-year time limit on such motions would be set at
naught. Independent actions must, if Rule 60(b) is to be
interpreted as a coherent whole, be reserved for those cases
of "injustices which, in certain instances, are deemed sufficiently gross to demand a departure" from rigid adherence
to the doctrine of res judicata. Hazel-Atlas Glass Co. v.
Hartford-Empire Co., 322 U. S. 238, 244 (1944).

Opinion of the Court
Such a case was Marshall v. Holmes, 141 U. S. 589 (1891),in which the plaintiff alleged that judgment had been taken

against her in the underlying action as a result of a forgeddocument. The Court said:

"According to the averments of the original petition forinjunction . . . the judgments in question would not have
been rendered against Mrs. Marshall but for the use inevidence of the letter alleged to be forged. The case
evidently intended to be presented by the petition is onewhere, without negligence, laches or other fault upon
the part of petitioner, [respondent] has fraudulently ob-tained judgments which he seeks, against conscience, to
enforce by execution." Id., at 596.
The sense of these expressions is that, under the Rule, anindependent action should be available only to prevent a

grave miscarriage of justice. In this case, it should be obvi-ous that respondents' allegations do not nearly approach this
demanding standard. Respondents allege only that theUnited States failed to "thoroughly search its records and
make full disclosure to the Court" regarding the Boudreaugrant. App. 23. Whether such a claim might succeed
under Rule 60(b)(3), we need not now decide; it surely wouldwork no "grave miscarriage of justice," and perhaps no miscarriage of justice at all, to allow the judgment to stand.We therefore hold that the Court of Appeals erred in concluding that this was a sufficient basis to justify the reopen-ing of the judgment in the

Adams litigation.4The Court of Appeals did not, however, merely reopen the

Adams litigation. It also directed the District Court toquiet title to the property in respondents' favor. The Court
of Appeals believed that the QTA, 28 U. S. C. $ 2409a, pro-vided jurisdiction to do this. The QTA permits "plaintiffs

4 We therefore need not address the additional requirement that evidence of the Boudreau grant would have changed the outcome of the original action. See, e. g., Pickford v. Talbott, 225 U. S. 651, 657 (1912).

to name [the United States] as a party defendant in civil actions to adjudicate title disputes involving real property in
which the United States claims an interest." Block v. North
Dakota ex rel. Board of Univ. and School Lands, 461 U. S.
273, 275-276 (1983). The QTA includes an express 12-year
statute of limitations, which begins to run from the date
upon which the plaintiff 's cause of action accrued. An
action under the QTA "shall be deemed to have accrued
on the date the plaintiff or his predecessor in interest knew
or should have known of the claim of the United States."

$ 2409a(g).

The Court of Appeals acknowledged that the Beggerlys
had known about the Government's claim to the land since
at least 1979, more than 12 years before they filed this action
in 1994. It concluded that the suit was not barred, however,
because the QTA's statute of limitations was subject to equitable tolling, and that, "in light of the diligence displayed
by the [respondents] in seeking the truth and pursuing their
rights," equity demanded that the statute be tolled in this
case. 114 F. 3d, at 489. In our view, the Court of Appeals
was wrong in deciding that equitable tolling is available in a
QTA suit.

Equitable tolling is not permissible where it is inconsistent
with the text of the relevant statute. United States v.
Brockamp, 519 U. S. 347 (1997). Here, the QTA, by providing that the statute of limitations will not begin to run until
the plaintiff "knew or should have known of the claim of the
United States," has already effectively allowed for equitable
tolling. See Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs, 498
U. S. 89, 96 (1990) ("We have allowed equitable tolling in situations where the claimant has actively pursued his judicial
remedies by filing a defective pleading during the statutory
period, or where the complainant has been induced or tricked
by his adversary's misconduct into allowing the filing deadline to pass"). Given this fact, and the unusually generous

Stevens, J., concurring
nature of the QTA's limitations time period, extension of thestatutory period by additional equitable tolling would be unwarranted. This is particularly true given that the QTAdeals with ownership of land. It is of special importance
that landowners know with certainty what their rights are,
and the period during which those rights may be subject tochallenge. Equitable tolling of the already generous statute

of limitations incorporated in the QTA would throw a cloudof uncertainty over these rights, and we hold that it is incompatible with the Act.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedingsconsistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.
Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Souter joins,
concurring.

As the Court correctly observes, the text of the Quiet Title
Act, 28 U. S. C. $ 2409a(g), expressly allows equitable tollingby providing that the statute of limitations will not begin to

run until the plaintiff or the plaintiff 's predecessor "knew orshould have known of the claim of the United States." Because the Beggerlys were aware of the Government's claimmore than 12 years before they filed this action, the Court
correctly holds that there is no basis for any additional equi-table tolling in this case. We are not confronted with the
question whether a doctrine such as fraudulent concealment
or equitable estoppel might apply if the Government wereguilty of outrageous misconduct that prevented the plaintiff,

though fully aware of the Government's claim of title, from
knowing of her own claim. Those doctrines are distinct
from equitable tolling, see 4 C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal
Practice and Procedure $ 1056 (Supp. 1998); cf. United States
v. Locke, 471 U. S. 84, 94, n. 10 (1985) (referring separately
to estoppel and equitable tolling), and conceivably might

quite different type of case. Accordingly, I join the Court'sopinion without reservation.

UNITED STATES v. BESTFOODS et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe sixth circuit

No. 97-454. Argued March 24, 1998--Decided June 8, 1998
The United States brought this action under $ 107(a)(2) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980
(CERCLA) against, among others, respondent CPC International Inc.,
the parent corporation of the defunct Ott Chemical Co. (Ott II), for the
costs of cleaning up industrial waste generated by Ott II's chemical
plant. Section 107(a)(2) authorizes suits against, among others, "any
person who at the time of disposal of any hazardous substance owned or
operated any facility." The trial focused on whether CPC, as a parent
corporation, had "owned or operated" Ott II's plant within the meaning
of $ 107(a)(2). The District Court said that operator liability may attach
to a parent corporation both indirectly, when the corporate veil can be
pierced under state law, and directly, when the parent has exerted
power or influence over its subsidiary by actively participating in, and
exercising control over, the subsidiary's business during a period of hazardous waste disposal. Applying that test, the court held CPC liable
because CPC had selected Ott II's board of directors and populated its
executive ranks with CPC officials, and another CPC official had played
a significant role in shaping Ott II's environmental compliance policy.
The Sixth Circuit reversed. Although recognizing that a parent company might be held directly liable under $ 107(a)(2) if it actually operated
its subsidiary's facility in the stead of the subsidiary, or alongside of it
as a joint venturer, that court refused to go further. Rejecting the
District Court's analysis, the Sixth Circuit explained that a parent corporation's liability for operating a facility ostensibly operated by its subsidiary depends on whether the degree to which the parent controls the
subsidiary and the extent and manner of its involvement with the facility amount to the abuse of the corporate form that will warrant piercing
the corporate veil and disregarding the separate corporate entities of
the parent and subsidiary. Applying Michigan veil-piercing law, the
court decided that CPC was not liable for controlling Ott II's actions,
since the two corporations maintained separate personalities and CPC
did not utilize the subsidiary form to perpetrate fraud or subvert justice.

Held:

1. When (but only when) the corporate veil may be pierced, a parent
corporation may be charged with derivative CERCLA liability for its

52 UNITED STATES v. BESTFOODS

Syllabus
subsidiary's actions in operating a polluting facility. It is a general
principle of corporate law that a parent corporation (so-called because
of control through ownership of another corporation's stock) is not liable
for the acts of its subsidiaries. CERCLA does not purport to reject
this bedrock principle, and the Government has indeed made no claim
that a corporate parent is liable as an owner or an operator under

$ 107(a)(2) simply because its subsidiary owns or operates a polluting
facility. But there is an equally fundamental principle of corporate law,
applicable to the parent-subsidiary relationship as well as generally, that
the corporate veil may be pierced and the shareholder held liable for
the corporation's conduct when, inter alia, the corporate form would
otherwise be misused to accomplish certain wrongful purposes, most
notably fraud, on the shareholder's behalf. CERCLA does not purport
to rewrite this well-settled rule, either, and against this venerable
common-law backdrop, the congressional silence is audible. Cf. Edmonds v. Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, 443 U. S. 256, 266-267.
CERCLA's failure to speak to a matter as fundamental as the liability
implications of corporate ownership demands application of the rule
that, to abrogate a common-law principle, a statute must speak directly
to the question addressed by the common law. United States v. Texas,
507 U. S. 529, 534. Pp. 61-64.

2. A corporate parent that actively participated in, and exercised control over, the operations of its subsidiary's facility may be held directly
liable in its own right under $ 107(a)(2) as an operator of the facility.
Pp. 64-73.

(a) Derivative liability aside, CERCLA does not bar a parent corporation from direct liability for its own actions. Under the plain language of $ 107(a)(2), any person who operates a polluting facility is directly liable for the costs of cleaning up the pollution, and this is so even
if that person is the parent corporation of the facility's owner. Because
the statute does not define the term "operate," however, it is difficult to
define actions sufficient to constitute direct parental "operation." In
the organizational sense obviously intended by CERCLA, to "operate"
a facility ordinarily means to direct the workings of, manage, or conduct
the affairs of the facility. To sharpen the definition for purposes of
CERCLA's concern with environmental contamination, an operator
must manage, direct, or conduct operations specifically related to the
leakage or disposal of hazardous waste, or decisions about compliance
with environmental regulations. Pp. 64-67.

(b) The Sixth Circuit correctly rejected the direct liability analysis
of the District Court, which mistakenly focused on the relationship between parent and subsidiary, and premised liability on little more than
CPC's ownership of Ott II and its majority control over Ott II's board

Syllabus
of directors. Because direct liability for the parent's operation of the
facility must be kept distinct from derivative liability for the subsidiary's operation of the facility, the analysis should instead have focused
on the relationship between CPC and the facility itself, i. e., on whether
CPC "operated" the facility, as evidenced by its direct participation in
the facility's activities. That error was compounded by the District
Court's erroneous assumption that actions of the joint officers and directors were necessarily attributable to CPC, rather than Ott II, contrary
to time-honored common-law principles. The District Court's focus on
the relationship between parent and subsidiary (rather than parent and
facility), combined with its automatic attribution of the actions of dual
officers and directors to CPC, erroneously, even if unintentionally,
treated CERCLA as though it displaced or fundamentally altered
common-law standards of limited liability. The District Court's analysis created what is in essence a relaxed, CERCLA-specific rule of derivative liability that would banish traditional standards and expectations
from the law of CERCLA liability. Such a rule does not arise from
congressional silence, and CERCLA's silence is dispositive. Pp. 67-70.

(c) Nonetheless, the Sixth Circuit erred in limiting direct liability
under CERCLA to a parent's sole or joint venture operation, so as to
eliminate any possible finding that CPC is liable as an operator on the
facts of this case. The ordinary meaning of the word "operate" in the
organizational sense is not limited to those two parental actions, but
extends also to situations in which, e. g., joint officers or directors conduct the affairs of the facility on behalf of the parent, or agents of the
parent with no position in the subsidiary manage or direct activities at
the subsidiary's facility. Norms of corporate behavior (undisturbed by
any CERCLA provision) are crucial reference points, both for determining whether a dual officer or director has served the parent in conducting operations at the facility, and for distinguishing a parental officer's
oversight of a subsidiary from his control over the operation of the subsidiary's facility. There is, in fact, some evidence that an agent of CPC
alone engaged in activities at Ott II's plant that were eccentric under
accepted norms of parental oversight of a subsidiary's facility: The District Court's opinion speaks of such an agent who played a conspicuous
part in dealing with the toxic risks emanating from the plant's operation.
The findings in this regard are enough to raise an issue of CPC's operation of the facility, though this Court draws no ultimate conclusion, leaving the issue for the lower courts to reevaluate and resolve in the first
instance. Pp. 70-73.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court.
The United States brought this action for the costs ofcleaning up industrial waste generated by a chemical plant.

The issue before us, under the Comprehensive Environmen-tal Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980
(CERCLA), 94 Stat. 2767, as amended, 42 U. S. C. $ 9601 et
seq., is whether a parent corporation that actively partici-pated in, and exercised control over, the operations of a subsidiary may, without more, be held liable as an operator of apolluting facility owned or operated by the subsidiary. We
answer no, unless the corporate veil may be pierced. But acorporate parent that actively participated in, and exercised
control over, the operations of the facility itself may be helddirectly liable in its own right as an operator of the facility.

In 1980, CERCLA was enacted in response to the seriousenvironmental and health risks posed by industrial pollution.

No. 96-848, p. 13 (1980).1 The term "person" is defined in
CERCLA to include corporations and other business organizations, see 42 U. S. C. $ 9601(21), and the term "facility" enjoys a broad and detailed definition as well, see $ 9601(9).2
The phrase "owner or operator" is defined only by tautology,

In 1957, Ott Chemical Co. (Ott I) began manufacturing
chemicals at a plant near Muskegon, Michigan, and its intentional and unintentional dumping of hazardous substances
significantly polluted the soil and ground water at the site.
In 1965, respondent CPC International Inc.3 incorporated a
wholly owned subsidiary to buy Ott I's assets in exchange
for CPC stock. The new company, also dubbed Ott Chemical Co. (Ott II), continued chemical manufacturing at the site,
and continued to pollute its surroundings. CPC kept the

managers of Ott I, including its founder, president, and prin-cipal shareholder, Arnold Ott, on board as officers of Ott II.

Arnold Ott and several other Ott II officers and directorswere also given positions at CPC, and they performed duties
for both corporations.In 1972, CPC sold Ott II to Story Chemical Company,
which operated the Muskegon plant until its bankruptcy in1977. Shortly thereafter, when respondent Michigan Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) 4 examined the sitefor environmental damage, it found the land littered with
thousands of leaking and even exploding drums of waste,and the soil and water saturated with noxious chemicals.
MDNR sought a buyer for the property who would be will-ing to contribute toward its cleanup, and after extensive negotiations, respondent Aerojet-General Corp. arranged fortransfer of the site from the Story bankruptcy trustee in
1977. Aerojet created a wholly owned California subsidiary,Cordova Chemical Company (Cordova/California), to purchase the property, and Cordova/California in turn createda wholly owned Michigan subsidiary, Cordova Chemical
Company of Michigan (Cordova/Michigan), which manufac-tured chemicals at the site until 1986.

By 1981, the federal Environmental Protection Agencyhad undertaken to see the site cleaned up, and its long-term

remedial plan called for expenditures well into the tens ofmillions of dollars. To recover some of that money, the

Cordova/California agreed to undertake certain cleanup actions, and
MDNR agreed to share in the funding of those actions and to indemnify
Cordova/California for various expenses. The Michigan Court of Appeals
has held that this agreement requires MDNR to indemnify Aerojet and
its Cordova subsidiaries for any CERCLA liability that they may incur in
connection with their activities at the Muskegon facility. See Cordova

58 UNITED STATES v. BESTFOODS

Opinion of the Court
United States filed this action under $ 107 in 1989, nam-ing five defendants as responsible parties: CPC, Aerojet,

Cordova/California, Cordova/Michigan, and Arnold Ott.6(By that time, Ott I and Ott II were defunct.) After the
parties (and MDNR) had launched a flurry of contributionclaims, counterclaims, and cross-claims, the District Court
consolidated the cases for trial in three phases: liability, rem-edy, and insurance coverage. So far, only the first phase has
been completed; in 1991, the District Court held a 15-daybench trial on the issue of liability. Because the parties stipulated that the Muskegon plant was a "facility" within themeaning of 42 U. S. C. $ 9601(9), that hazardous substances
had been released at the facility, and that the United Stateshad incurred reimbursable response costs to clean up the
site, the trial focused on the issues of whether CPC andAerojet, as the parent corporations of Ott II and the Cordova
companies, had "owned or operated" the facility within themeaning of $ 107(a)(2).

The District Court said that operator liability may attachto a parent corporation both directly, when the parent itself
operates the facility, and indirectly, when the corporate veilcan be pierced under state law. See

CPC Int'l, Inc. v.Aerojet-General Corp., 777 F. Supp. 549, 572 (WD Mich.

1991). The court explained that, while CERCLA imposesdirect liability in situations in which the corporate veil cannot be pierced under traditional concepts of corporate law,"the statute and its legislative history do not suggest that
CERCLA rejects entirely the crucial limits to liability thatare inherent to corporate law."

Id., at 573. As the DistrictCourt put it:

"a parent corporation is directly liable under section107(a)(2) as an operator only when it has exerted power
or influence over its subsidiary by actively participatingin and exercising control over the subsidiary's business

6 Arnold Ott settled out of court with the Government on the eve of trial.

Opinion of the Court
during a period of disposal of hazardous waste. A par-ent's actual participation in and control over a subsidiary's functions and decision-making creates `operator'liability under CERCLA; a parent's mere oversight of a
subsidiary's business in a manner appropriate and consistent with the investment relationship between a par-ent and its wholly owned subsidiary does not."

Ibid.

Applying that test to the facts of this case, the District Court
held both CPC and Aerojet liable under $ 107(a)(2) as opera-tors. As to CPC, the court found it particularly telling that

CPC selected Ott II's board of directors and populated its
executive ranks with CPC officials, and that a CPC official,G. R. D. Williams, played a significant role in shaping Ott II's

environmental compliance policy.After a divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth
Circuit reversed in part, United States v. Cordova/Michigan,59 F. 3d 584, that court granted rehearing en banc and
vacated the panel decision, 67 F. 3d 586 (1995). This time,7 judges to 6, the court again reversed the District Court
in part. 113 F. 3d 572 (1997). The majority remarked on
the possibility that a parent company might be held directlyliable as an operator of a facility owned by its subsidiary:

"At least conceivably, a parent might independently oper-ate the facility in the stead of its subsidiary; or, as a sort
of joint venturer, actually operate the facility alongside itssubsidiary."

Id., at 579. But the court refused to go any
further and rejected the District Court's analysis with theexplanation:

"[W]here a parent corporation is sought to be held liable as an operator pursuant to 42 U. S. C. $ 9607(a)(2)
based upon the extent of its control of its subsidiary
which owns the facility, the parent will be liable only
when the requirements necessary to pierce the corporate veil [under state law] are met. In other words, . . .
whether the parent will be liable as an operator depends

Opinion of the Court
upon whether the degree to which it controls its subsid-iary and the extent and manner of its involvement with

the facility, amount to the abuse of the corporate formthat will warrant piercing the corporate veil and disregarding the separate corporate entities of the parent andsubsidiary."

Id., at 580.

Applying Michigan veil-piercing law, the Court of Appealsdecided that neither CPC nor Aerojet

7 was liable for controlling the actions of its subsidiaries, since the parent and sub-sidiary corporations maintained separate personalities and

the parents did not utilize the subsidiary corporate form toperpetrate fraud or subvert justice.

We granted certiorari, 522 U. S. 1024 (1997), to resolve aconflict among the Circuits over the extent to which parent
corporations may be held liable under CERCLA for operat-ing facilities ostensibly under the control of their subsidiaries.8 We now vacate and remand.

7 Unlike CPC, Aerojet does not base its defense in this Court on a claim
that, absent unusual circumstances, a parent company can be held liable
as an operator of a facility only by piercing the corporate veil. Rather,
Aerojet denies liability by claiming that (1) neither it nor its subsidiaries
disposed of hazardous substances during their operation of the facility, see
Brief for Respondents Aerojet-General Corp. et al. 27-36, and (2) it is
entitled to a third-party defense under $ 107(b)(3) of CERCLA, 42 U. S. C.

$ 9607(b)(3), see Brief for Respondents Aerojet-General Corp. et al. 38-46.
The Court of Appeals expressed some measure of agreement with Aerojet
on these points and instructed the District Court to consider them on
remand. See 113 F. 3d, at 577, 583. These issues are not before this
Court.

beyond the assets of the subsidiary. That `control' includesthe election of directors, the making of by-laws . . . and the

doing of all other acts incident to the legal status of stock-holders. Nor will a duplication of some or all of the directors or executive officers be fatal." Douglas 196 (footnotes
omitted). Although this respect for corporate distinctionswhen the subsidiary is a polluter has been severely criticized

in the literature, see, e. g., Note, Liability of Parent Corpora-tions for Hazardous Waste Cleanup and Damages, 99 Harv.
L. Rev. 986 (1986), nothing in CERCLA purports to rejectthis bedrock principle, and against this venerable commonlaw backdrop, the congressional silence is audible. Cf. Edmonds v. Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, 443 U. S.
256, 266-267 (1979) ("[S]ilence is most eloquent, for such reticence while contemplating an important and controversial
change in existing law is unlikely"). The Government has
indeed made no claim that a corporate parent is liable as an
owner or an operator under $ 107 simply because its subsidiary is subject to liability for owning or operating a polluting facility.

But there is an equally fundamental principle of corporate
law, applicable to the parent-subsidiary relationship as well
as generally, that the corporate veil may be pierced and the
shareholder held liable for the corporation's conduct when,
inter alia, the corporate form would otherwise be misused
to accomplish certain wrongful purposes, most notably fraud,
on the shareholder's behalf. See, e. g., Anderson v. Abbott,
supra, at 362 ("[T]here are occasions when the limited liability sought to be obtained through the corporation will be
qualified or denied"); Chicago, M. & St. P. R. Co. v. Minneapolis Civic and Commerce Assn., 247 U. S. 490, 501 (1918)

$$ 6.01-6.06 (1987 and 1996 Supp.) (discussing the law of veilpiercing in the parent-subsidiary context). Nothing in
CERCLA purports to rewrite this well-settled rule, either.CERCLA is thus like many another congressional enactment
in giving no indication that "the entire corpus of state corpo-ration law is to be replaced simply because a plaintiff 's cause
of action is based upon a federal statute," Burks v. Lasker,441 U. S. 471, 478 (1979), and the failure of the statute to
speak to a matter as fundamental as the liability implicationsof corporate ownership demands application of the rule that
"[i]n order to abrogate a common-law principle, the statutemust speak directly to the question addressed by the common law," United States v. Texas, 507 U. S. 529, 534 (1993)(internal quotation marks omitted). The Court of Appeals
was accordingly correct in holding that when (but only when)the corporate veil may be pierced,

9 may a parent corporation

9 There is significant disagreement among courts and commentators over
whether, in enforcing CERCLA's indirect liability, courts should borrow
state law, or instead apply a federal common law of veil piercing. Compare, e. g., 113 F. 3d, at 584-585 (Merritt, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (arguing that federal common law should apply), LansfordCoaldale Joint Water Auth. v. Tonolli Corp., 4 F. 3d, at 1225 ("[G]iven the
federal interest in uniformity in the application of CERCLA, it is federal
common law, and not state law, which governs when corporate veilpiercing is justified under CERCLA"), and Aronovsky & Fuller, Liability of Parent Corporations for Hazardous Substance Releases under
CERCLA, 24 U. S. F. L. Rev. 421, 455 (1990) ("CERCLA enforcement
should not be hampered by subordination of its goals to varying state law

IV

A
If the Act rested liability entirely on ownership of a pollut-ing facility, this opinion might end here; but CERCLA liability may turn on operation as well as ownership, and nothingin the statute's terms bars a parent corporation from direct
liability for its own actions in operating a facility owned byits subsidiary. As Justice (then-Professor) Douglas noted almost 70 years ago, derivative liability cases are to be distin-guished from those in which "the alleged wrong can seemingly be traced to the parent through the conduit of its ownpersonnel and management" and "the parent is directly a
participant in the wrong complained of." Douglas 207, 208.11
(Mass. 1987) (noting that, since "federal common law draws upon state law
for guidance, . . . the choice between state and federal [veil-piercing law]
may in many cases present questions of academic interest, but little practical significance"). But cf. Note, Piercing the Corporate Law Veil: The
Alter Ego Doctrine Under Federal Common Law, 95 Harv. L. Rev. 853
(1982) (arguing that federal common law need not mirror state law, because "federal common law should look to federal statutory policy rather
than to state corporate law when deciding whether to pierce the corporate
veil"). Since none of the parties challenges the Sixth Circuit's holding
that CPC and Aerojet incurred no derivative liability, the question is not
presented in this case, and we do not address it further.

10 Some courts and commentators have suggested that this indirect,

veil-piercing approach can subject a parent corporation to liability only as
an owner, and not as an operator. See, e. g., Lansford-Coaldale Joint
Water Auth. v. Tonolli Corp., supra, at 1220; Oswald, Bifurcation of the
Owner and Operator Analysis under CERCLA, 72 Wash. U. L. Q. 223, 281-
282 (1994) (hereinafter Oswald). We think it is otherwise, however. If
a subsidiary that operates, but does not own, a facility is so pervasively
controlled by its parent for a sufficiently improper purpose to warrant veil
piercing, the parent may be held derivatively liable for the subsidiary's
acts as an operator.

Opinion of the Court
In such instances, the parent is directly liable for its ownactions. See H. Henn & J. Alexander, Laws of Corporations

347 (3d ed. 1983) (hereinafter Henn & Alexander) ("Apartfrom corporation law principles, a shareholder, whether a
natural person or a corporation, may be liable on the ground
that such shareholder's activity resulted in the liability").The fact that a corporate subsidiary happens to own a polluting facility operated by its parent does nothing, then, to dis-place the rule that the parent "corporation is [itself] responsible for the wrongs committed by its agents in the course ofits business,"

Mine Workers v. Coronado Coal Co., 259 U. S.
344, 395 (1922), and whereas the rules of veil piercing limit
derivative liability for the actions of another corporation,
CERCLA's "operator" provision is concerned primarily with
direct liability for one's own actions. See, e. g., Sidney
S. Arst Co. v. Pipefitters Welfare Ed. Fund, 25 F. 3d 417,
420 (CA7 1994) ("[T]he direct, personal liability provided by
CERCLA is distinct from the derivative liability that results
from piercing the corporate veil" (internal quotation marks
omitted)). It is this direct liability that is properly seen as
being at issue here.

Under the plain language of the statute, any person who
operates a polluting facility is directly liable for the costs of
cleaning up the pollution. See 42 U. S. C. $ 9607(a)(2). This
is so regardless of whether that person is the facility's owner,
the owner's parent corporation or business partner, or even
a saboteur who sneaks into the facility at night to discharge
its poisons out of malice. If any such act of operating a corporate subsidiary's facility is done on behalf of a parent corporation, the existence of the parent-subsidiary relationship
under state corporate law is simply irrelevant to the issue
of direct liability. See Riverside Market Dev. Corp. v. International Bldg. Prods., Inc., 931 F. 2d 327, 330 (CA5)
("CERCLA prevents individuals from hiding behind the corporate shield when, as `operators,' they themselves actually
participate in the wrongful conduct prohibited by the Act"),

cert. denied, 502 U. S. 1004 (1991); United States v. KayserRoth Corp., 910 F. 2d 24, 26 (CA1 1990) ("[A] person who is
an operator of a facility is not protected from liability by the
legal structure of ownership").12

This much is easy to say: the difficulty comes in defining
actions sufficient to constitute direct parental "operation."
Here of course we may again rue the uselessness of
CERCLA's definition of a facility's "operator" as "any person
. . . operating" the facility, 42 U. S. C. $ 9601(20)(A)(ii), which
leaves us to do the best we can to give the term its "ordinary
or natural meaning." Bailey v. United States, 516 U. S. 137,
145 (1995) (internal quotation marks omitted). In a mechanical sense, to "operate" ordinarily means "[t]o control the
functioning of; run: operate a sewing machine." American
Heritage Dictionary 1268 (3d ed. 1992); see also Webster's
New International Dictionary 1707 (2d ed. 1958) ("to work;
as, to operate a machine"). And in the organizational sense
more obviously intended by CERCLA, the word ordinarily
means "[t]o conduct the affairs of; manage: operate a business." American Heritage Dictionary, supra, at 1268; see
also Webster's New International Dictionary, supra, at 1707
("to manage"). So, under CERCLA, an operator is simply
someone who directs the workings of, manages, or conducts
the affairs of a facility. To sharpen the definition for purposes of CERCLA's concern with environmental contamination, an operator must manage, direct, or conduct operations
specifically related to pollution, that is, operations having

12 See Oswald 257 ("There are . . . instances . . . in which the parent
has not sufficiently overstepped the bounds of corporate separateness to
warrant piercing, yet is involved enough in the facility's activities that it
should be held liable as an operator. Imagine, for example, a parent who
strictly observed corporate formalities, avoided intertwining officers and
directors, and adequately capitalized its subsidiary, yet provided active,
daily supervision and control over hazardous waste disposal activities of
the subsidiary. Such a parent should not escape liability just because its
activities do not justify a piercing of the subsidiary's veil").

to do with the leakage or disposal of hazardous waste, ordecisions about compliance with environmental regulations.

B
With this understanding, we are satisfied that the Courtof Appeals correctly rejected the District Court's analysis of

direct liability. But we also think that the appeals courterred in limiting direct liability under the statute to a parent's sole or joint venture operation, so as to eliminate anypossible finding that CPC is liable as an operator on the facts
of this case. 1

By emphasizing that "CPC is directly liable under section107(a)(2) as an operator because CPC actively participated
in and exerted significant control over Ott II's business anddecision-making," 777 F. Supp., at 574, the District Court
applied the "actual control" test of whether the parent "actu-ally operated the business of its subsidiary," id., at 573, as
several Circuits have employed it, see, e. g., United States v.Kayser-Roth Corp., supra, at 27 (operator liability "requires
active involvement in the affairs of the subsidiary"); Jackson-ville Elec. Auth. v. Bernuth Corp., 996 F. 2d 1107, 1110
(CA11 1993) (parent is liable if it "actually exercised controlover, or was otherwise intimately involved in the operations
of, the [subsidiary] corporation immediately responsible forthe operation of the facility" (internal quotation marks
omitted)).The well-taken objection to the actual control test, however, is its fusion of direct and indirect liability; the test isadministered by asking a question about the relationship between the two corporations (an issue going to indirect liabil-ity) instead of a question about the parent's interaction with
the subsidiary's facility (the source of any direct liability).If, however, direct liability for the parent's operation of the
facility is to be kept distinct from derivative liability for thesubsidiary's own operation, the focus of the enquiry must

524US1 Unit: $U74 [09-06-00 17:54:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN
68 UNITED STATES v. BESTFOODS

Opinion of the Court
necessarily be different under the two tests. "The questionis not whether the parent operates the subsidiary, but rather

whether it operates the facility, and that operation is evi-denced by participation in the activities of the facility, not
the subsidiary. Control of the subsidiary, if extensive
enough, gives rise to indirect liability under piercing doc-trine, not direct liability under the statutory language." Oswald 269; see also Schiavone v. Pearce, 79 F. 3d 248, 254(CA2 1996) ("Any liabilities [the parent] may have as an

operator, then, stem directly from its control over the plant").The District Court was therefore mistaken to rest its analysis on CPC's relationship with Ott II, premising liability on
little more than "CPC's 100-percent ownership of Ott II" and
"CPC's active participation in, and at times majority control
over, Ott II's board of directors." 777 F. Supp., at 575. The
analysis should instead have rested on the relationship between CPC and the Muskegon facility itself.

In addition to (and perhaps as a reflection of) the erroneous focus on the relationship between CPC and Ott II, even
those findings of the District Court that might be taken to
speak to the extent of CPC's activity at the facility itself
are flawed, for the District Court wrongly assumed that the
actions of the joint officers and directors are necessarily attributable to CPC. The District Court emphasized the facts
that CPC placed its own high-level officials on Ott II's board
of directors and in key management positions at Ott II, and
that those individuals made major policy decisions and conducted day-to-day operations at the facility: "Although Ott
II corporate officers set the day-to-day operating policies for
the company without any need to obtain formal approval
from CPC, CPC actively participated in this decision-making
because high-ranking CPC officers served in Ott II management positions." Id., at 559; see also id., at 575 (relying on
"CPC's involvement in major decision-making and day-today operations through CPC officials who served within Ott
II management, including the positions of president and chief

also actively participated in and exerted control over day-to-day decision-making at Ott II through representation in

the highest levels of the subsidiary's management").In imposing direct liability on these grounds, the District
Court failed to recognize that "it is entirely appropriate fordirectors of a parent corporation to serve as directors of its
subsidiary, and that fact alone may not serve to expose the
parent corporation to liability for its subsidiary's acts."
American Protein Corp. v. AB Volvo, 844 F. 2d 56, 57 (CA2),

Dock Co. v. Lake Champlain Transp. Co., 31 F. 2d 265, 267

shares does not fuse the corporations, even when the directors are common to each"); Henn & Alexander 355 (noting
that it is "normal" for a parent and subsidiary to "have identical directors and officers").

This recognition that the corporate personalities remain
distinct has its corollary in the "well established principle [of
corporate law] that directors and officers holding positions
with a parent and its subsidiary can and do `change hats'
to represent the two corporations separately, despite their
common ownership." Lusk v. Foxmeyer Health Corp., 129

Opinion of the Court
here that dual officers and directors made policy decisionsand supervised activities at the facility. The Government

would have to show that, despite the general presumption tothe contrary, the officers and directors were acting in their
capacities as CPC officers and directors, and not as Ott IIofficers and directors, when they committed those acts.

13

The District Court made no such enquiry here, however, dis-regarding entirely this time-honored common-law rule.

In sum, the District Court's focus on the relationship be-tween parent and subsidiary (rather than parent and facility), combined with its automatic attribution of the actionsof dual officers and directors to the corporate parent, erroneously, even if unintentionally, treated CERCLA as though itdisplaced or fundamentally altered common-law standards of
limited liability. Indeed, if the evidence of common corpo-rate personnel acting at management and directorial levels
were enough to support a finding of a parent corporation'sdirect operator liability under CERCLA, then the possibility
of resort to veil piercing to establish indirect, derivative lia-bility for the subsidiary's violations would be academic.
There would in essence be a relaxed, CERCLA-specific ruleof derivative liability that would banish traditional standards
and expectations from the law of CERCLA liability. But,as we have said, such a rule does not arise from congressional silence, and CERCLA's silence is dispositive.

2
We accordingly agree with the Court of Appeals that aparticipation-and-control test looking to the parent's supervi13 We do not attempt to recite the ways in which the Government could
show that dual officers or directors were in fact acting on behalf of the
parent. Here, it is prudent to say only that the presumption that an act
is taken on behalf of the corporation for whom the officer claims to act is
strongest when the act is perfectly consistent with the norms of corporate
behavior, but wanes as the distance from those accepted norms approaches
the point of action by a dual officer plainly contrary to the interests of the
subsidiary yet nonetheless advantageous to the parent.

Opinion of the Court
sion over the subsidiary, especially one that assumes thatdual officers always act on behalf of the parent, cannot be

used to identify operation of a facility resulting in direct pa-rental liability. Nonetheless, a return to the ordinary meaning of the word "operate" in the organizational sense will
indicate why we think that the Sixth Circuit stopped shortwhen it confined its examples of direct parental operation to

exclusive or joint ventures, and declined to find at least thepossibility of direct operation by CPC in this case.

In our enquiry into the meaning Congress presumably hadin mind when it used the verb "to operate," we recognized
that the statute obviously meant something more than mere
mechanical activation of pumps and valves, and must be read
to contemplate "operation" as including the exercise of direction over the facility's activities. See supra, at 66-67. The
Court of Appeals recognized this by indicating that a parent
can be held directly liable when the parent operates the facility in the stead of its subsidiary or alongside the subsidiary
in some sort of a joint venture. See 113 F. 3d, at 579. We
anticipated a further possibility above, however, when we
observed that a dual officer or director might depart so far
from the norms of parental influence exercised through dual
officeholding as to serve the parent, even when ostensibly
acting on behalf of the subsidiary in operating the facility.
See n. 13, supra. Yet another possibility, suggested by the
facts of this case, is that an agent of the parent with no hat
to wear but the parent's hat might manage or direct activities at the facility.

Identifying such an occurrence calls for line-drawing yet
again, since the acts of direct operation that give rise to parental liability must necessarily be distinguished from the
interference that stems from the normal relationship between parent and subsidiary. Again norms of corporate behavior (undisturbed by any CERCLA provision) are crucial
reference points. Just as we may look to such norms in
identifying the limits of the presumption that a dual office524US1 Unit: $U74 [09-06-00 17:54:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN
72 UNITED STATES v. BESTFOODS

Opinion of the Court
holder acts in his ostensible capacity, so here we may referto them in distinguishing a parental officer's oversight of a

subsidiary from such an officer's control over the operationof the subsidiary's facility. "[A]ctivities that involve the facility but which are consistent with the parent's investor
status, such as monitoring of the subsidiary's performance,supervision of the subsidiary's finance and capital budget decisions, and articulation of general policies and procedures,should not give rise to direct liability." Oswald 282. The
critical question is whether, in degree and detail, actions di-rected to the facility by an agent of the parent alone are
eccentric under accepted norms of parental oversight of a
subsidiary's facility.

There is, in fact, some evidence that CPC engaged in just
this type and degree of activity at the Muskegon plant. The
District Court's opinion speaks of an agent of CPC alone who
played a conspicuous part in dealing with the toxic risks emanating from the operation of the plant. G. R. D. Williams
worked only for CPC; he was not an employee, officer, or
director of Ott II, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 7, and thus, his actions
were of necessity taken only on behalf of CPC. The District
Court found that "CPC became directly involved in environmental and regulatory matters through the work of . . . Williams, CPC's governmental and environmental affairs director. Williams . . . became heavily involved in environmental
issues at Ott II." 777 F. Supp., at 561. He "actively participated in and exerted control over a variety of Ott II environmental matters," ibid., and he "issued directives regarding
Ott II's responses to regulatory inquiries," id., at 575.

We think that these findings are enough to raise an issue
of CPC's operation of the facility through Williams's actions,
though we would draw no ultimate conclusion from these
findings at this point. Not only would we be deciding in the
first instance an issue on which the trial and appellate courts
did not focus, but the very fact that the District Court did
not see the case as we do suggests that there may be still

Opinion of the Court
more to be known about Williams's activities. Indeed, evenas the factual findings stand, the trial court offered little in

the way of concrete detail for its conclusions about Williams'srole in Ott II's environmental affairs, and the parties vigorously dispute the extent of Williams's involvement. Pru-dence thus counsels us to remand, on the theory of direct
operation set out here, for reevaluation of Williams's role,and of the role of any other CPC agent who might be said to
have had a part in operating the Muskegon facility.14

V
The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuitis vacated, and the case is remanded with instructions to

return it to the District Court for further proceedings con-sistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

14 There are some passages in the District Court's opinion that might
suggest that, without reference to Williams, some of Ott II's actions in
operating the facility were in fact dictated by, and thus taken on behalf
of, CPC. See, e. g., 777 F. Supp., at 561 ("CPC officials engaged in . . .
missions to Ott II in which Ott II officials received instructions on how to
improve and change"); id., at 559 ("CPC executives who were not Ott II
board members also occasionally attended Ott II board meetings"). But
nothing in the District Court's findings of fact, as written, even comes
close to overcoming the presumption that Ott II officials made their decisions and performed their acts as agents of Ott II. Indeed, the finding
that "Ott II corporate officers set the day-to-day operating policies for the
company without any need to obtain formal approval from CPC," ibid.,
indicates just the opposite. Still, the Government is, of course, free on
remand to point to any additional evidence, not cited by the District Court,
that would tend to establish that Ott II's decisionmakers acted on specific
orders from CPC.

GEISSAL, beneficiary and representative of the

ESTATE OF GEISSAL, DECEASED v. MOORE

MEDICAL CORP. et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eighth circuit

No. 97-689. Argued April 29, 1998--Decided June 8, 1998
The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA)

amended the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
(ERISA) to permit a beneficiary of an employer's group health plan to
elect continuing coverage when he might otherwise lose that benefit
because of a "qualifying event," such as the termination of employment.
When respondent Moore Medical Corporation fired James Geissal, it told
him that COBRA gave him the right to elect continuing coverage under
Moore's health plan. He so elected, but six months later, Moore told
him that he was not entitled to COBRA benefits because on his date of
election he was already covered by a group plan through his wife's employer, Trans World Airlines (TWA). Geissal filed suit against respondents (collectively, Moore), claiming, inter alia, that Moore was violating
COBRA by renouncing an obligation to provide continuing coverage.
He died while this suit was pending, and his wife replaced him as plaintiff. The Magistrate granted partial summary judgment to Moore, concluding that an employee with coverage under another group health plan
on the date he elects COBRA coverage is ineligible for COBRA coverage under 29 U. S. C. $ 1162(2)(D)(i), which allows an employer to cancel
such coverage as of "[t]he date on which the qualified beneficiary first
becomes, after the date of the election . . . covered under any other
group health plan." The Eighth Circuit affirmed.

Held: An employer may not deny COBRA continuation coverage under

its health plan to an otherwise eligible beneficiary because he is covered
under another group health plan at the time he elects COBRA coverage. Pp. 79-87.

(a) Section 1162(2)(D)(i) speaks in terms of "becom[ing] covered," an
event that is significant only if it "first" occurs "after the date of the
election." Because James Geissal was a beneficiary of the TWA plan
before he elected COBRA coverage, he did not "first become" covered
under the TWA plan after the date of election, and Moore could not cut

75Cite as: 524 U. S. 74 (1998)
Syllabus
off his COBRA coverage under $ 1162(2)(D)(i)'s plain meaning. Moore's
contrary reading--that, for a beneficiary covered under a pre-existing
plan, the first moment of coverage on the day following the election is
the moment of first being covered after the date of election--ignores
the condition that the beneficiary must "first becom[e]" covered after
election, robbing the modifier "first" of any consequence, thereby equating "first becomes . . . covered" with "remains covered." Pp. 82-83.

(b) Moore argues that the plain reading should be rejected because it
would permit a beneficiary to claim continuation coverage even if he has
obtained entirely new group coverage between the qualifying event and
the election. The statute, however, is not cast expressly in terms of
preserving the status quo of the beneficiary's health care coverage as of
the date of the qualifying event. In addition, there is no reason to
assume that a beneficiary with pre-existing coverage receives a windfall
as a result of his ability to elect COBRA coverage. Since a beneficiary
must pay for whatever COBRA coverage he obtains, there is no reason
to think he will make an election for coverage he does not need. Even
Moore would permit a beneficiary with coverage under a group health
plan to elect COBRA coverage whenever there is a "significant gap"
between the coverage offered by the employer's group health plan and
that offered by the beneficiary's other group health plan. This "significant gap" approach to $ 1162(2)(D)(i) is plagued with difficulties, however, beginning with the sheer absence of any statutory support for it.
Furthermore, this approach requires courts to make policy judgments
about the adequacy of the coverage provided by the beneficiary's other
group health plan. This sort of inquiry is so far unsuitable for the
courts that this Court would expect a clear mandate before inferring
that Congress meant to foist it on the judiciary. Pp. 83-87.

76 GEISSAL v. MOORE MEDICAL CORP.

Opinion of the Court
Bradley J. Washburn argued the cause and filed a brieffor respondents.*

Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court.
The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974(ERISA), as amended by the Consolidated Omnibus Budget

Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA), authorizes a qualifiedbeneficiary of an employer's group health plan to obtain continued coverage under the plan when he might otherwise
lose that benefit for certain reasons, such as the terminationof employment. The issue in this case is whether 29 U. S. C.

$ 1162(2)(D)(i) allows an employer to deny COBRA continua-tion coverage to a qualified beneficiary who is covered under
another group health plan at the time he makes his COBRAelection. We hold that it does not.

I
On July 16, 1993, respondent Moore Medical Corporationfired James Geissal, who was suffering from cancer. While

employed, Geissal was covered under Moore's group health
plan as well as the health plan provided by his wife's employer, Trans World Airlines (TWA), through Aetna Life Insurance Company.

According to Geissal, soon after he lost his job, Moore told
him that he had a right under COBRA to elect to continue
coverage under Moore's plan. Geissal so elected, and made
the necessary premium payments for six months. On January 27, 1994, however, Moore informed Geissal it had been
mistaken: he was not actually entitled to COBRA benefits

Opinion of the Court
because on the date of his election he was already covered
by another group health plan, through his wife's employer.

Geissal then brought this suit against Moore, the Group
Benefit Plan of Moore Medical Group, Herbert Walker (an
administrator of the plan), and Sedgwick Lowndes (another
administrator) (collectively, Moore).1 Geissal charged Moore
with violating COBRA by renouncing an obligation to provide continuing health benefits coverage (Count I); he further claimed that Moore was estopped to deny him continuation coverage because it had misled him to think that he
was entitled to COBRA coverage (Count II), that Moore's
misrepresentation amounted to a waiver of any right to assert a reading of the plan provisions that would deprive him
of continuation coverage (Count III), and, finally, that Walker
had violated COBRA by failing to provide him with certain
plan documents (Count IV).

After limited discovery, Geissal moved for partial summary judgment on Counts I and II of the complaint. He
argued that Moore's reliance upon 29 U. S. C. $ 1162(2)(D)(i)
as authority to deny him COBRA continuation coverage was
misplaced. Although that subsection provides that an employer may cancel COBRA continuation coverage as of "[t]he
date on which the qualified beneficiary first becomes, after
the date of the election . . . covered under any other group
health plan (as an employee or otherwise)," Geissal was first
covered under the TWA plan before he elected COBRA
continuation coverage, not after. In any event, Geissal
maintained, Moore was estopped to deny him health benefits,
because he had detrimentally relied upon its assurances that
he was entitled to them. While the summary judgment
motion was pending, Geissal died of cancer, and petitioner
Bonnie Geissal, his wife and personal representative of his
estate, replaced him as plaintiff.

1 On November 8, 1994, the District Court granted the plaintiff's motion
to dismiss Lowndes without prejudice.

78 GEISSAL v. MOORE MEDICAL CORP.

Opinion of the Court
The Magistrate Judge hearing the case 2 first rejected
Moore's arguments that Geissal lacked standing and that
Aetna was a necessary party under Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 19(a). The Magistrate concluded that even if
Moore was correct that Geissal had no claim for compensatory damages because Aetna paid all of the medical bills,
Geissal could seek statutory damages under 29 U. S. C.

$ 1132(a)(1).3 The Magistrate held that Aetna was not a
necessary party to the suit, since complete relief could be
granted between Moore and Geissal without joining Aetna,
a verdict in Geissal's favor would not subject Moore to the
risk of inconsistent or double obligations, and Aetna's joinder
was not necessary to determine primacy as between the
two plans.

The Magistrate denied summary judgment for Geissal,
however, and instead sua sponte granted partial summary
judgment on Counts I and II in favor of Moore, concluding
that an employee with coverage under another group health

2 Pursuant to 28 U. S. C. $ 636(c), the parties agreed to have a magistrate
judge conduct all proceedings in this case.

3 This subsection provides that a beneficiary may seek relief under 29

U. S. C. $ 1132(c), which provides that a plan administrator who fails to
comply with a beneficiary's request for plan information within 30 days of
the request is personally liable to that beneficiary in the amount of up to
$100 a day from the date of the failure.

Before us, Moore suggests that Geissal lacks standing to maintain this
suit. They assert that Aetna has paid all of the medical bills, and that
the only apparent difference between the Aetna and Moore policies was a
$350 difference in their respective deductibles, a difference far exceeded
by the premiums Geissal would owe for COBRA coverage if successful.
Despite Moore's assertions to the contrary, however, nothing in the record
indicates one way or another whether Aetna has fully reimbursed Geissal
for James Geissal's medical bills. Geissal's counsel represented at oral

trip to the Greek Islands. Quite apart from this, we cannot tell from the
record whether Geissal may be entitled to recover from Moore even if
sometime later Aetna would have a claim against Geissal to recover the
insurance costs that it paid.

that James Geissal presented insufficient evidence of detri-mental reliance on Moore's representation that he was entitled to benefits under COBRA. The Magistrate also foundthat there was no significant difference between the terms
of coverage under Aetna's plan and Moore's; they differedonly in the amount of their respective deductibles, and there
was no evidence that Aetna's plan excluded or limited cover-age for James Geissal's condition.

The Magistrate then granted Geissal's unopposed motionunder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) for the entry of
final judgment on Counts I and II, and so enabled Geissalto seek immediate review of the Magistrate's decision. The
Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed, 114 F. 3d1458 (1997), and we granted certiorari, 522 U. S. 1086 (1998),
to resolve a conflict among the Circuits on whether an em-ployer may deny COBRA continuation coverage under its

under another group health plan at the time he elects cover-age under COBRA.

Opinion of the Court
utes. The amendments to ERISA require an employer 5who sponsors a group health plan to give the plan's "qualified

beneficiaries" the opportunity to elect "continuation cover-age" under the plan when the beneficiaries might otherwise
lose coverage upon the occurrence of certain "qualifyingevents," including the death of the covered employee, the
termination of the covered employee's employment (exceptin cases of gross misconduct), and divorce or legal separation
from the covered employee. 29 U. S. C. $ 1163. Thus, a"qualified beneficiary" entitled to make a COBRA election
may be a "covered employee" (someone covered by the em-ployer's plan because of his own employment), or a covered
employee's spouse or dependent child who was covered bythe plan prior to the occurrence of the "qualifying event."

$ 1167(3).COBRA demands that the continuation coverage offered
to qualified beneficiaries be identical to what the plan pro-vides to plan beneficiaries who have not suffered a qualifying
event. $ 1162(1). The statute requires plans to advise ben-eficiaries of their rights under COBRA both at the commencement of coverage and within 14 days of learning of aqualifying event,

6 $ 1166(a), after which qualified beneficiaries have 60 days to elect continuation coverage, $ 1165(1). Ifa qualified beneficiary makes a COBRA election, continuation coverage dates from the qualifying event, and when theevent is termination or reduced hours, the maximum period
of coverage is generally 18 months; in other cases, it is gener-ally 36. $ 1162(2)(A). The beneficiary who makes the election must pay for what he gets, however, up to 102 percentof the "applicable premium" for the first 18 months of continuation coverage, and up to 150 percent thereafter. $ 1162(3).

5 Employers with fewer than 20 employees are exempt from COBRA's
requirements. 29 U. S. C. $ 1161(b).

6 Under $ 1166(a)(2), an employer has a duty to report most qualifying

events, including the termination of employment, to its group health plan
administrator within 30 days of the qualifying event.

Opinion of the Court
The "applicable premium" is usually the cost to the plan ofproviding continuation coverage, regardless of who usually

pays for the insurance benefit. $ 1164. Benefits may ceaseif the qualified beneficiary fails to pay the premiums,

$ 1162(2)(C), and an employer may terminate it for certainother reasons, such as discontinuance of the group health
plan entirely, $ 1162(2)(B). COBRA coverage may alsocease on

"[t]he date on which the qualified beneficiary first be-comes, after the date of the election--

"(i) covered under any other group health plan (asan employee or otherwise), which does not contain any
exclusion or limitation with respect to any preexistingcondition of such beneficiary, or

"(ii) entitled to benefits under title XVIII of theSocial Security Act." $ 1162(2)(D).

7 When originally enacted, $ 1162(2)(D)(i) provided that coverage could
cease when a qualified beneficiary "first becomes, after the date of the
election . . . a covered employee under any other group health plan," and
a separate provision, $ 1162(E), provided that in the case of an individual
who was a qualified beneficiary as the result of being a spouse of a covered
employee, coverage could cease on "the date on which the beneficiary remarries and becomes covered under a group health plan." COBRA, Pub.
L. 99-272, 100 Stat. 228. Congress later struck $ 1162(E) and amended
subsection (i) to provide that coverage could cease when a qualified beneficiary "first becomes, after the date of the election . . . covered under any
other group health plan (as an employee or otherwise)." Tax Reform Act
of 1986, Pub. L. 99-514, 100 Stat. 2938-2939. Congress again amended
subsection (i) in 1989, when it added the qualification, "which does not
contain any exclusion or limitation with respect to any preexisting condition of such beneficiary." Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989,
Pub. L. 101-239, 103 Stat. 2297, 2432. The Health Insurance Portability
and Accountability Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104-191, 110 Stat. 2087-2088,
amended $ 1162(2)(D)(i) yet again by inserting before ", or": "(other than
such an exclusion or limitation which does not apply to (or is satisfied by)
such beneficiary by reason of chapter 100 of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, part 7 of subtitle B of title I of the Employee Retirement Income

82 GEISSAL v. MOORE MEDICAL CORP.

Opinion of the Court

B
Moore, like the Magistrate, believes that James Geissal'scoverage under the TWA plan defeats the claim for COBRA

coverage after his election to receive it. As Moore reads$ 1162(2)(D)(i), it is not relevant when a qualified beneficiary
first obtains other health insurance coverage; instead, Mooresubmits, all that matters is whether, at any time after the
date of election, the beneficiary is covered by another grouphealth plan. In any event, Moore claims, James Geissal first
became covered under the TWA plan only after his COBRAelection, because it was only at that moment that his TWA
coverage became primary.Moore's reading, however, will not square with the text.
Section 1162(2)(D)(i) does not provide that the employeris excused if the beneficiary "is" covered or "remains" covered on or after the date of the election. Nothing in$ 1162(2)(D)(i) says anything about the hierarchy of policy
obligations, or otherwise suggests that it might matterwhether the coverage of another group health plan is primary. So far as this case is concerned, what is crucial isthat $ 1162(2)(D)(i) does not speak in terms of "coverage"
that might exist or continue; it speaks in terms of an event,the event of "becom[ing] covered." This event is significant
only if it occurs, and "first" occurs, at a time "after the dateof the election." It is undisputed that both before and after
James Geissal elected COBRA continuation coverage he wascontinuously a beneficiary of TWA's group health plan. Because he was thus covered before he made his COBRA elec-tion, and so did not "first become" covered under the TWA
plan after the date of election, Moore could not cut off hisCOBRA coverage under the plain meaning of $ 1162(2)(D)(i).

Moore argues, to the contrary, that there is a reasonablesense in which a beneficiary does "first becom[e]" covered
under a pre-existing plan "after the date of the election,"even when prior coverage can be said to persist after the
election date: the first moment of coverage on the day follow524us1$75M 02-18-99 19:35:22 PAGES OPINPGT

83Cite as: 524 U. S. 74 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
ing the election is the moment of first being covered afterthe date of the election. See National Cos. Health Benefit

Plan v. St. Joseph's Hosp., Inc., 929 F. 2d 1558, 1570 (CA111991) ("[I]t is immaterial when the employee acquires other
group health coverage; the only relevant question is when,after the election date, does that other coverage take effect.
In the case of an employee covered by preexisting grouphealth coverage, . . . the first time after the election date
that the employee becomes covered by a group health planother than the employer's plan is the moment after the election date"). But that reading ignores the condition that thebeneficiary must "first becom[e]" covered after election, robbing the modifier "first" of any consequence, thereby equat-ing "first becomes . . . covered" with "remains covered." It
transforms the novelty of becoming covered for the first timeinto the continuity of remaining covered over time.

Moore argues, further, that even if our reading of the stat-ute is more faithful to its plain language, Congress could not
have meant to give a qualified beneficiary something morethan the right to preserve the status quo as of the date of
the qualifying event.8 Moore points out that if the phrase"first becomes covered . . . after" the date of election does
not apply to any coverage predating election, then the bene-ficiary is quite free to claim continuation coverage even if
he has obtained entirely new group coverage between thequalifying event and the election; in that case, on our reading, COBRA would not be preserving the circumstances asof the date of the qualifying event.

8 Moore also argues that Congress could not have intended to render
COBRA eligible those individuals with pre-existing coverage under another health plan at the time of election, because such individuals who in
fact elect COBRA coverage are typically high risk. As a result, Moore
contends, covering them under COBRA tends to increase an employer's
overall cost of providing a group health plan, and may cause some employers to cease offering a group health plan entirely. This may or may not
be true. If substantiated, the argument would be considered in construing the scope of a vague provision; $ 1162(2)(D)(i), however, is not vague.

524us1$75M 02-18-99 19:35:22 PAGES OPINPGT
84 GEISSAL v. MOORE MEDICAL CORP.

Opinion of the Court
That the plain reading does not confine COBRA strictly to
guardianship of the status quo is, of course, perfectly true,
though it is much less certain whether this fact should count
against the plain reading (even assuming that the obvious reading would be vulnerable to such an objection, see
Ardestani v. INS, 502 U. S. 129, 135 (1991)). The statute
is neither cast expressly in terms of the status quo, nor does
it speak to the status quo on the date of the qualifying event
except with reference to the coverage subject to election.
Nor does a beneficiary's decision to take advantage of another group policy not previously in effect carry any indicia
of the sort of windfall Congress presumably would have
disapproved. Since the beneficiary has to pay for whatever
COBRA coverage he obtains, there is no reason to assume
that he will make an election for coverage he does not need,
whether he is covered by another policy in place before
the qualifying event or one obtained after it but before his
election.

Still, it is true that if during the interim between the qualifying event and election a beneficiary gets a new job, say,
with health coverage (having no exclusion or limitation for
his condition), he will have the benefit of COBRA, whereas
he will not have it if his new job and coverage come after the
election date. Do we classify this as an anomaly or merely a
necessary consequence of the need to draw a line somewhere? For the sake of argument we might call it an anomaly, but that would only balance it against the anomaly of
Moore's own position, which defies not only normal language
usage but the expectations of common sense: since an election to continue coverage is retroactive to the date of the
qualifying event, under Moore's reading of $ 1162(2)(D)(i) an
election that is ineffective to bring about continuation coverage for the roughly 18 (or 36) month statutory period would
nonetheless have the surprising effect of providing continuation coverage for the period of weeks, or even days, between

85Cite as: 524 U. S. 74 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
the event and the election. One wonders why Congress
would have wanted to create such a strange scheme. Thus,
assuming that our reading of $ 1162(2)(D)(i) produces an
anomaly, so does Moore's.

But this is not all, for the anomalous consequences of
Moore's position are not exhausted without a look at the interpretative morass to which it has led in practice. To support its thesis that Congress meant individuals situated like
James Geissal to be ineligible for COBRA benefits, Moore
points to a statement in the House Reports on the original
COBRA bill, that "[t]he Committee [on Ways and Means] is
concerned with reports of the growing number of Americans
without any health insurance coverage and the decreasing
willingness of our Nation's hospitals to provide care to those
who cannot afford to pay." H. R. Rep. No. 99-241, pt. 1,
p. 44 (1985); see 114 F. 3d, at 1463 (quoting House Report).
Of course, if this concern (expressed in one House Committee
Report) were thought to be a legitimate limit on the meaning
of the statute as enacted, there would be no COBRA coverage for any beneficiary who had "any health insurance" on
the date of election, or obtained "any" thereafter. But neither Moore nor any court rejecting the plain reading has
gone quite so far. Instead, that draconian alternative has
been averted by a nontextual compromise.

The compromise apparently alludes to the proviso that

$ 1162(2)(D)(i) applies so as to authorize termination of
COBRA coverage only if the coverage provided by the other
group health plan "does not contain any exclusion or limitation with respect to any preexisting condition of such beneficiary." Moore urges us to hold, as some Courts of Appeals
have done, that although Congress generally intended to
deny COBRA coverage to individuals with other group insurance on the election date, there will still be COBRA eligibility in such cases if there is a "significant gap" between the
coverage offered by the employer's plan and that offered by

86 GEISSAL v. MOORE MEDICAL CORP.

Opinion of the Court
the beneficiary's other group health plan.9 See 114 F. 3d, at1464-1465; accord, National Cos. Health Benefit Plan v. St.

Joseph's Hosp., Inc., 929 F. 2d, at 1571; Brock v. Primedica,Inc., 904 F. 2d 295, 297 (CA5 1990). When there is such a
gap, some courts have explained, it cannot be said that theemployee is truly "covered" by his pre-existing insurance
coverage. See 114 F. 3d, at 1463; National Cos. Health Benefit Plan v. St. Joseph's Hosp., Inc., supra, at 1571.This "significant gap" approach to $ 1162(2)(D)(i) is plagued

with difficulties, however, beginning with the sheer absenceof any statutory support for it. Section 1162(2)(D)(i) makes
no mention of what to do when a person's other coverage is
generally inadequate or inferior; instead, it provides merelythat coverage under a later acquired group health plan will

not terminate COBRA rights when that plan limits or ex-cludes coverage for a pre-existing condition of the beneficiary. The proviso applies not when there is a "gap" or dif-ference between the respective coverages of the two policies,
but when the later acquired group coverage excludes or lim-its coverage specific to the beneficiary's pre-existing condition. It is this "gap" between different coverage provisions
of the non-COBRA plan, not a gap between the coverageprovisions of the COBRA plan and the non-COBRA plan,

that Congress was legislating about.But even leaving textual inadequacy aside, there is further
trouble under the "significant gap" approach. Needless tosay, when the proviso (as written) arguably does apply, its
applicability is easy to determine. Once the beneficiary'spre-existing condition is identified, a court need only look
among the terms of the later policy for an exclusion or limita9 The lower courts have disagreed about whether this "significant gap"
interpretation should be made by evaluating the actual expenses an employee incurs as a result of COBRA cancellation, or by comparing the
policies' provisions in light of the information available to the employer on
the day of the COBRA election. See 114 F. 3d, at 1464-1465 (comparing
approaches).

Opinion of the Court
tion peculiar to that condition. If either is found, COBRAcontinuation coverage is left undisturbed; if neither is found,

the consequence of obtaining this later insurance is auto-matic. Applying the significant gap rule, on the other hand,
requires a very different kind of determination, essentiallyone of social policy. Once a gap is found, the court must
then make a judgment about the adequacy of medical insur-ance under the later group policy, for this is the essence of
any decision about whether the gap between the two regimesof coverage is "significant" enough. This is a powerful point
against the gap interpretation for two reasons. First, therequired judgment is so far unsuitable for courts that we
would expect a clear mandate before inferring that Congressmeant to foist it on the judiciary.

10 What is even more

strange, however, is that Congress would have meant to in-ject the courts into the policy arena, evaluating the adequacy

of non-COBRA coverage that happened to be in place priorto the COBRA election, while at the same time intending to
limit the judicial intrusion, and leave the beneficiary to theunmediated legal consequences of the terms of the nonCOBRA coverage that happened to become effective afterthe election. One just cannot credibly attribute such oddity
to congressional intent.In sum, there is no justification for disparaging the clarity
of $ 1162(2)(D)(i). The judgment of the Court of Appeals isvacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings
consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

10 The unlikelihood, indeed, appears overwhelming when one considers
that the same comparison would have to be made when the beneficiary
was covered under Medicare, which is treated like a separate group plan
for present purposes, see $ 1162(2)(D)(ii).

Syllabus

HOPKINS, WARDEN v. REEVES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eighth circuit

No. 96-1693. Argued February 23, 1998--Decided June 8, 1998
Respondent was indicted on two counts of felony murder under Nebraska

law. The Nebraska first-degree murder statute defines felony murder
as murder committed in the perpetration of certain enumerated felonies,
including, as relevant here, sexual assault and attempt to commit sexual
assault in the first degree. Under Nebraska law, intent to kill is conclusively presumed if the State proves intent to commit the underlying
felony. A felony-murder conviction makes a defendant eligible for the
death penalty, which in Nebraska is imposed judicially, not by the trial
jury. The trial court refused respondent's request to instruct the jury
on second-degree murder and manslaughter on the ground that the
State Supreme Court consistently has held that these crimes are not
lesser included offenses of felony murder. Respondent's jury then convicted him on both felony-murder counts, and a three-judge panel sentenced him to death. After exhausting his state remedies, respondent
filed a federal habeas corpus petition, claiming, inter alia, that the trial
court's failure to give the requested instructions was unconstitutional
under Beck v. Alabama, 447 U. S. 625, in which this Court invalidated
an Alabama law that prohibited lesser included offense instructions in
capital cases, when lesser included offenses to the charged crime existed
under state law and such instructions were generally given in noncapital
cases. The District Court granted relief on an unrelated due process
claim, which the Eighth Circuit rejected. However, the Eighth Circuit
also held that, in failing to give the requested instructions, the trial
court had committed the same constitutional error as that in Beck.

Held: Beck does not require state trial courts to instruct juries on offenses

that are not lesser included offenses of the charged crime under state
law. Pp. 94-101.

(a) Beck is distinguishable from this case in two critical respects: The
Alabama statute prohibited instructions on offenses that state law
clearly recognized as lesser included offenses of the charged crime, and
it did so only in capital cases. Alabama thus erected an artificial barrier
that restricted its juries to a choice between conviction for a capital
offense and acquittal. By contrast, when the Nebraska trial court declined to give the requested instructions, it merely followed the State
Supreme Court's 100-year-old rule that second-degree murder and man524US1 Unit: $U76 [09-06-00 18:29:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN

89Cite as: 524 U. S. 88 (1998)
Syllabus
slaughter are not lesser included offenses of felony murder. The trial
court neither created an artificial barrier for the jury nor treated capital
and noncapital cases differently. By ignoring these distinctions, the
Eighth Circuit limited the State's prerogative to structure its criminal
law more severely than does the rule in Beck, for it required in effect
that States create lesser included offenses to all capital crimes when no
such offense exists under state law. Pp. 94-97.

(b) The Eighth Circuit again overlooked significant distinctions between this case and Beck when it found that there was a distortion of
the factfinding process because respondent's jury had been forced into
an all-or-nothing choice between capital murder and innocence. The
fact that Beck's jury was told that if it convicted him of the charged
offense it must impose the death penalty threatened to make the issue
at trial whether he should be executed or not, and not whether he was
guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The distortion of the trial process
carried over to sentencing because an Alabama jury unwilling to acquit
had no choice but to impose death. These factors are not present here.
Respondent's jury did not impose sentence, and the sentencing panel's
alternative to death was not setting respondent free, but rather sentencing him to life imprisonment. Moreover, respondent's proposed instructions would have introduced another kind of distortion at trial, for
they would have allowed the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt
elements that the State, having assumed the obligation of proving only
one crime, had not attempted to prove and indeed had ignored during
trial. Pp. 98-99.

(c) The requirement of Tison v. Arizona, 481 U. S. 137, and Enmund
v. Florida, 458 U. S. 782, that a culpable mental state with respect to
the killing be proved before the death penalty may be imposed for felony murder does not affect the showing that a State must make at a
defendant's felony-murder trial, so long as the requirement is satisfied
at some point thereafter, such as at sentencing or on appeal. Cabana
v. Bullock, 474 U. S. 376, 385, 392. As such, these cases cannot override
state-law determinations of when instructions on lesser included offenses are permissible and when they are not. Respondent's argument
that the Nebraska Supreme Court's longstanding interpretation that felony murder has no lesser included homicide offenses is arbitrary is without merit. That contention is certainly strained with respect to the
crime of second-degree murder, which requires proof of intent to kill,
while felony murder does not; respondent did not present such a challenge with respect to manslaughter to the Nebraska Supreme Court,
and therefore that claim is not considered here. Pp. 99-101.

102 F. 3d 977, reversed.

conclude that such instructions are not constitutionally re-quired, and we therefore reverse the contrary judgment of

the Court of Appeals. I

In the early morning hours of March 29, 1980, police re-ceived an emergency call from the Religious Society of
Friends meetinghouse in Lincoln, Nebraska. Responding tothe call, they found Janet Mesner, the live-in caretaker, lying
on the floor in the rear of the house with seven stab woundsin her chest. When an officer asked who had stabbed her,
Mesner gave respondent's name. The officers then went toan upstairs bedroom and found the partially clad dead body
of Victoria Lamm, a friend of Mesner who had been visitingthe meetinghouse. She had been stabbed twice, the first
blow penetrating the main pulmonary artery of her heartand the second her liver. A billfold containing respondent's
identification was lying near Lamm's body. The police foundunderwear, later identified as respondent's, in the middle of
the blood-soaked sheets of the bed; subsequent examinationof the underwear revealed semen of respondent's blood type.
Near the bed, the police found a serrated kitchen knife withMesner's blood on it. Before dying, Mesner told an officer
that respondent had raped her. Shortly thereafter, the po-lice arrested respondent, who told them that although he
could not remember much about the murders due to severeintoxication, he did recall stabbing and raping Mesner.

The State proceeded against respondent for both murderson a felony-murder theory. Under Nebraska law, felony
murder is a form of first-degree murder and is defined asmurder committed "in the perpetration of or attempt to perpetrate" certain enumerated felonies, including sexual as-sault or attempt to commit sexual assault in the first degree.

on both murder in the second degree and manslaughter,which, he argued, were lesser included offenses of felony
murder. App. 6-9.1 The trial court refused on the groundthat the Nebraska Supreme Court consistently has held that
second-degree murder and manslaughter are not lesser in-cluded offenses of that crime.

Id., at 10. Respondent's jury
thus was presented with only the two felony-murder counts.2Although respondent raised an insanity defense, the jury rejected it and convicted him on both counts. A three-judgesentencing panel then convened to consider aggravating and
mitigating circumstances. It sentenced respondent to death
on both convictions.

After the Nebraska Supreme Court affirmed his convictions and sentences, State v. Reeves, 216 Neb. 206, 344 N. W.
2d 433, cert. denied, 469 U. S. 1028 (1984), respondent unsuccessfully pursued state collateral relief, State v. Reeves, 234
Neb. 711, 453 N. W. 2d 359 (1990). This Court then vacated
the Nebraska Supreme Court's judgment for further consideration in light of Clemons v. Mississippi, 494 U. S. 738
(1990), because respondent's death sentence had been based
in part on an invalid aggravating factor. See Reeves v. Nebraska, 498 U. S. 964 (1990). On remand, the Nebraska Su1 Under Nebraska law, second-degree murder is defined as "caus[ing] the

quarrel, or caus[ing] the death of another unintentionally while in the commission of an unlawful act," $ 28-305.

preme Court followed Clemons, independently reweighedthe applicable aggravating and mitigating factors, and reaffirmed respondent's sentences. State v. Reeves, 239 Neb.419, 476 N. W. 2d 829 (1991), cert. denied, 506 U. S. 837 (1992).

Respondent then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in Federal District Court. He raised 44 claims, includ-ing a claim that the trial court's failure to give his requested

instructions was unconstitutional under Beck. The DistrictCourt rejected the

Beck claim but granted relief on an unrelated ground. 871 F. Supp. 1182, 1202, 1205-1206 (Neb.1994). After the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit

reversed the latter determination and remanded the case,
76 F. 3d 1424, 1427-1431 (1996), the District Court again
granted respondent's petition, finding a due process violation arising out of the reaffirmance of his sentences by the
Nebraska Supreme Court. See 928 F. Supp. 941, 959-965
(Neb. 1996).

On the State's appeal, the Court of Appeals held that although respondent was not entitled to relief on his due process claim, the Nebraska trial court had committed constitutional error in failing to give the requested second-degree
murder and manslaughter instructions. 102 F. 3d 977
(1997). The Court of Appeals reasoned that the constitutional error was the same as that in Beck, despite the fact
that there are no lesser included homicide offenses to felony
murder under Nebraska law: In both cases, state law "prohibited instructions on noncapital murder charges in cases
where conviction made the defendant death-eligible." 102
F. 3d, at 983 (emphasis in original). Because respondent
"could have been convicted and sentenced for either second
degree murder or manslaughter," the Court of Appeals concluded that he was constitutionally entitled to his proposed
instructions. See id., at 984. It further stated that denial
of the instructions could not be justified by the fact that felony murder in Nebraska does not require a culpable mental
state with respect to the killing, because in Enmund v. Flor524US1 Unit: $U76 [09-06-00 18:29:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ida, 458 U. S. 782 (1982), and Tison v. Arizona, 481 U. S. 137(1987), this Court held that the death penalty could not be

imposed in a felony-murder case if the defendant was a minorparticipant in the crime and neither intended to kill nor had
shown reckless indifference to human life. See 102 F. 3d, at984-985. The Court of Appeals therefore granted respondent's petition and, relying on Circuit precedent holding that
Beck applies only where the defendant is in fact sentencedto death, gave the State the option of retrying respondent

or agreeing to modify his sentence to life imprisonment.See 102 F. 3d, at 986.

Because the decision below conflicted with a prior decisionof the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, see

Greena-walt v. Ricketts, 943 F. 2d 1020 (1991), cert. denied, 506 U. S.

The Court of Appeals erred in concluding that its holdingwas compelled by Beck, as the two cases differ fundamentally. In Beck, the defendant was indicted and convicted ofthe capital offense of " `[r]obbery or attempts thereof when
the victim is intentionally killed by the defendant.' " 447
U. S., at 627 (quoting Ala. Code $ 13-11-2(a)(2) (1975)). Al-though state law recognized the noncapital, lesser included

offense of felony murder, see 447 U. S., at 628-630, and al-though lesser included offense instructions were generally
available to noncapital defendants under state law, the Ala3 One of the questions on which we granted certiorari was whether the
Court of Appeals' holding was a "new rule" under Teague v. Lane, 489
U. S. 288 (1989). See Pet. for Cert. i. Because the State raised this argument for the first time in its petition for a writ of certiorari, we choose to
decide the case on the merits. Cf. Godinez v. Moran, 509 U. S. 389, 397,
n. 8 (1993) (declining to address whether the Court of Appeals created a
"new rule" because the petitioner did not raise a Teague defense in the
lower courts or in its petition for certiorari).

Opinion of the Court
bama death penalty statute prohibited such instructions in
capital cases, id., at 628. As a result, Alabama juries had
only two options: to convict the defendant of the capital
crime, in which case they were required to impose the death
penalty,4 or to acquit. Id., at 628-629. We found that the
denial of the third option of convicting the defendant of a
noncapital lesser included offense "diminish[ed] the reliability of the guilt determination." Id., at 638. Without such
an option, if the jury believed that the defendant had committed some other serious offense, it might convict him of
the capital crime rather than acquit him altogether. See id.,
at 642-643. We therefore held that Alabama was "constitutionally prohibited from withdrawing that option from the
jury in a capital case." See id., at 638.

In Nebraska, instructions on offenses that have been determined to be lesser included offenses of the charged crime
are available to defendants when the evidence supports
them, in capital and noncapital cases alike.5 Respondent's
proposed instructions were refused because the Nebraska
Supreme Court has held for over 100 years, in both capital
and noncapital cases, that second-degree murder and manslaughter are not lesser included offenses of felony murder.
See, e. g., State v. Price, 252 Neb. 365, 372, 562 N. W. 2d 340,
346 (1997); State v. Masters, 246 Neb. 1018, 1025, 524 N. W.

4 If the jury imposed the death penalty, the trial judge had the authority
to reduce the sentence to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. The jury, however, was not instructed to this effect; rather, it was
told that it was required to impose the death penalty if it found the defendant guilty. See 447 U. S., at 639, n. 15.

5 We noted this fact in Beck in distinguishing Alabama's scheme from

the practices in the rest of the States. See 447 U. S., at 636, n. 12 (citing
State v. Hegwood, 202 Neb. 379, 275 N. W. 2d 605 (1979)).

court gives instructions on those offenses, and the defendantis convicted only of second-degree murder or manslaughter,
that conviction must be reversed on appeal. See Thompsonv.

State, supra, at 396, 184 N. W., at 68. Thus, as a matterof law, Nebraska prosecutors cannot obtain convictions for

second-degree murder or manslaughter in a felony-murdertrial.

Beck is therefore distinguishable from this case in two crit-ical respects. The Alabama statute prohibited instructions
on offenses that state law clearly recognized as lesser in-cluded offenses of the charged crime, and it did so only in
capital cases. Alabama thus erected an "artificial barrier"that restricted its juries to a choice between conviction for
a capital offense and acquittal. Brief for United States as
Amicus Curiae 20 (citing California v. Ramos, 463 U. S. 992,1007 (1983)). Here, by contrast, the Nebraska trial court

did not deny respondent instructions on any existing lesserincluded offense of felony murder; it merely declined to give
instructions on crimes that are not lesser included offenses.In so doing, the trial court did not create an "artificial barrier" for the jury; nor did it treat capital cases differentlyfrom noncapital cases. Instead, it simply followed the
Nebraska Supreme Court's interpretation of the relevantoffenses under state law.

By ignoring these distinctions, the Court of Appeals lim-ited state sovereignty in a manner more severe than the rule
in Beck. Almost all States, including Nebraska, provide in-structions only on those offenses that have been deemed to
constitute lesser included offenses of the charged crime.See n. 5, supra.

6 We have never suggested that the Consti6 In determining whether an offense is a lesser included offense of a
particular crime, the States have adopted a variety of approaches. See,
e. g., State v. Berlin, 133 Wash. 2d 541, 550-551, 947 P. 2d 700, 704-705

Opinion of the Court
tution requires anything more. The Court of Appeals inthis case, however, required in effect that States create

lesser included offenses to all capital crimes, by requiringthat an instruction be given on some other offense--what
could be called a "lesser related offense"--when no lesserincluded offense exists. Such a requirement is not only unprecedented, but also unworkable. Under such a scheme,there would be no basis for determining the offenses for
which instructions are warranted. The Court of Appealsapparently would recognize a constitutional right to an instruction on any offense that bears a resemblance to thecharged crime and is supported by the evidence. Such an
affirmative obligation is unquestionably a greater limitationon a State's prerogative to structure its criminal law than is
Beck's rule that a State may not erect a capital-specific, arti(1997) (en banc) (comparing statutory elements of the lesser offense to
determine whether all of them are contained in the greater offense); People v. Beach, 429 Mich. 450, 462, 418 N. W. 2d 861, 866-867 (1988) (applying
the "cognate evidence" approach: a lesser included offense instruction may
be given even though all of the statutory elements of the lesser offense are
not contained in the greater offense, if the "overlapping elements relate to
the common purpose of the statutes" and the specific evidence adduced
would support an instruction on the cognate offense (internal quotation
marks and citation omitted)); State v. Curtis, 130 Idaho 522, 524, 944 P. 2d
119, 121-122 (1997) (court looks both to the statutory elements and to the
information to determine whether it "charges the accused with a crime
the proof of which necessarily includes proof of the acts that constitute
the lesser included offense"). Cf. Schmuck v. United States, 489 U. S. 705
(1989) (adopting statutory elements test for federal criminal law).

Since the time of respondent's conviction, Nebraska has alternated between use of the statutory elements test and the cognate evidence test; it
currently employs the former. See State v. Williams, 243 Neb. 959, 963-
965, 503 N. W. 2d 561, 564-565 (1993) (readopting statutory elements test),
overruling State v. Garza, 236 Neb. 202, 207-208, 459 N. W. 2d 739, 743
(1990) (reaffirming cognate evidence test), disapproving State v. Lovelace,
212 Neb. 356, 359-360, 322 N. W. 2d 673, 674-675 (1982) (applying statutory
elements test). It has nonetheless consistently reaffirmed its holding that
felony murder has no lesser included homicide offenses.

Opinion of the Court
ficial barrier to the provision of instructions on offenses that
actually are lesser included offenses under state law.

The Court of Appeals justified its holding principally on
the ground that respondent had been placed in the same position as the defendant in Beck--that there had been a distortion of the factfinding process because his jury had been
" `forced into an all-or-nothing choice between capital murder
and innocence.' " 102 F. 3d, at 982 (quoting Spaziano v.
Florida, 468 U. S. 447, 455 (1984)). In so doing, the Court
of Appeals again overlooked significant distinctions between
this case and Beck. In Beck, the death penalty was automatically tied to conviction, and Beck's jury was told that if
it convicted the defendant of the charged offense, it was required to impose the death penalty. See Beck v. Alabama,
447 U. S., at 639, n. 15. This threatened to make the issue
at trial whether the defendant should be executed or not,
rather than "whether the State ha[d] proved each and every
element of the capital crime beyond a reasonable doubt."
Id., at 643, n. 19. In addition, the distortion of the trial process carried over directly to sentencing, because an Alabama
jury unwilling to acquit had no choice but to impose the
death penalty. There was thus a significant possibility that
the death penalty would be imposed upon defendants whose
conduct did not merit it, simply because their juries might
be convinced that they had committed some serious crime
and should not escape punishment entirely.

These factors are not present here. Respondent's jury did
not have the burden of imposing a sentence. Indeed, with
respect to respondent's insanity defense, it was specifically
instructed that it had "no right to take into consideration
what punishment or disposition he may or may not receive
in the event of his conviction or . . . acquittal by reason of
insanity." App. 24. In addition, the three-judge panel that
imposed the death penalty did not have to consider the dilemma faced by Beck's jury; its alternative to death was not

Opinion of the Court
setting respondent free, but rather sentencing him to lifeimprisonment.

7

Moreover, respondent's proposed instructions would haveintroduced another kind of distortion at trial. Nebraska

proceeded against respondent only on a theory of felony mur-der, a crime that under state law has no lesser included homicide offenses. The State therefore assumed the obligation
of proving only that crime, as well as any lesser includedoffenses that existed under state law and were supported by

the evidence; its entire case focused solely on that obligation.To allow respondent to be convicted of homicide offenses that
are not lesser included offenses of felony murder, therefore,would be to allow his jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt
elements that the State had not attempted to prove, and indeed that it had ignored during the course of trial. This canhardly be said to be a reliable result: "Where no lesser included offense exists, a lesser included offense instruction
detracts from, rather than enhances, the rationality of the
process." Spaziano v. Florida, supra, at 455.

The Court of Appeals also erroneously relied upon our decisions in Tison v. Arizona, 481 U. S. 137 (1987), and Enmund v. Florida, 458 U. S. 782 (1982), to support its holding.
It reasoned that because those cases require proof of a culpable mental state with respect to the killing before the death
penalty may be imposed for felony murder, Nebraska could
not refuse lesser included offense instructions on the ground
that the only intent required for a felony-murder conviction
is the intent to commit the underlying felony. See 102 F. 3d,
at 984. In so doing, the Court of Appeals read Tison and

7 We are not, of course, presented with a case that differs from Beck
only in that the jury is not the sentencer, and we express no opinion
here whether that difference alone would render Beck inapplicable. The
crucial distinction between Beck and this case, as noted, is the distinction
between a State's prohibiting instructions on offenses that state law recognizes as lesser included, and a State's refusing to instruct on offenses that
state law does not recognize as lesser included.

Opinion of the Court
Enmund as essentially requiring the States to alter theirdefinitions of felony murder to include a mens rea requirement with respect to the killing.8 In Cabana v. Bullock, 474U. S. 376 (1986), however, we rejected precisely such a reading and stated that "our ruling in Enmund does not concernthe guilt or innocence of the defendant--it establishes no
new elements of the crime of murder that must be found bythe jury" and "does not affect the state's definition of any
substantive offense." Id., at 385 (internal quotation marksand citation omitted). For this reason, we held that a State
could comply with Enmund's requirement at sentencing oreven on appeal. See 474 U. S., at 392. Accordingly,

Tisonand
Enmund do not affect the showing that a State mustmake at a defendant's trial for felony murder, so long as their

requirement is satisfied at some point thereafter. As such,these cases cannot override state-law determinations of
when instructions on lesser included offenses are permissibleand when they are not.

Finally, respondent argues that the Nebraska SupremeCourt's longstanding interpretation that felony murder has
no lesser included homicide offenses is arbitrary because, inhis view, it is based only on recitations from prior cases,
rather than on application of the lesser included offense testsin place since his conviction. See Brief for Respondent 40-
43. This contention is certainly strained with respect to thecrime of second-degree murder, which requires proof of
intent to kill, while felony murder does not. See Neb. Rev.Stat. $$ 28-303, 28-304 (1995). It appears that the Nebraska Supreme Court has not undertaken respondent's sug-gested analysis with respect to unlawful act manslaughter--
unintentional killing, committed in the perpetration of anunlawful act. See $ 28-305. On his direct appeal, however,
respondent did not challenge the Nebraska Supreme Court's

8 The dissent also appears to be of this view, contending that Nebraska's
justification for not providing an instruction on second-degree murder is
inapplicable when the death penalty is sought. See post, at 101-102.

interpretation on this ground, and the clearest statement inhis briefs on why a manslaughter instruction should have

been given referred to manslaughter generally, for the fol-lowing reason: "As the Court ruled in State v. Ellis, 208 Neb.
379, 303 N. W. 2d 741 (1981), such an instruction is necessary`where there is no eye witness to the act, and the evidence
is largely circumstantial.' " Reply Brief for Appellant in
No. 81-706 (Neb. Sup. Ct.), p. 11. We will not second-guessthe Nebraska Supreme Court's 100-year-old interpretation

of state law when respondent failed to present his challengeto that court in the first instance.

For the foregoing reasons, the Court of Appeals' judgmentgranting respondent a conditional writ of habeas corpus is
reversed. It is so ordered.

Justice Stevens, dissenting.
As a matter of Nebraska law, second-degree murder is
not ordinarily a lesser included offense of felony murder.1Based in part on this fact, the Court holds that it was not

necessary for the trial judge to grant respondent's requestfor an instruction authorizing the jury to find respondent
guilty of that offense. The Court's logic would be unassail-able if the State had not sought the death penalty.

The reason that Nebraska generally does not consider
second-degree murder a lesser included offense of felonymurder is that it requires evidence of an intent to cause the

death of the victim, whereas felony murder does not. Butin this case the State sought to impose the death penalty on
respondent for the offense of felony murder. As a matter offederal constitutional law, under

Enmund v. Florida, 458
U. S. 782 (1982), it could not do so without proving that re1 See, e. g., State v. Price, 252 Neb. 365, 373, 562 N. W. 2d 340, 346 (1997);

spondent intended to kill his victim, or under Tison v. Ari-zona, 481 U. S. 137 (1987), that he had the moral equivalent

of such an intent. The rationale for Nebraska's general rulethat second-degree murder is not a lesser included offense of
felony murder does not, therefore, apply to this case.2 Tobe faithful to the teaching of Beck v. Alabama, 447 U. S. 625
(1980), the Court should therefore hold that respondent wasentitled to the requested instruction.

Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.

2 Moreover, a recent Nebraska Supreme Court decision suggests that
Nebraska law may be in flux on the question whether second-degree murder is a lesser included offense of felony murder. Only a few weeks ago,
the Nebraska Supreme Court held that a jury verdict finding a defendant
guilty of second-degree murder constituted an implied acquittal of the
crime of first-degree murder, as defined in $ 28-303 of Nebraska's criminal
code, and therefore barred a second prosecution under that section for
either felony murder or premeditated murder. Nebraska v. White, 254
Neb. 566, 577 N. W. 2d 741 (1998). In reaching that holding the Court
explained: "The conduct prohibited by $ 28-303 is first degree murder.
Premeditated murder and felony murder are not denominated in Nebraska's statutes as separate and independent offenses, but only ways in which
criminal liability for first degree murder may be charged and prosecuted."
Id., at 577, 577 N. W. 2d, at 748. The difference between a charge of
premeditated murder and a charge of felony murder "is a difference in the
State's theory of how [the defendant] committed the single offense of first
degree murder. . . . Therefore, we hold that the crime of first degree murder, as defined in $ 28-303, constitutes one offense even though there may
be alternate theories by which criminal liability for first degree murder
may be charged and prosecuted in Nebraska." Ibid. Given this holding,
the Nebraska Supreme Court may conclude that second-degree murder is
a lesser included offense of both premeditated and felony murder, as they
are both part of the "one offense" of first-degree murder.

CASS COUNTY, MINNESOTA, et al. v. LEECH LAKE

BAND OF CHIPPEWA INDIANS

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eighth circuit

No. 97-174. Argued February 24, 1998--Decided June 8, 1998
During the late 19th century, the Federal Government instituted a policy

of removing portions of reservation land from tribal ownership and federal protection, allotting some parcels to individual Indians in fee simple
and providing for other parcels to be sold to non-Indians. Most allotments were implemented pursuant to the General Allotment Act (GAA),
which provided that land would be patented to individual Indians and
held in trust for 25 years, after which title would be conveyed in fee
simple, $ 5, and that Indian allottees were subject to plenary state jurisdiction, $ 6. The Burke Act amended $ 6 to provide that state jurisdiction did not attach until the end of the trust period, and contained a
proviso to the effect that the Secretary of the Interior could issue a fee
simple patent before the trust period's end and thereafter restrictions as
to, inter alia, taxation would be removed. Allotment of the Minnesota
reservation lands of respondent Leech Lake Band of Chippewa Indians
(Band) was implemented through the Nelson Act of 1889, which provided for the reservation land to be alienated from tribal ownership in
three ways: under $ 3, parcels were allotted to individual Indians as
provided by the GAA; under $$ 4 and 5, pine lands were sold at public
auction to non-Indians; and under $ 6, agricultural lands were sold to
non-Indian settlers as homesteads. After Congress ended the allotment practice, the Band began purchasing back parcels of reservation
land that had been allotted to individual Indians or sold to non-Indians.
Based on this Court's decision, in County of Yakima v. Confederated
Tribes and Bands of Yakima Nation, 502 U. S. 251, 253-254, that a
county could assess ad valorem taxes on reservation land owned in fee
by individual Indians or the tribe that had originally been made alienable when patented under the GAA, petitioner Cass County began assessing such taxes on 21 parcels of reservation land that had been alienated under the Nelson Act and reacquired by the Band. Thirteen of
the parcels had been allotted to Indians and the remaining eight had
been sold to non-Indians. The Band paid the taxes, interest, and penalties under protest and filed suit seeking a declaratory judgment that the
county could not tax the parcels. The District Court granted the
county summary judgment, holding that the parcels were taxable be524US1 Unit: $U77 [09-06-00 18:33:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN

cause, under Yakima, if Congress has made Indian land freely alienable,
States may tax the land. The Eighth Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part, holding that the parcels allotted to Indians could be
taxed if patented under the Burke Act proviso, which made "unmistakably clear" Congress' intent to allow such taxation, but that the eight
parcels sold to non-Indians could not. Only those eight parcels are at
issue here.

Held: State and local governments may impose ad valorem taxes on reservation land that was made alienable by Congress and sold to nonIndians, but was later repurchased by the tribe. Pp. 110-115.

(a) Congress' intent to authorize state and local taxation of Indian
reservation land must be " `unmistakably clear.' " Yakima, supra, at
258. Congress has manifested such an intent when it has authorized
reservation lands to be allotted in fee to individual Indians, making the
lands freely alienable and withdrawing them from federal protection.
This was the case in both Yakima and Goudy v. Meath, 203 U. S. 146.
The Goudy Court concluded that, because it would be unreasonable for
Congress to withdraw federal protection and permit an Indian to dispose of his lands as he pleased, while releasing the lands from taxation,
Congress would have to "clearly manifest" such a contrary purpose in
order to counteract the consequence of taxability that ordinarily flows
from alienability. Id., at 149. The Yakima Court found that both the
Burke Act proviso and $ 5 of the GAA manifested an unmistakably clear
intent to allow state and local taxation of allotted land. The Eighth
Circuit thus erred in concluding that Yakima turned on the Burke Act
proviso's express reference to taxability. Both it and Goudy stand for
the proposition that when Congress makes reservation lands freely
alienable, it is unmistakably clear that Congress intends that land to be
taxable by state and local governments, unless a contrary intent is
"clearly manifested." Yakima, supra, at 259. Pp. 110-113.

(b) The foregoing principle controls the disposition of this case. By
providing for the public sale of reservation land to non-Indians in the
Nelson Act, Congress removed that land from federal protection and
made it fully alienable. Under Yakima and Goudy, therefore, it is taxable. The Eighth Circuit's contrary holding attributes to Congress the
odd intent that parcels conveyed to Indians are taxable, while parcels
sold to the general public remain tax exempt. Contrary to the Band's
argument, a tribe's subsequent repurchase of alienable reservation land
does not manifest any congressional intent to reassume federal protection of the land and to oust state taxing authority, particularly when
Congress relinquished such protection many years before. Further,

106 CASS COUNTY v. LEECH LAKE BAND OF

CHIPPEWA INDIANS

Opinion of the Court

Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.
We granted certiorari in this case to resolve whether stateand local governments may tax reservation land that was

made alienable by Congress and sold to non-Indians by theFederal Government, but was later repurchased by a tribe.
We hold that ad valorem taxes may be imposed upon suchland because, under the test established by our precedents,
Congress has made "unmistakably clear" its intent to allowsuch taxation.

I
The Leech Lake Band of Chippewa Indians is a federallyrecognized Indian tribe. The Leech Lake Reservation,

which today encompasses 588,684 acres within the northernMinnesota counties of Cass, Itasca, and Beltrami, was established by federal treaty in 1855 and was augmented by sub-sequent treaties and Executive Orders.

During the late 19th century, the Federal Governmentchanged its policy of setting aside reservation lands exclusively for Indian tribes under federal supervision. The new"allotment" policy removed significant portions of reservation land from tribal ownership and federal protection, allot-ting some parcels to individual Indians and providing for
other parcels to be sold to non-Indians. See County of Yakima v. Confederated Tribes and Bands of Yakima Nation,502 U. S. 251, 253-254 (1992); F. Cohen, Handbook of Federal

Indian Law 127-138 (1982). The purpose of the policy wasto assimilate Indians into American society and to open reservation lands to ownership by non-Indians. Id., at 128.Most of the allotments made by the Federal Government
were implemented pursuant to the General Allotment Act of
McGaw; and for the National Congress of American Indians by Tracy A.
Labin and Kim Jerome Gottschalk.

Opinion of the Court
1887 (GAA), 24 Stat. 388, as amended, 25 U. S. C. $ 331 et seq.
Section 5 of the GAA provided that parcels of tribal land
would be patented to individual Indians and held in trust
by the United States for a 25-year period, after which the
Federal Government would convey title to the individual
allottees--

"in fee, discharged of said trust and free of all charge or
incumbrance whatsoever . . . . And if any conveyance
shall be made of the lands set apart and allotted as
herein provided, or any contract made touching the
same, before the expiration of the time above mentioned,
such conveyance or contract shall be absolutely null and
void . . . ." 25 U. S. C. $ 348.

Section 6 of the GAA, as originally enacted in 1887, provided
that "each and every member of the respective bands or
tribes of Indians to whom allotments have been made shall
have the benefit of and be subject to the laws, both civil and
criminal, of the State or Territory in which they may reside."
24 Stat. 388. In 1905, this Court interpreted $ 6 to mean
that Indian allottees were subject to plenary state jurisdiction immediately upon issuance of the trust patent. See In
re Heff, 197 U. S. 488.

The following year, Congress reversed the result of In re
Heff by passing the Burke Act, 34 Stat. 182, 25 U. S. C. $ 349,
which amended $ 6 of the GAA to provide that state jurisdiction did not attach until the end of the 25-year trust period,
when the lands were conveyed to the Indians in fee. The
Burke Act also contained a proviso to the effect that the
Secretary of the Interior could, if "satisfied that any Indian
allottee is competent and capable of managing his or her affairs," authorize issuance of a fee simple patent to the land
before the end of the usual trust period, "and thereafter all
restrictions as to sale, incumbrance, or taxation of said land
shall be removed . . . ." Ibid.

108 CASS COUNTY v. LEECH LAKE BAND OF

CHIPPEWA INDIANS

Opinion of the Court

For the Leech Lake Band and other Chippewa Tribes inMinnesota, the allotment policy was implemented through

the Nelson Act of 1889. 25 Stat. 642. The Nelson Act pro-vided for the "complete cession and relinquishment" of tribal
title to all reservation land in the State of Minnesota, except
for parts of two reservations, to the United States. Aftersuch "complete cession and relinquishment," which "operate[d] as a complete extinguishment of Indian title," thelands were to be disposed of in one of three ways: under

$ 3, the United States would allot parcels to individual tribemembers as provided in the GAA; under $$ 4 and 5, so-called
"pine lands" (surveyed 40-acre lots with standing or growing
pine timber) were to be sold by the United States at public
auction to the highest bidder; and under $ 6, the remainder
of the reservation land (called "agricultural lands") was to be
sold by the United States to non-Indian settlers under the
provisions of the Homestead Act of 1862, 12 Stat. 392.

In 1934, federal Indian policy shifted dramatically when
Congress enacted the Indian Reorganization Act, 48 Stat.
984, 25 U. S. C. $ 461 et seq., which ended the practice of making federal allotments to individual Indians. Although the
Reorganization Act did not repeal allotment statutes such as
the Nelson Act, it extended the trust period for lands already
allotted but not yet fee patented, provided that unallotted
surplus lands would be restored to tribal ownership, and allowed additional lands "within or without existing reservations" to be acquired by the Federal Government for the
tribes. See $$ 461, 462, 463, 465.

In 1977, the Leech Lake Band and individual Band members owned only about 27,000 acres--less than five percent--
of Leech Lake Reservation land. See State v. Forge, 262
N. W. 2d 341, 343, and n. 1 (Minn. 1977). Since then, the
Leech Lake Band has sought to reestablish its land base by
purchasing back parcels of reservation land that were allotted to individual Indians or sold to non-Indians during the
allotment period.

Opinion of the Court
In 1992, we held in County of Yakima v. ConfederatedTribes and Bands of Yakima Nation, supra, that a county

could assess ad valorem taxes on reservation land owned infee by individual Indians or the tribe and originally made
alienable when patented in fee simple under the GAA.In 1993, Cass County began assessing ad valorem taxes on
21 parcels of reservation land that had been alienated fromtribal control under the various provisions of the Nelson Act
and later reacquired by the Leech Lake Band. Thirteen ofthe parcels had been allotted to individual Indians under $ 3;
seven had been sold to non-Indians as pine lands under $$ 4and 5 for commercial timber harvest; and one parcel had
been distributed to a non-Indian under $ 6 as a homesteadplot. Under protest and to avoid foreclosure, the Leech
Lake Band paid more than $64,000 in taxes, interest, andpenalties.

In 1995, the Band filed suit in federal court seeking a de-claratory judgment that Cass County could not tax the 21
parcels.1 The District Court granted summary judgment infavor of Cass County, holding that all of the land that had
been alienated from tribal ownership under the Nelson Actwas taxable. 908 F. Supp. 689 (Minn. 1995). The District
Court interpreted our decision in Yakima to mean that "ifCongress has made Indian land freely alienable, states may
tax the land"--that is, "alienability equals taxability." 908F. Supp., at 693.

A divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals forthe Eighth Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part.

CHIPPEWA INDIANS

Opinion of the Court

majority held that the 13 parcels allotted to individual Indi-ans under $ 3 of the Nelson Act could be taxed so long as

the District Court confirmed on remand that they had beenpatented after passage of the Burke Act proviso, because the
explicit mention of "taxation" in the proviso manifested thenecessary "unmistakably clear" intent.

Id., at 827, 829-830.But the panel majority further held that the eight parcels

sold as pine lands or homestead land under $$ 4-6 of the Nel-son Act could not be taxed because those sections, "unlike

$ 3, did not incorporate the GAA or include any mention ofan intent to tax lands distributed under them which might
become reacquired by the Band in fee." Id., at 829.Judge Magill concurred with the majority on the taxability
of the 13 allotted parcels, but he dissented from the holdingthat the remaining 8 parcels were not also taxable. In his
view, Yakima propounded "the clear rule . . . that alienabilityallows taxation." 108 F. 3d, at 831.

We granted certiorari, 522 U. S. 944 (1997), to decidewhether Cass County may impose its ad valorem property
tax on the seven parcels sold as pine lands and the one soldas a homestead to non-Indians.

Opinion of the Court
such an intent when it has authorized reservation lands tobe allotted in fee to individual Indians, thus making the lands

freely alienable and withdrawing them from federal protec-tion. This was the case in both Yakima and Goudy v.
Meath, 203 U. S. 146 (1906), in which this Court held thatland, allotted and patented in fee to individual Indians and
thus rendered freely alienable after the expiration of federaltrust status, was subject to county ad valorem taxes even
though it was within a reservation and held by either indi-vidual Indians or a tribe.

In Goudy, Congress had made reservation land alienableby authorizing the President to issue patents to individual
members of the Puyallup Tribe. The President issued sucha patent to the plaintiff shortly before Washington became a
State. The treaty of March 16, 1854, between the UnitedStates and the Puyallup Tribe, 10 Stat. 1043, provided that
such fee-patented land "shall be exempt from levy, sale, orforfeiture" until a state constitution was adopted and the
state legislature removed the restrictions with Congress'consent. When Washington became a State, its legislature
passed a law authorizing the sale of reservation lands;shortly thereafter, Congress authorized the appointment of
a commission with the power to superintend the sale of thoselands, with the proviso that "the Indian allottees shall not
have power of alienation of the allotted lands not selectedfor sale by said Commission for a period of ten years from
the date of the passage of this act." 27 Stat. 633 (1893).When the 10-year period expired, the county levied an ad
valorem tax on the land. This Court held that the tax waspermissible because the land was freely alienable. Goudy v.
Meath, 203 U. S., at 149-150. Although the Indian patentowner argued that there had been no express repeal of the
exemption provided by the 1854 treaty, this Court statedthat such an express repeal was unnecessary:

"That Congress may grant the power of voluntary sale,while withholding the land from taxation or forced alien524US1 Unit: $U77 [09-06-00 18:33:45] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court

ation may be conceded. . . . But while Congress maymake such provision, its intent to do so should be clearly

manifested." Id, at 149.
The Goudy Court concluded that it would "seem strange [forCongress] to withdraw [federal] protection and permit the

Indian to dispose of his lands as he pleases, while at the sametime releasing [the lands] from taxation."

Ibid. Indeed,because such congressional purpose would be unreasonable,

Congress would have to "clearly manifest" such a contrarypurpose in order to counteract the consequence of taxability
that ordinarily flows from alienability. Ibid.In

Yakima, we considered whether the GAA manifestedan unmistakably clear intent to allow state and local taxation

of reservation lands allotted under the GAA and owned infee by either the Yakima Indian Nation or individual Indians.3 In holding that the lands could be taxed, we notedthat the Burke Act proviso clearly manifested such an intent
by expressly addressing the taxability of fee-patented land.502 U. S., at 259. We also indicated that the alienability of
allotted lands itself, as provided by $ 5 of the GAA, similarlymanifested an unmistakably clear intent to allow taxation.

4

We reasoned that Goudy, "without even mentioning the

3 We are concerned here only with Yakima's holding with respect to ad
valorem taxes such as those at issue in this case. Yakima also held that
the GAA did not authorize the county to impose an excise tax on the sale
of land held by individual Indians or by the tribe, because such a tax did
not constitute the "taxation of land." See County of Yakima v. Confederated Tribes and Bands of Yakima Nation, 502 U. S. 251, 268-269 (1992).
That holding, however, is not relevant to this case, which involves only an
ad valorem tax on land itself, rather than an excise tax on a transaction.

4 The Burke Act proviso, as noted, see supra, at 107, did not itself authorize taxation of fee-patented land; it merely altered the result of In re Heff,
197 U. S. 488 (1905), as to when parcels allotted to the Indians could be
alienated and taxed. In re Heff had held this occurred as soon as allotted
lands were patented to the Indians in trust (during which the land would
still be under the protection of the Federal Government); the Burke Act
proviso stated that this did not occur until the lands were patented in fee.

Opinion of the Court
Burke Act proviso," 502 U. S., at 259, had held that state taxlaws applied to the Indian allottee at the expiration of the

trust period: "[I]t was the alienability of the allotted lands. . . that the

[Goudy] Court found of central significance."
Id., at 263 (emphasis deleted). And we reiterated Goudy's
point that, although it is possible for Congress to render res-ervation land alienable and still forbid States to tax it, this

unlikely arrangement would not be presumed unless Con-gress "clearly manifested" such an intent. 502 U. S., at 263
(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).The Court of Appeals thus erred in concluding that our
holding in Yakima turned on the Burke Act proviso's express
reference to taxability. Yakima, like Goudy, stands for the
proposition that when Congress makes reservation lands
freely alienable, it is "unmistakably clear" that Congress intends that land to be taxable by state and local governments,
unless a contrary intent is "clearly manifested." 502 U. S.,
at 263.

The foregoing principle controls the disposition of this
case. In $$ 5 and 6 of the Nelson Act, Congress provided for
the public sale of pine lands and agricultural "homestead"
lands by the Federal Government to non-Indians. Congress
thereby removed that reservation land from federal protection and made it fully alienable. Under Goudy and Yakima,
therefore, it is taxable. Indeed, this conclusion flows a fortiori from Goudy and Yakima: Those cases establish that Congress clearly intended reservation lands conveyed in fee to
Indians to be subject to taxation; hence Congress surely intended reservation lands conveyed in fee to non-Indians also
to be taxable. The Court of Appeals' contrary holding attributes to Congress the odd intent that parcels conveyed to
Indians are to assume taxable status, while parcels sold to
the general public are to remain tax exempt.

The Band essentially argues that, although its tax immunity lay dormant during the period when the eight parcels
were held by non-Indians, its reacquisition of the lands in

CHIPPEWA INDIANS

Opinion of the Court

fee rendered them nontaxable once again. We reject thiscontention. As explained, once Congress has demonstrated

(as it has here) a clear intent to subject the land to taxationby making it alienable, Congress must make an unmistakably clear statement in order to render it nontaxable. See
County of Yakima v. Confederated Tribes and Bands of
Yakima Nation, 502 U. S., at 263 (citing Goudy v. Meath,
supra, at 149). The subsequent repurchase of reservationland by a tribe does not manifest any congressional intent to

reassume federal protection of that land and to oust statetaxing authority--particularly when Congress explicitly relinquished such protection many years before.Further, if we were to accept the Leech Lake Band's argument, it would render partially superfluous $ 465 of the Indian Reorganization Act. That section grants the Secretaryof the Interior authority to place land in trust, to be held by

the Federal Government for the benefit of the Indians andto be exempt from state and local taxation after assuming
such status:

"The Secretary of the Interior is authorized, in his
discretion, to acquire, through purchase, relinquishment,gift, exchange, or assignment, and interest in lands . . .

within or without existing reservations . . . for the pur-pose of providing land for Indians. . . .

"Title to any lands . . . shall be taken in the name ofthe United States in trust for the Indian tribe or individual Indian for which the land is acquired, and such lands
. . . shall be exempt from State and local taxation." 25U. S. C. $ 465.

In $ 465, therefore, Congress has explicitly set forth a procedure by which lands held by Indian tribes may become tax
exempt. It would render this procedure unnecessary, as far
as exemption from taxation is concerned, if we held that taxexempt status automatically attaches when a tribe acquires
reservation land. The Leech Lake Band apparently realizes

this, because in 1995 it successfully applied to the Secretaryof the Interior under $ 465 to restore federal trust status to

seven of the eight parcels at issue here. See Complaint || 18and Affidavit of Joseph F. Halloran in support of Plaintiff 's
Motion for Summary Judgment, in Civ. No. 5-95-99, || V (DCMinn.); Tr. of Oral Arg. 9.

* * *
When Congress makes Indian reservation land freelyalienable, it manifests an unmistakably clear intent to render

such land subject to state and local taxation. The re-purchase of such land by an Indian tribe does not cause the
land to reassume tax-exempt status. The eight parcels atissue here were therefore taxable unless and until they were
restored to federal trust protection under $ 465. The judg-ment of the Court of Appeals with respect to those lands
is reversed. It is so ordered.

5 The Leech Lake Band and the United States, as amicus, also argue
that the parcels at issue here are not alienable--and therefore not taxable--under the terms of the Indian Nonintercourse Act, which provides:
"No purchase, grant, lease, or other conveyance of lands . . . from any
Indian nation or tribe . . . shall be of any validity in law or equity, unless
the same be made by treaty or convention entered into pursuant to the
Constitution." 25 U. S. C. $ 177.

This Court has never determined whether the Indian Nonintercourse
Act, which was enacted in 1834, applies to land that has been rendered
alienable by Congress and later reacquired by an Indian tribe. Because
the parcels at issue here are not alienable--and therefore not taxable--
under the terms of the Indian Nonintercourse Act, which provides: "No
taxation if it remains freely alienable", and because it was not addressed
by the Court of Appeals, we decline to consider it for the first time in this
Court. See, e. g., Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Epstein, 516 U. S. 367,
379, n. 5 (1996) (declining to address issue both because it was "outside
the scope of the question presented in this Court" and because "we generally do not address arguments that were not the basis for the decision
below").

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe district of columbia circuit

No. 97-704. Argued April 27, 1998--Decided June 8, 1998
The Death on the High Seas Act (DOHSA or Act) allows certain relatives

of a decedent to sue for their own pecuniary losses, but does not authorize recovery for the decedent's pre-death pain and suffering. Petitioners, personal representatives of three passengers killed when Korean
Air Lines Flight KE007 was shot down over the Sea of Japan, sued
respondent airline (KAL) for, inter alia, damages for their decedents'
pre-death pain and suffering. While their suit was pending, this Court
decided in Zicherman v. Korean Air Lines Co., 516 U. S. 217--which
arose out of the same disaster--that the Warsaw Convention permits
compensation only for legally cognizable harm, but leaves the specification of what constitutes such harm to applicable domestic law, id., at
231; that DOHSA supplies the applicable United States law where an
airplane crashes on the high seas, ibid.; and that where DOHSA applies,
neither state nor general maritime law can permit recovery of loss-ofsociety damages, id., at 230. Subsequently, the District Court in this
case granted KAL's motion to dismiss petitioners' nonpecuniary damages claims on the ground that DOHSA does not permit recovery for
such damages, including damages for a decedent's pre-death pain and
suffering. In affirming, the Court of Appeals rejected petitioners' argument that general maritime law provides a survival action for pain
and suffering damages, holding that Congress has decided who may sue
and for what in cases of death on the high seas.

Held: Because Congress has chosen not to authorize a survival action for

a decedent's pre-death pain and suffering in a case of death on the high
seas, there can be no general maritime survival action for such damages.
Before Congress enacted DOHSA, admiralty law did not permit an action to recover damages for a person's death. In DOHSA, Congress
authorized such a cause of action for certain surviving relatives in cases
of death on the high seas, 46 U. S. C. App. $ 761, but limited recovery to
the survivors' own pecuniary losses, $ 762. DOHSA's limited survival
provision also restricts recovery to the survivors' pecuniary losses.

Syllabus
held that, in a case of death on the high seas, a decedent's survivors
could not recover damages under general maritime law for their loss of
society, reasoning that, since DOHSA announced Congress' considered
judgment on, inter alia, beneficiaries, survival, and damages, id., at 625,
the Court had no authority to substitute its views for those expressed
by Congress, id., at 626. Because Higginbotham involved only the
scope of the remedies available in a wrongful-death action, it did not
address the availability of other causes of action. However, petitioners
err in contending that DOHSA is a wrongful-death statute with no bearing on the availability of a survival action. By authorizing only certain
surviving relatives to recover damages, and by limiting damages to
those relatives' pecuniary losses, Congress provided the exclusive recovery for deaths on the high seas. Petitioners concede that their action
would expand the class of beneficiaries entitled to recovery and the recoverable damages; but Congress has already decided these issues and,
thus, has precluded the judiciary from expanding either category.
DOHSA's survival provision confirms the Act's comprehensive scope by
expressing Congress' considered judgment on the availability and contours of a survival action in cases of death on the high seas. Congress
has simply chosen to adopt a more limited survival provision than that
urged by petitioners. Indeed, Congress did so in the same year that it
incorporated a survival action similar to the one petitioners seek into
the Jones Act, permitting seamen to recover damages for their own
injuries. In the exercise of its admiralty jurisdiction, the Court will
not upset the balance Congress struck by authorizing a cause of action
with which Congress was certainly familiar but nonetheless declined to
adopt. Pp. 121-124.

118 DOOLEY v. KOREAN AIR LINES CO.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.
In a case of death on the high seas, the Death on the HighSeas Act, 46 U. S. C. App. $ 761

et seq., allows certain rela-tives of the decedent to sue for their pecuniary losses, but

does not authorize recovery for the decedent's pre-death painand suffering. This case presents the question whether
those relatives may nevertheless recover such damagesthrough a survival action under general maritime law. We
hold that they may not. I

On September 1, 1983, Korean Air Lines Flight KE007,en route from Anchorage, Alaska, to Seoul, South Korea,
strayed into the airspace of the former Soviet Union and wasshot down over the Sea of Japan. All 269 people on board
were killed.Petitioners, the personal representatives of three of the
passengers, brought lawsuits against respondent Korean AirLines Co., Ltd. (KAL), in the United States District Court
for the District of Columbia. These cases were consolidatedin that court, along with the other federal actions arising
out of the crash. After trial, a jury found that KAL hadcommitted "willful misconduct," thus removing the Warsaw
Convention's $75,000 cap on damages, and in a subsequentverdict awarded $50 million in punitive damages. The
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheldthe finding of willful misconduct, but vacated the punitive
damages award on the ground that the Warsaw Conventiondoes not permit the recovery of punitive damages.

In reKorean Air Lines Disaster of Sept. 1, 1983, 932 F. 2d 1475,

cert. denied, 502 U. S. 994 (1991).The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation thereafter
remanded, for damages trials, all of the individual cases tothe District Courts in which they had been filed. In petitioners' cases, KAL moved for a pretrial determination thatthe Death on the High Seas Act (DOHSA or Act), 46 U. S. C.

Opinion of the Court
App. $ 761 et seq., provides the exclusive source of recover-able damages. DOHSA provides, in relevant part:

"Whenever the death of a person shall be caused bywrongful act, neglect, or default occurring on the high
seas beyond a marine league from the shore of anyState, or the District of Columbia, or the Territories or
dependencies of the United States, the personal repre-sentative of the decedent may maintain a suit for damages in the district courts of the United States, in admi-ralty, for the exclusive benefit of the decedent's wife,
husband, parent, child, or dependent relative . . . ."

$ 761."The recovery in such suit shall be a fair and just compensation for the pecuniary loss sustained by the per-sons for whose benefit the suit is brought . . . ." $ 762.

KAL argued that, in a case of death on the high seas,DOHSA provides the exclusive cause of action and does not
permit damages for loss of society, survivors' grief, and dece-dents' pre-death pain and suffering. The District Court for
the District of Columbia disagreed, holding that because
petitioners' claims were brought pursuant to the Warsaw
Convention, DOHSA could not limit the recoverable damages. The court determined that Article 17 of the Warsaw
Convention "allows for the recovery of all `damages sustained,' " meaning any "actual harm" that any party "experienced" as a result of the crash. App. 59.

While petitioners' cases were awaiting damages trials, we
reached a different conclusion in Zicherman v. Korean Air
Lines Co., 516 U. S. 217 (1996), another case arising out of
the downing of Flight KE007. In Zicherman, we held that
the Warsaw Convention "permit[s] compensation only for legally cognizable harm, but leave[s] the specification of what
harm is legally cognizable to the domestic law applicable
under the forum's choice-of-law rules," and that where "an

airplane crash occurs on the high seas, DOHSA supplies thesubstantive United States law." Id., at 231. Accordingly,

the petitioners could not recover damages for loss of society:"[W]here DOHSA applies, neither state law, see Offshore
Logistics, Inc. v. Tallentire, 477 U. S. 207, 232-233 (1986), norgeneral maritime law, see

Mobil Oil Corp. v. Higginbotham,436 U. S. 618, 625-626 (1978), can provide a basis for recovery

of loss-of-society damages." Id., at 230. We did not decide,however, whether the petitioners in Zicherman could recover for their decedents' pre-death pain and suffering, asKAL had not raised this issue in its petition for certiorari.
See id., at 230, n. 4.After the

Zicherman decision, KAL again moved to dis-miss all of petitioners' claims for nonpecuniary damages.

The District Court granted this motion, holding that UnitedStates law (not South Korean law) governed these cases; that
DOHSA provides the applicable United States law; and thatDOHSA does not permit the recovery of nonpecuniary damages--including petitioners' claims for their decedents' pre-death pain and suffering.

In re Korean Air Lines Disasterof Sept. 1, 1983, 935 F. Supp. 10, 12-15 (1996).

On appeal, petitioners argued that, although DOHSA doesnot itself permit recovery for a decedent's pre-death pain and
suffering, general maritime law provides a survival actionthat allows a decedent's estate to recover for injuries (including pre-death pain and suffering) suffered by the decedent.The Court of Appeals rejected this argument and affirmed.
In re Korean Air Lines Disaster of Sept. 1, 1983, 117 F. 3d1477 (CADC 1997). Assuming,

arguendo, that there is asurvival cause of action under general maritime law, the

court held that such an action is unavailable when the deathis on the high seas:

"For deaths on the high seas, Congress decided who maysue and for what. Judge-made general maritime law
may not override such congressional judgments, how-ever ancient those judgments may happen to be. Con524US1 Unit: $U78 [09-06-00 18:35:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
gress made the law and it is up to Congress to changeit." Id., at 1481.

We granted certiorari, 522 U. S. 1038 (1998), to resolve aCircuit split concerning the availability of a general maritime
survival action in cases of death on the high seas. Compare,e. g., In re Korean Air Lines Disaster, 117 F. 3d, at 1481,
with Gray v. Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Co., 125 F. 3d1371, 1385 (CA11 1997).

II
Before Congress enacted DOHSA in 1920, the general lawof admiralty permitted a person injured by tortious conduct

to sue for damages, but did not permit an action to bebrought when the person was killed by that conduct. See
generally R. Hughes, Handbook of Admiralty Law 222-223(2d ed. 1920). This rule stemmed from the theory that a
right of action was personal to the victim and thus expiredwhen the victim died. Accordingly, in the absence of an Act
of Congress or state statute providing a right of action, asuit in admiralty could not be maintained in the courts of the
United States to recover damages for a person's death. See
The Harrisburg, 119 U. S. 199, 213 (1886); The Alaska, 130U. S. 201, 209 (1889).

Congress passed such a statute, and thus authorized re-covery for deaths on the high seas, with its enactment of

DOHSA. DOHSA provides a cause of action for "the deathof a person . . . caused by wrongful act, neglect, or default
occurring on the high seas," $ 761; this action must bebrought by the decedent's personal representative "for the
exclusive benefit of the decedent's wife, husband, parent,

1 We later rejected this rule in Moragne v. States Marine Lines, Inc.,
398 U. S. 375, 408-409 (1970), by overruling The Harrisburg, 119 U. S. 199
(1886), and holding that a federal remedy for wrongful death exists under
general maritime law. In Sea-Land Services, Inc. v. Gaudet, 414 U. S.
573, 574 (1974), we further held that such wrongful-death awards could
include compensation for loss of support and services and for loss of
society.

Opinion of the Court
child, or dependent relative," ibid. The Act limits recoveryin such a suit to "a fair and just compensation for the pecuniary loss sustained by the persons for whose benefit the suitis sought." $ 762. DOHSA also includes a limited survival
provision: In situations in which a person injured on the high
seas sues for his injuries and then dies prior to completionof the suit, "the personal representative of the decedent may

be substituted as a party and the suit may proceed as a suitunder this chapter for the recovery of the compensation
provided in section 762." $ 765. Other sections establish alimitations period, $ 763a, govern actions under foreign law,

$ 764, bar contributory negligence as a complete defense,

$ 766, exempt the Great Lakes, navigable waters in the Panama Canal Zone, and state territorial waters from the Act's
coverage, $ 767, and preserve certain state-law remedies and
state-court jurisdiction, ibid. DOHSA does not authorize
recovery for the decedent's own losses, nor does it allow
damages for nonpecuniary losses.

In Mobil Oil Corp. v. Higginbotham, 436 U. S. 618 (1978),
we considered whether, in a case of death on the high seas,
a decedent's survivors could recover damages under general
maritime law for their loss of society. We held that they
could not, and thus limited to territorial waters those cases
in which we had permitted loss of society damages under
general maritime law. Id., at 622-624; see n. 1, supra. For
deaths on the high seas, DOHSA "announces Congress'
considered judgment on such issues as the beneficiaries, the
limitations period, contributory negligence, survival, and
damages." 436 U. S., at 625. We thus noted that while
we could "fil[l] a gap left by Congress' silence," we were
not free to "rewrit[e] rules that Congress has affirmatively
and specifically enacted." Ibid. Because "Congress ha[d]
struck the balance for us" in DOHSA by limiting the available recovery to pecuniary losses suffered by surviving relatives, id., at 623, we had "no authority to substitute our
views for those expressed by Congress," id., at 626. Hig524US1 Unit: $U78 [09-06-00 18:35:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN

123Cite as: 524 U. S. 116 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
ginbotham, however, involved only the scope of the remedies
available in a wrongful-death action, and thus did not address the availability of other causes of action.

Conceding that DOHSA does not authorize recovery for a
decedent's pre-death pain and suffering, petitioners seek to
recover such damages through a general maritime survival
action. Petitioners argue that general maritime law recognizes a survival action, which permits a decedent's estate
to recover damages that the decedent would have been
able to recover but for his death, including pre-death pain
and suffering. And, they contend, because DOHSA is a
wrongful-death statute--giving surviving relatives a cause
of action for losses they suffered as a result of the decedent's
death--it has no bearing on the availability of a survival
action.

We disagree. DOHSA expresses Congress' judgment
that there should be no such cause of action in cases of death
on the high seas. By authorizing only certain surviving relatives to recover damages, and by limiting damages to the
pecuniary losses sustained by those relatives, Congress provided the exclusive recovery for deaths that occur on the
high seas. Petitioners concede that their proposed survival
action would necessarily expand the class of beneficiaries in
cases of death on the high seas by permitting decedents' estates (and their various beneficiaries) to recover compensation. They further concede that their cause of action would
expand the recoverable damages for deaths on the high seas
by permitting the recovery of nonpecuniary losses, such as
pre-death pain and suffering. Because Congress has already decided these issues, it has precluded the judiciary
from enlarging either the class of beneficiaries or the recoverable damages. As we noted in Higginbotham, "Congress
did not limit DOHSA beneficiaries to recovery of their pecuniary losses in order to encourage the creation of nonpecuniary supplements." Id., at 625.

524US1 Unit: $U78 [09-06-00 18:35:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN
124 DOOLEY v. KOREAN AIR LINES CO.

Opinion of the Court
The comprehensive scope of DOHSA is confirmed by itssurvival provision, see supra, at 122, which limits the recovery in such cases to the pecuniary losses suffered by surviv-ing relatives. The Act thus expresses Congress' "considered judgment," Mobil Oil Corp. v. Higginbotham, supra, at625, on the availability and contours of a survival action in
cases of death on the high seas. For this reason, it cannot becontended that DOHSA has no bearing on survival actions;
rather, Congress has simply chosen to adopt a more limitedsurvival provision. Indeed, Congress did so in the same
year that it incorporated into the Jones Act, which permitsseamen injured in the course of their employment to recover
damages for their injuries, a survival action similar to theone petitioners seek here. See Act of June 5, 1920, $ 33, 41
Stat. 1007 (incorporating survival action of the Federal Em-ployers' Liability Act, 45 U. S. C. $ 59). Even in the exercise
of our admiralty jurisdiction, we will not upset the balancestruck by Congress by authorizing a cause of action with
which Congress was certainly familiar but nonetheless de-clined to adopt.

In sum, Congress has spoken on the availability of a sur-vival action, the losses to be recovered, and the beneficiaries,
in cases of death on the high seas. Because Congress haschosen not to authorize a survival action for a decedent's
pre-death pain and suffering, there can be no general mari-time survival action for such damages.

2 The judgment of

the Court of Appeals is

Affirmed.

2 Accordingly, we need not decide whether general maritime law ever
provides a survival action.

125OCTOBER TERM, 1997
Syllabus

MUSCARELLO v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fifth circuit

No. 96-1654. Argued March 23, 1998--Decided June 8, 1998*
A person who "uses or carries a firearm" "during and in relation to" a

"drug trafficking crime" is subject to a 5-year mandatory prison term.
18 U. S. C. $ 924(c)(1). In the first case, police officers found a handgun
locked in the glove compartment of petitioner Muscarello's truck, which
he was using to transport marijuana for sale. In the second case, federal agents at a drug-sale point found drugs and guns in the trunk of
petitioners' car. In both cases, the Courts of Appeals found that petitioners had carried firearms in violation of $ 924(c)(1).

Held: The phrase "carries a firearm" applies to a person who knowingly

possesses and conveys firearms in a vehicle, including in the locked
glove compartment or trunk of a car, which the person accompanies.
Pp. 127-139.

(a) As a matter of ordinary English, one can "carry firearms" in a
wagon, car, truck, or other vehicle which one accompanies. The word's
first, or basic, meaning in dictionaries and the word's origin make clear
that "carry" includes conveying in a vehicle. The greatest of writers
have used "carry" with this meaning, as has the modern press. Contrary to the arguments of petitioners and the dissent, there is no linguistic reason to think that Congress intended to limit the word to its secondary meaning, which suggests support rather than movement or
transportation, as when, for example, a column "carries" the weight of
an arch. Given the word's ordinary meaning, it is not surprising that
the Federal Courts of Appeals have unanimously concluded that "carry"
is not limited to the carrying of weapons directly on the person but can
include their carriage in a car. Pp. 127-132.

(b) Neither the statute's basic purpose--to combat the "dangerous
combination" of "drugs and guns," Smith v. United States, 508 U. S. 223,
240--nor its legislative history supports circumscribing the scope of the
word "carry" by applying an "on the person" limitation. Pp. 132-134.

(c) Petitioners' remaining arguments to the contrary--that the definition adopted here obliterates the statutory distinction between
"carry" and "transport," a word used in other provisions of the "fire*Together with No. 96-8837, Cleveland et al. v. United States, on certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.

arms" section of the United States Code; that it would be anomalous to
construe "carry" broadly when the related phrase "uses . . . a firearm,"
18 U. S. C. $ 924(c)(1), has been construed narrowly to include only the
"active employment" of a firearm, Bailey v. United States, 516 U. S. 137,
144; that this Court's reading of the statute would extend its coverage
to passengers on buses, trains, or ships, who have placed a firearm, say,
in checked luggage; and that the "rule of lenity" should apply because
of statutory ambiguity--are unconvincing. Pp. 134-139.

who "uses or carries a firearm" "during and in relation to" a"drug trafficking crime." 18 U. S. C. $ 924(c)(1). The question before us is whether the phrase "carries a firearm" islimited to the carrying of firearms on the person. We hold

Opinion of the Court
who knowingly possesses and conveys firearms in a vehicle,including in the locked glove compartment or trunk of a car,

which the person accompanies.

I
The question arises in two cases, which we have consoli-dated for argument. Petitioner in the first case, Frank J.

Muscarello, unlawfully sold marijuana, which he carried inhis truck to the place of sale. Police officers found a handgun locked in the truck's glove compartment. During pleaproceedings, Muscarello admitted that he had "carried" the
gun "for protection in relation" to the drug offense, App.in No. 96-1654, p. 12, though he later claimed to the contrary, and added that, in any event, his "carr[ying]" of thegun in the glove compartment did not fall within the scope
of the statutory word "carries." App. to Pet. for Cert. inNo. 96-1654, p. 10a.

Petitioners in the second case, Donald Cleveland and En-rique Gray-Santana, placed several guns in a bag, put the
bag in the trunk of a car, and then traveled by car to a pro-posed drug-sale point, where they intended to steal drugs
from the sellers. Federal agents at the scene stopped them,searched the cars, found the guns and drugs, and arrested
them.In both cases the Courts of Appeals found that petitioners
had "carrie[d]" the guns during and in relation to a drugtrafficking offense. 106 F. 3d 636, 639 (CA5 1997); 106 F. 3d
1056, 1068 (CA1 1997). We granted certiorari to determinewhether the fact that the guns were found in the locked
glove compartment, or the trunk, of a car precludes applica-tion of $ 924(c)(1). We conclude that it does not.

II

A

We begin with the statute's language. The parties vigor-ously contest the ordinary English meaning of the phrase

524US1 Unit: $U79 [09-08-00 13:44:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN
128 MUSCARELLO v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
"carries a firearm." Because they essentially agree that
Congress intended the phrase to convey its ordinary, and not
some special legal, meaning, and because they argue the linguistic point at length, we too have looked into the matter
in more than usual depth. Although the word "carry" has
many different meanings, only two are relevant here. When
one uses the word in the first, or primary, meaning, one can,
as a matter of ordinary English, "carry firearms" in a wagon,
car, truck, or other vehicle that one accompanies. When one
uses the word in a different, rather special, way, to mean, for
example, "bearing" or (in slang) "packing" (as in "packing a
gun"), the matter is less clear. But, for reasons we shall set
out below, we believe Congress intended to use the word in
its primary sense and not in this latter, special way.

Consider first the word's primary meaning. The Oxford
English Dictionary gives as its first definition "convey, originally by cart or wagon, hence in any vehicle, by ship, on
horseback, etc." 2 Oxford English Dictionary 919 (2d ed.
1989); see also Webster's Third New International Dictionary 343 (1986) (first definition: "move while supporting (as in
a vehicle or in one's hands or arms)"); Random House Dictionary of the English Language Unabridged 319 (2d ed.
1987) (first definition: "to take or support from one place to
another; convey; transport").

The origin of the word "carries" explains why the first, or
basic, meaning of the word "carry" includes conveyance in a
vehicle. See Barnhart Dictionary of Etymology 146 (1988)
(tracing the word from Latin "carum," which means "car" or
"cart"); 2 Oxford English Dictionary, supra, at 919 (tracing
the word from Old French "carier" and the late Latin "carricare," which meant to "convey in a car"); Oxford Dictionary
of English Etymology 148 (C. Onions ed. 1966) (same); Barnhart Dictionary of Etymology, supra, at 143 (explaining that
the term "car" has been used to refer to the automobile
since 1896).

129Cite as: 524 U. S. 125 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
The greatest of writers have used the word with this
meaning. See, e. g., The King James Bible, 2 Kings 9:28
("[H]is servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem"); id.,
Isaiah 30:6 ("[T]hey will carry their riches upon the shoulders of young asses"). Robinson Crusoe says, "[w]ith my
boat, I carry'd away every Thing." D. Defoe, Robinson
Crusoe 174 (J. Crowley ed. 1972). And the owners of Queequeg's ship, Melville writes, "had lent him a [wheelbarrow],
in which to carry his heavy chest to his boarding-house."
H. Melville, Moby Dick 43 (U. Chicago 1952). This Court,
too, has spoken of the "carrying" of drugs in a car or in
its "trunk." California v. Acevedo, 500 U. S. 565, 572-573
(1991); Florida v. Jimeno, 500 U. S. 248, 249 (1991).

These examples do not speak directly about carrying guns.
But there is nothing linguistically special about the fact that
weapons, rather than drugs, are being carried. Robinson
Crusoe might have carried a gun in his boat; Queequeg might
have borrowed a wheelbarrow in which to carry not a chest
but a harpoon. And, to make certain that there is no special
ordinary English restriction (unmentioned in dictionaries)
upon the use of "carry" in respect to guns, we have surveyed
modern press usage, albeit crudely, by searching computerized newspaper data bases--both the New York Times data
base in Lexis/Nexis, and the "US News" data base in Westlaw. We looked for sentences in which the words "carry,"
"vehicle," and "weapon" (or variations thereof) all appear.
We found thousands of such sentences, and random sampling
suggests that many, perhaps more than one-third, are sentences used to convey the meaning at issue here, i. e., the
carrying of guns in a car.

The New York Times, for example, writes about "an
ex-con" who "arrives home driving a stolen car and carrying
a load of handguns," Mar. 21, 1992, section 1, p. 18, col. 1, and
an "official peace officer who carries a shotgun in his boat,"
June 19, 1988, section 12WC, p. 2, col. 1; cf. The New York

130 MUSCARELLO v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
Times Manual of Style and Usage, a Desk Book of Guidelinesfor Writers and Editors, foreword (L. Jordan rev. ed. 1976)

(restricting Times journalists and editors to the use ofproper English). The Boston Globe refers to the arrest of a
professional baseball player "for carrying a semiloaded automatic weapon in his car." Dec. 10, 1994, p. 75, col. 5. TheColorado Springs Gazette Telegraph speaks of one "Russell"

who "carries a gun hidden in his car." May 2, 1993, p. B1,col. 2. The Arkansas Gazette refers to a "house" that was
"searched" in an effort to find "items that could be carriedin a car, such as . . . guns." Mar. 10, 1991, p. A1, col. 2. The
San Diego Union-Tribune asks, "What, do they carry gunsaboard these boats now?" Feb. 18, 1992, p. D2, col. 5.

Now consider a different, somewhat special meaning of the
word "carry"--a meaning upon which the linguistic argu-ments of petitioners and the dissent must rest. The Oxford

English Dictionary's twenty-sixth definition of "carry" is"bear, wear, hold up, or sustain, as one moves about; habitually to bear about with one." 2 Oxford English Dictionary,at 921. Webster's defines "carry" as "to move while supporting," not just in a vehicle, but also "in one's handsor arms." Webster's Third New International Dictionary,
supra, at 343. And Black's Law Dictionary defines the entire phrase "carry arms or weapons" as

"To wear, bear or carry them upon the person or in theclothing or in a pocket, for the purpose of use, or for

the purpose of being armed and ready for offensive or
defensive action in case of a conflict with another per-son." Black's Law Dictionary 214 (6th ed. 1990).

These special definitions, however, do not purport to limit
the "carrying of arms" to the circumstances they describe.
No one doubts that one who bears arms on his person "carries a weapon." But to say that is not to deny that one may
also "carry a weapon" tied to the saddle of a horse or placed
in a bag in a car.

Opinion of the Court
Nor is there any linguistic reason to think that Congressintended to limit the word "carries" in the statute to any of

these special definitions. To the contrary, all these specialdefinitions embody a form of an important, but secondary,
meaning of "carry," a meaning that suggests support rather
than movement or transportation, as when, for example, acolumn "carries" the weight of an arch. 2 Oxford English

Dictionary, at 919, 921. In this sense a gangster might"carry" a gun (in colloquial language, he might "pack a gun")
even though he does not move from his chair. It is difficultto believe, however, that Congress intended to limit the statutory word to this definition--imposing special punishment
upon the comatose gangster while ignoring drug lords who
drive to a sale carrying an arsenal of weapons in their van.

We recognize, as the dissent emphasizes, that the word
"carry" has other meanings as well. But those other meanings (e. g., "carry all he knew," "carries no colours"), see post,
at 143-144, are not relevant here. And the fact that speakers often do not add to the phrase "carry a gun" the words
"in a car" is of no greater relevance here than the fact that
millions of Americans did not see Muscarello carry a gun in
his truck. The relevant linguistic facts are that the word
"carry" in its ordinary sense includes carrying in a car and
that the word, used in its ordinary sense, keeps the same
meaning whether one carries a gun, a suitcase, or a banana.

Given the ordinary meaning of the word "carry," it is not
surprising to find that the Federal Courts of Appeals have
unanimously concluded that "carry" is not limited to the carrying of weapons directly on the person but can include their
carriage in a car. United States v. Toms, 136 F. 3d 176, 181
(CADC 1998); United States v. Foster, 133 F. 3d 704, 708

B
We now explore more deeply the purely legal question ofwhether Congress intended to use the word "carry" in its

ordinary sense, or whether it intended to limit the scope ofthe phrase to instances in which a gun is carried "on the
person." We conclude that neither the statute's basic pur-pose nor its legislative history support circumscribing the
scope of the word "carry" by applying an "on the person"limitation.

This Court has described the statute's basic purposebroadly, as an effort to combat the "dangerous combination"
of "drugs and guns." Smith v. United States, 508 U. S. 223,240 (1993). And the provision's chief legislative sponsor has
said that the provision seeks "to persuade the man who istempted to commit a Federal felony to leave his gun at
home." 114 Cong. Rec. 22231 (1968) (Rep. Poff); see Busicv.

United States, 446 U. S. 398, 405 (1980) (describing Poff 'scomments as "crucial material" in interpreting the purpose

of $ 924(c)); Simpson v. United States, 435 U. S. 6, 13-14(1978) (concluding that Poff 's comments are "clearly probative" and "certainly entitled to weight"); see also 114 Cong.Rec. 22243-22244 (statutes would apply to "the man who
goes out taking a gun to commit a crime") (Rep. Hunt); id.,at 22244 ("Of course, what we are trying to do by these penalties is to persuade the criminal to leave his gun at home")(Rep. Randall);

id., at 22236 ("We are concerned . . . withhaving the criminal leave his gun at home") (Rep. Meskill).

From the perspective of any such purpose (persuading acriminal "to leave his gun at home"), what sense would it

Opinion of the Court
make for this statute to penalize one who walks with a gunin a bag to the site of a drug sale, but to ignore a similar

individual who, like defendant Gray-Santana, travels to asimilar site with a similar gun in a similar bag, but instead
of walking, drives there with the gun in his car? How persuasive is a punishment that is without effect until a drugdealer who has brought his gun to a sale (indeed has it available for use) actually takes it from the trunk (or unlocks theglove compartment) of his car? It is difficult to say that,
considered as a class, those who prepare, say, to sell drugsby placing guns in their cars are less dangerous, or less deserving of punishment, than those who carry handguns on
their person.

We have found no significant indication elsewhere in the
legislative history of any more narrowly focused relevant
purpose. We have found an instance in which a legislator
referred to the statute as applicable when an individual "has
a firearm on his person," ibid. (Rep. Meskill); an instance in
which a legislator speaks of "a criminal who takes a gun in
his hand," id., at 22239 (Rep. Pucinski); and a reference in
the Senate Report to a "gun carried in a pocket," S. Rep.
No. 98-225, p. 314, n. 10 (1983); see also 114 Cong. Rec. 21788,
21789 (1968) (references to gun "carrying" without more).
But in these instances no one purports to define the scope of
the term "carries"; and the examples of guns carried on the
person are not used to illustrate the reach of the term "carries" but to illustrate, or to criticize, a different aspect of
the statute.

Regardless, in other instances, legislators suggest that the
word "carries" has a broader scope. One legislator indicates
that the statute responds in part to the concerns of law enforcement personnel, who had urged that "carrying short
firearms in motor vehicles be classified as carrying such
weapons concealed." Id., at 22242 (Rep. May). Another
criticizes a version of the proposed statute by suggesting it
might apply to drunken driving, and gives as an example a

Opinion of the Court
drunken driver who has a "gun in his car." Id., at 21792(Rep. Yates). Others describe the statute as criminalizing

gun "possession"--a term that could stretch beyond both the"use" of a gun and the carrying of a gun on the person. See
id., at 21793 (Rep. Casey); id., at 22236 (Rep. Meskill); id., at30584 (Rep. Collier);

id., at 30585 (Rep. Skubitz).

C
We are not convinced by petitioners' remaining argumentsto the contrary. First, they say that our definition of "carry"

makes it the equivalent of "transport." Yet, Congress else-where in related statutes used the word "transport" deliberately to signify a different, and broader, statutory coverage.The immediately preceding statutory subsection, for example, imposes a different set of penalties on one who, withan intent to commit a crime, "ships, transports, or receives
a firearm" in interstate commerce. 18 U. S. C. $ 924(b).Moreover, $ 926A specifically "entitle[s]" a person "not otherwise prohibited . . . from transporting, shipping, or receivinga firearm" to "transport a firearm . . . from any place where
he may lawfully possess and carry" it to "any other place"where he may do so. Why, petitioners ask, would Congress
have used the word "transport," or used both "carry" and"transport" in the same provision, if it had intended to obliterate the distinction between the two?The short answer is that our definition does not equate
"carry" and "transport." "Carry" implies personal agencyand some degree of possession, whereas "transport" does not
have such a limited connotation and, in addition, implies themovement of goods in bulk over great distances. See Webster's Third New International Dictionary, at 343 (notingthat "carry" means "moving to a location some distance away
while supporting or maintaining off the ground" and "is anatural word to use in ref. to cargoes and loads on trucks,
wagons, planes, ships, or even beasts of burden," while"transport refers to carriage in bulk or number over an ap524US1 Unit: $U79 [09-08-00 13:44:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
preciable distance and, typically, by a customary or usual car-rier agency"); see also Webster's Dictionary of Synonyms 141

(1942). If Smith, for example, calls a parcel delivery service,which sends a truck to Smith's house to pick up Smith's package and take it to Los Angeles, one might say that Smith
has shipped the package and the parcel delivery service hastransported the package. But only the truck driver has

"carried" the package in the sense of "carry" that we believeCongress intended. Therefore, "transport" is a broader
category that includes "carry" but also encompasses otheractivity.

The dissent refers to $ 926A and to another statute where
Congress used the word "transport" rather than "carry" to
describe the movement of firearms. 18 U. S. C. $ 925(a)
(2)(B); post, at 146-147. According to the dissent, had Congress intended "carry" to have the meaning we give it, Congress would not have needed to use a different word in these
provisions. But as we have discussed above, we believe the
word "transport" is broader than the word "carry."

And, if Congress intended "carry" to have the limited
definition the dissent contends, it would have been quite unnecessary to add the proviso in $ 926A requiring a person, to
be exempt from penalties, to store her firearm in a locked
container not immediately accessible. See $ 926A (quoted in
full, post, at 146) (exempting from criminal penalties one who
transports a firearm from a place where "he may lawfully
possess and carry such firearm" but not exempting the
"transportation" of a firearm if it is "readily accessible or is
directly accessible from the passenger compartment of such
transporting vehicle"). The statute simply could have said
that such a person may not "carry" a firearm. But, of
course, Congress did not say this because that is not what
"carry" means.

As we interpret the statutory scheme, it makes sense.
Congress has imposed a variable penalty with no mandatory
minimum sentence upon a person who "transports" (or

524US1 Unit: $U79 [09-08-00 13:44:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN
136 MUSCARELLO v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
"ships" or "receives") a firearm knowing it will be used to
commit any "offense punishable by imprisonment for [more
than] one year," $ 924(b), and it has imposed a 5-year mandatory minimum sentence upon one who "carries" a firearm
"during and in relation to" a "drug trafficking crime,"

$ 924(c). The first subsection imposes a less strict sentencing regime upon one who, say, ships firearms by mail for
use in a crime elsewhere; the latter subsection imposes a
mandatory sentence upon one who, say, brings a weapon with
him (on his person or in his car) to the site of a drug sale.

Second, petitioners point out that, in Bailey v. United
States, 516 U. S. 137 (1995), we considered the related phrase
"uses . . . a firearm" found in the same statutory provision
now before us. See 18 U. S. C. $ 924(c)(1) ("uses or carries a
firearm"). We construed the term "use" narrowly, limiting
its application to the "active employment" of a firearm. Bailey, 516 U. S., at 144. Petitioners argue that it would be
anomalous to construe broadly the word "carries," its statutory next-door neighbor.

In Bailey, however, we limited "use" of a firearm to "active
employment" in part because we assumed "that Congress
. . . intended each term to have a particular, nonsuperfluous
meaning." Id., at 146. A broader interpretation of "use,"
we said, would have swallowed up the term "carry." Ibid.
But "carry" as we interpret that word does not swallow up
the term "use." "Use" retains the same independent meaning we found for it in Bailey, where we provided examples
involving the displaying or the bartering of a gun. Ibid.
"Carry" also retains an independent meaning, for, under Bailey, carrying a gun in a car does not necessarily involve the
gun's "active employment." More importantly, having construed "use" narrowly in Bailey, we cannot also construe
"carry" narrowly without undercutting the statute's basic objective. For the narrow interpretation would remove the
act of carrying a gun in a car entirely from the statute's

524US1 Unit: $U79 [09-08-00 13:44:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
reach, leaving a gap in coverage that we do not believe Con-gress intended.

Third, petitioners say that our reading of the statutewould extend its coverage to passengers on buses, trains, or
ships, who have placed a firearm, say, in checked luggage.
To extend this statute so far, they argue, is unfair, going wellbeyond what Congress likely would have thought possible.

They add that some lower courts, thinking approximatelythe same, have limited the scope of "carries" to instances
where a gun in a car is immediately accessible, thereby mostlikely excluding from coverage a gun carried in a car's trunk
or locked glove compartment. See, e. g., Foster, 133 F. 3d,
at 708 (concluding that person "carries" a firearm in a car
only if the firearm is immediately accessible); Giraldo, 80
F. 3d, at 676 (same).

In our view, this argument does not take adequate account
of other limiting words in the statute--words that make the
statute applicable only where a defendant "carries" a gun
both "during and in relation to" a drug crime. $ 924(c)(1)
(emphasis added). Congress added these words in part to
prevent prosecution where guns "played" no part in the
crime. See S. Rep. No. 98-225, at 314, n. 10; cf. United
States v. Stewart, 779 F. 2d 538, 539 (CA9 1985) (Kennedy, J.)
(observing that " `in relation to' " was "added to allay explicitly the concern that a person could be prosecuted . . . for
committing an entirely unrelated crime while in possession
of a firearm"), overruled in part on other grounds, United
States v. Hernandez, 80 F. 3d 1253, 1257 (CA9 1996).

Once one takes account of the words "during" and "in relation to," it no longer seems beyond Congress' likely intent,
or otherwise unfair, to interpret the statute as we have done.
If one carries a gun in a car "during" and "in relation to" a
drug sale, for example, the fact that the gun is carried in
the car's trunk or locked glove compartment seems not only
logically difficult to distinguish from the immediately accessible gun, but also beside the point.

138 MUSCARELLO v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
At the same time, the narrow interpretation creates itsown anomalies. The statute, for example, defines "firearm"

to include a "bomb," "grenade," "rocket having a propellantcharge of more than four ounces," or "missile having an
explosive or incendiary charge of more than one-quarter
ounce," where such device is "explosive," "incendiary," or de-livers "poison gas." 18 U. S. C. $ 921(a)(4)(A). On petitioners' reading, the "carry" provision would not apply to in-stances where drug lords, engaged in a major transaction,
took with them "firearms" such as these, which most likelycould not be carried on the person.

Fourth, petitioners argue that we should construe theword "carry" to mean "immediately accessible." And, as we
have said, they point out that several Courts of Appeals have
limited the statute's scope in this way. See, e. g., Foster,
supra, at 708; Giraldo, supra, at 676. That interpretation,
however, is difficult to square with the statute's language,for one "carries" a gun in the glove compartment whether or

not that glove compartment is locked. Nothing in the stat-ute's history suggests that Congress intended that limitation. And, for reasons pointed out above, see supra, at 137,we believe that the words "during" and "in relation to" will
limit the statute's application to the harms that Congress
foresaw.

Finally, petitioners and the dissent invoke the "rule of lenity." The simple existence of some statutory ambiguity,
however, is not sufficient to warrant application of that rule,
for most statutes are ambiguous to some degree. Cf. Smith,
508 U. S., at 239 ("The mere possibility of articulating a narrower construction . . . does not by itself make the rule of
lenity applicable"). " `The rule of lenity applies only if,
"after seizing everything from which aid can be derived," . . .
we can make "no more than a guess as to what Congress
intended." ' " United States v. Wells, 519 U. S. 482, 499
(1997) (quoting Reno v. Koray, 515 U. S. 50, 65 (1995), in turn
quoting Smith, supra, at 239, and Ladner v. United States,
358 U. S. 169, 178 (1958)). To invoke the rule, we must con524US1 Unit: $U79 [09-08-00 13:44:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
clude that there is a " ` "grievous ambiguity or uncertainty" 'in the statute." Staples v. United States, 511 U. S. 600, 619,

n. 17 (1994) (quoting Chapman v. United States, 500 U. S.453, 463 (1991)). Certainly, our decision today is based on
much more than a "guess as to what Congress intended,"and there is no "grievous ambiguity" here. The problem of
statutory interpretation in these cases is indeed no differentfrom that in many of the criminal cases that confront us.
Yet, this Court has never held that the rule of lenity auto-matically permits a defendant to win.

In sum, the "generally accepted contemporary meaning"of the word "carry" includes the carrying of a firearm in a
vehicle. The purpose of this statute warrants its applicationin such circumstances. The limiting phrase "during and in
relation to" should prevent misuse of the statute to penalizethose whose conduct does not create the risks of harm at
which the statute aims.For these reasons, we conclude that petitioners' conduct
falls within the scope of the phrase "carries a firearm." Thejudgments of the Courts of Appeals are affirmed.

It is so ordered.
Justice Ginsburg, with whom The Chief Justice,
Justice Scalia, and Justice Souter join, dissenting.

Section 924(c)(1) of Title 18, United States Code, is apunishment-enhancing provision; it imposes a mandatory

five-year prison term when the defendant "during and in re-lation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking . . . uses
or carries a firearm." In Bailey v. United States, 516 U. S.137 (1995), this Court held that the term "uses," in the context of $ 924(c)(1), means "active employment" of the firearm.In today's cases we confront a related question: What does
the term "carries" mean in the context of $ 924(c)(1), the en-hanced punishment prescription again at issue.

It is uncontested that $ 924(c)(1) applies when the defend-ant bears a firearm,

person "for the purpose of being armed and ready for offen-sive or defensive action in case of a conflict." Black's Law

Dictionary 214 (6th ed. 1990) (defining the phrase "carryarms or weapons"); see ante, at 130. The Court holds that,
in addition, "carries a firearm," in the context of $ 924(c)(1),means personally transporting, possessing, or keeping a
firearm in a vehicle, anyplace in a vehicle.Without doubt, "carries" is a word of many meanings, definable to mean or include carting about in a vehicle. Butthat encompassing definition is not a ubiquitously necessary
one. Nor, in my judgment, is it a proper construction of"carries" as the term appears in $ 924(c)(1). In line with
Bailey and the principle of lenity the Court has long fol-lowed, I would confine "carries a firearm," for $ 924(c)(1) purposes, to the undoubted meaning of that expression in therelevant context. I would read the words to indicate not
merely keeping arms on one's premises or in one's vehicle,but bearing them in such manner as to be ready for use as
a weapon. I

I note first what is at stake for petitioners. The questionbefore the Court "is not whether possession of a gun [on the

drug offender's premises or in his car, during and in relationto commission of the offense,] means a longer sentence for a
convicted drug dealer. It most certainly does. . . . Rather,the question concerns which sentencing statute governs the
precise length of the extra term of punishment," $ 924(c)(1)'s"blunt `mandatory minimum' " five-year sentence, or the

be more specific, as cogently explained on another day bytoday's opinion writer:

"The special `mandatory minimum' sentencing statutesays that anyone who `uses or carries' a gun `during and
in relation to any . . . drug trafficking crime' must re-ceive a mandatory five-year prison term added on to his
drug crime sentence. 18 U. S. C. $ 924(c). At the sametime, the Sentencing Guidelines, promulgated under the
authority of a different statute, 28 U. S. C. $ 994, providefor a two-level (i. e., a 30% to 40%) sentence enhancement where a `firearm . . . was possessed' by a drugoffender, U. S. S. G. $ 2D1.1(b)(1), unless the possession
clearly was not `connected with the [drug] offense.' "
McFadden, 13 F. 3d, at 467 (Breyer, C. J., dissenting).

In Muscarello's case, for example, the underlying drugcrimes involved the distribution of 3.6 kilograms of marijuana, and therefore carried a base offense level of 12. SeeUnited States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual

$ 2D1.1(a)(3) (Nov. 1995). After adjusting for Muscarello's
acceptance of responsibility, see id., $ 3E1.1(a), his final offense level was 10, placing him in the 6-to-12 month sentenc-ing range. See

id., ch. 5, pt. A. The two-level enhancement
for possessing a firearm, id., $ 2D1.1(b)(1), would have in-creased his final offense level to 12 (a sentencing range of 10

to 16 months). In other words, the less rigid (tailored to"the seriousness of the drug crime,"

McFadden, 13 F. 3d,
at 466) Guidelines regime would have added four months toMuscarello's prison time, in contrast to the five-year minimum addition the Court's reading of $ 924(c)(1) mandates.1

1 The Sentencing Guidelines carry out "a major congressional effort to
create a fairly sophisticated . . . system that distinguishes among different
kinds of criminal behavior and punishes accordingly." United States v.
McFadden, 13 F. 3d, at 467-468 (Breyer, C. J., dissenting). A "mandatory

3 Many newspapers, the New York Times among them, have published

stories using "transport," rather than "carry," to describe gun placements
resembling petitioners'. See, e. g., Atlanta Constitution, Feb. 27, 1998,

weapons to be carried into restaurants or transported anywhere in
cars."); Chicago Tribune, June 12, 1997, sports section, p. 13 ("Disabled

ries" means embedded in $ 924(c)(1). On definitions, "carry"in legal formulations could mean, inter alia, transport, possess, have in stock, prolong (carry over), be infectious, orwear or bear on one's person.

5 At issue here is not "carries"

at large but "carries a firearm." The Court's computersearch of newspapers is revealing in this light. Carrying

guns in a car showed up as the meaning "perhaps more than
one-third" of the time. Ante, at 129. One is left to wonderwhat meaning showed up some two-thirds of the time.

Surely a most familiar meaning is, as the Constitution's Sec-ond Amendment ("keep and

bear Arms") (emphasis added)
and Black's Law Dictionary, at 214, indicate: "wear, bear, orcarry . . . upon the person or in the clothing or in a pocket,

for the purpose . . . of being armed and ready for offensive
or defensive action in a case of conflict with another person."On lessons from literature, a scan of Bartlett's and other

quotation collections shows how highly selective the Court'schoices are. See

ante, at 129. If "[t]he greatest of writers"
have used "carry" to mean convey or transport in a vehicle,so have they used the hydra-headed word to mean,

516 U. S. 137, 145 (1995), contains 32 discrete definitions of "carry," including "[t]o make good or valid," "to bear the aspect of," and even "[t]o bear

These and the Court's lexicological sources demonstrate viv-idly that "carry" is a word commonly used to convey various
messages. Such references, given their variety, are not reli-able indicators of what Congress meant, in $ 924(c)(1), by
"carries a firearm." C

Noting the paradoxical statement, " `I use a gun to protectmy house, but I've never had to

use it,' " the Court in Bailey,516 U. S., at 143, emphasized the importance of context--

the statutory context. Just as "uses" was read to mean notsimply "possession," but "active employment," so "carries,"
correspondingly, is properly read to signal the most danger6 Popular films and television productions provide corroborative illustrations. In "The Magnificent Seven," for example, O'Reilly (played by
Charles Bronson) says: "You think I am brave because I carry a gun; well,
your fathers are much braver because they carry responsibility, for you,
your brothers, your sisters, and your mothers." See http://us.imdb.com/
M/search_quotes?for=carry. And in the television series "M*A*S*H,"
Hawkeye Pierce (played by Alan Alda) presciently proclaims: "I will not
carry a gun. . . . I'll carry your books, I'll carry a torch, I'll carry a tune,
I'll carry on, carry over, carry forward, Cary Grant, cash and carry, carry
me back to Old Virginia, I'll even `hari-kari' if you show me how, but
I will not carry a gun!" See http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/8915/

ous cases--the gun at hand, ready for use as a weapon.7 Itis reasonable to comprehend Congress as having provided

mandatory minimums for the most life-jeopardizing gun-connection cases (guns in or at the defendant's hand when
committing an offense), leaving other, less imminently
threatening, situations for the more flexible Guidelines re-gime.

8 As the Ninth Circuit suggested, it is not apparent

why possession of a gun in a drug dealer's moving vehiclewould be thought more dangerous than gun possession on

premises where drugs are sold: "A drug dealer who packsheat is more likely to hurt someone or provoke someone else
to violence. A gun in a bag under a tarp in a truck bed [orin a bedroom closet] poses substantially less risk."

United
States v. Foster, 133 F. 3d 704, 707 (1998) (en banc).9For indicators from Congress itself, it is appropriate to

consider word usage in other provisions of Title 18's chapteron "Firearms." See

Bailey, 516 U. S., at 143, 146 (interpreting $ 924(c)(1) in light of 18 U. S. C. $$ 922(g), 922( j), 922(k),
922(o)(1), 924(d)(1), 930(a), 930(b)). The Court, however,

7 In my view, the Government would carry its burden by proving a firearm was kept so close to the person as to approximate placement in a
pocket or holster, e. g., guns carried at one's side in a briefcase or handbag,
or strapped to the saddle of a horse. See ante, at 130.

8 The Court reports that the Courts of Appeals "have unanimously concluded that `carry' is not limited to the carrying of weapons directly on the
person." Ante, at 131. In Bailey, however, the Government's argument
based on a similar observation did not carry the day. See Brief for United
States in Bailey v. United States, O. T. 1995, Nos. 94-7448 and 94-7492,
p. 16, n. 4. No Court of Appeals had previously adopted an "active employment" construction of "uses . . . a firearm" in $ 924(c)(1), yet this Court
did exactly that. See 516 U. S., at 144.

9 The "Firearms" statutes indicate that Congress, unlike the Court, ante,

at 132-133, recognizes that a gun in the hand is indeed more dangerous
than a gun in the trunk. See, e. g., 18 U. S. C. $ 926A (permitting the
transportation of firearms in a vehicle, but only if "neither the firearm
nor any ammunition being transported is readily accessible or is directly
accessible from the passenger compartment of such transporting vehicle");
see infra, at 146-147.

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
does not derive from the statutory complex at issue its thesisthat " `[c]arry' implies personal agency and some degree of

possession, whereas `transport' does not have such a limitedconnotation and, in addition, implies the movement of goods
in bulk over great distances." Ante, at 134. Looking to
provisions Congress enacted, one finds that the Legislaturedid not acknowledge or routinely adhere to the distinction

the Court advances today; instead, Congress sometimes em-ployed "transports" when, according to the Court, "carries"
was the right word to use.Section 925(a)(2)(B), for example, provides that no criminal
sanction shall attend "the transportation of [a] firearm orammunition carried out to enable a person, who lawfully received such firearm or ammunition from the Secretary of the
Army, to engage in military training or in competitions."The full text of $ 926A, rather than the truncated version the

Court presents, see ibid., is also telling:

"Notwithstanding any other provision of any law or
any rule or regulation of a State or any political subdivi-sion thereof, any person who is not otherwise prohibited

by this chapter from transporting, shipping, or receivinga firearm shall be entitled to transport a firearm for any
lawful purpose from any place where he may lawfullypossess and carry such firearm to any other place where
he may lawfully possess and carry such firearm if, dur-ing such transportation the firearm is unloaded, and neither the firearm nor any ammunition being transported
is readily accessible or is directly accessible from thepassenger compartment of such transporting vehicle:

Provided, That in the case of a vehicle without a compartment separate from the driver's compartment the
firearm or ammunition shall be contained in a locked
container other than the glove compartment or console."

In describing when and how a person may travel in a vehicle that contains his firearm without violating the law,

Ginsburg, J., dissenting

$$ 925(a)(2)(B) and 926A use "transport," not "carry," to
"impl[y] personal agency and some degree of possession."
Ibid.10

Reading "carries" in $ 924(c)(1) to mean "on or about [one's]
person" is fully compatible with these and other "Firearms"
statutes.11 For example, under $ 925(a)(2)(B), one could
carry his gun to a car, transport it to the shooting competition, and use it to shoot targets. Under the conditions of

$ 926A, one could transport her gun in a car, but under no
circumstances could the gun be readily accessible while she
travels in the car. "[C]ourts normally try to read language
in different, but related, statutes, so as best to reconcile

10 The Court asserts that " `transport' is a broader category that includes
`carry' but also encompasses other activity." Ante, at 135. "Carry," however, is not merely a subset of "transport." A person seated at a desk
with a gun in hand or pocket is carrying the gun, but is not transporting
it. Yes, the words "carry" and "transport" often can be employed interchangeably, as can the words "carry" and "use." But in Bailey, this Court
settled on constructions that gave "carry" and "use" independent meanings. See 516 U. S., at 145-146. Without doubt, Congress is alert to the
discrete meanings of "transport" and "carry" in the context of vehicles,
as the Legislature's placement of each word in $ 926A illustrates. The
narrower reading of "carry" preserves discrete meanings for the two
words, while in the context of vehicles the Court's interpretation of
"carry" is altogether synonymous with "transport." Tellingly, when referring to firearms traveling in vehicles, the "Firearms" statutes routinely
use a form of "transport"; they never use a form of "carry."

11 See infra, at 149, nn. 13, 14. The Government points to numerous

federal statutes that authorize law enforcement officers to "carry firearms" and notes that, in those authorizing provisions, "carry" of course
means "both on the person and in a vehicle." Brief for United States
31-32, and n. 18. Quite right. But as viewers of "Sesame Street" will
quickly recognize, "one of these things [a statute authorizing conduct] is
not like the other [a statute criminalizing conduct]." The authorizing
statutes in question are properly accorded a construction compatible with
the clear purpose of the legislation to aid federal law enforcers in the
performance of their official duties. It is fundamental, however, that a
penal statute is not to be construed generously in the Government's favor.
See, e. g., United States v. Bass, 404 U. S. 336, 348 (1971).

those statutes, in light of their purposes and of commonsense." McFadden, 13 F. 3d, at 467 (Breyer, C. J., dissenting). So reading the "Firearms" statutes, I would not ex-tend the word "carries" in $ 924(c)(1) to mean transports out
of hand's reach in a vehicle.12

II
Section 924(c)(1), as the foregoing discussion details, is notdecisively clear one way or another. The sharp division in

the Court on the proper reading of the measure confirms,"[a]t the very least, . . . that the issue is subject to some
doubt. Under these circumstances, we adhere to the famil-iar rule that, `where there is ambiguity in a criminal statute,
doubts are resolved in favor of the defendant.' " AdamoWrecking Co. v. United States, 434 U. S. 275, 284-285 (1978)
(citation omitted); see United States v. Granderson, 511 U. S.39, 54 (1994) ("[W]here text, structure, and history fail to
establish that the Government's position is unambiguouslycorrect--we apply the rule of lenity and resolve the ambiguity in [the defendant's] favor."). "Carry" bears many mean12 The Court places undue reliance on Representative Poff's statement
that $ 924(c)(1) seeks " `to persuade the man who is tempted to commit a
Federal felony to leave his gun at home.' " Ante, at 132 (quoting 114
Cong. Rec. 22231 (1968)). As the Government argued in its brief to this
Court in Bailey:

"In making that statement, Representative Poff was not referring to the
`carries' prong of the original Section 924(c). As originally enacted, the
`carries' prong of the statute prohibited only the `unlawful' carrying of a
firearm while committing an offense. The statute would thus not have
applied to an individual who, for instance, had a permit for carrying a gun
and carried it with him when committing an offense, and it would have
had no force in `persuading' such an individual `to leave his gun at home.'
Instead, Representative Poff was referring to the `uses' prong of the original Section 924(c)." Brief for United States in Bailey v. United States,
O. T. 1995, Nos. 94-7448 and 94-7492, p. 28.

Representative Poff's next sentence confirms that he was speaking of
"uses," not "carries": "Any person should understand that if he uses his
gun and is caught and convicted, he is going to jail." 114 Cong. Rec., at
22231 (emphasis added).

ings, as the Court and the "Firearms" statutes demonstrate.13 The narrower "on or about [one's] person"
interpretation is hardly implausible nor at odds with an
accepted meaning of "carries a firearm."

Overlooking that there will be an enhanced sentence for
the gun-possessing drug dealer in any event, see supra, at
140-142, the Court asks rhetorically: "How persuasive is a
punishment that is without effect until a drug dealer who
has brought his gun to a sale (indeed has it available for
use) actually takes it from the trunk (or unlocks the glove
compartment) of his car?" Ante, at 133. Correspondingly,
the Court defines "carries a firearm" to cover "a person who
knowingly possesses and conveys firearms [anyplace] in a vehicle . . . which the person accompanies." Ante, at 126-127.
Congress, however, hardly lacks competence to select the
words "possesses" or "conveys" when that is what the Legislature means.14 Notably in view of the Legislature's capacity
to speak plainly, and of overriding concern, the Court's inquiry

13 Any doubt on that score is dispelled by examining the provisions
in the "Firearms" chapter, in addition to $ 924(c)(1), that include a form
of the word "carry": 18 U. S. C. $ 922(a)(5) ("carry out a bequest");

$$ 922(s)(6)(B)(ii), (iii) ("carry out this subsection"); $ 922(u) ("carry away
[a firearm]"); 18 U. S. C. $ 924(a)(6)(B)(ii) (1994 ed., Supp. II) ("carry or
otherwise possess or discharge or otherwise use [a] handgun"); 18 U. S. C.

$ 924(e)(2)(B) ("carrying of a firearm"); $ 925(a)(2) ("carried out to enable
a person"); $ 926(a) ("carry out the provisions of this chapter"); $ 926A
("lawfully possess and carry such firearm to any other place where he
may lawfully possess and carry such firearm"); $ 929(a)(1) ("uses or carries
a firearm and is in possession of armor piercing ammunition"); $ 930(d)(3)
("lawful carrying of firearms . . . in a Federal facility incident to hunting
or other lawful purposes") (emphasis added in all quotations).

14 See, e. g., 18 U. S. C. $ 924(a)(6)(B)(ii) (1994 ed., Supp. II) ("if the person

sold . . . a handgun . . . to a juvenile knowing . . . that the juvenile intended
to carry or otherwise possess . . . the handgun . . . in the commission of a
crime of violence"); 18 U. S. C. $ 926A ("may lawfully possess and carry
such firearm to any other place where he may lawfully possess and carry
such firearm"); $ 929(a)(1) ("uses or carries a firearm and is in possession

pays scant attention to a core reason for the rule of lenity:"[B]ecause of the seriousness of criminal penalties, and because criminal punishment usually represents the moral con-demnation of the community, legislatures and not courts
should define criminal activity. This policy embodies `theinstinctive distaste against men languishing in prison unless
the lawmaker has clearly said they should.' " United Statesv.

Bass, 404 U. S. 336, 348 (1971) (quoting H. Friendly, Mr.Justice Frankfurter and the Reading of Statutes, in Benchmarks 196, 209 (1967)).

* * *
The narrower "on or about [one's] person" construction of"carries a firearm" is consistent with the Court's construction of "uses" in Bailey to entail an immediacy element. Itrespects the Guidelines system by resisting overbroad readings of statutes that deviate from that system. See McFad-den, 13 F. 3d, at 468 (Breyer, C. J., dissenting). It fits plausibly with other provisions of the "Firearms" chapter, and itadheres to the principle that, given two readings of a penal
provision, both consistent with the statutory text, we do notchoose the harsher construction. The Court, in my view,
should leave it to Congress to speak " `in language that isclear and definite' " if the Legislature wishes to impose the
sterner penalty. Bass, 404 U. S., at 347 (quoting United
States v. Universal C. I. T. Credit Corp., 344 U. S. 218, 222(1952)). Accordingly, I would reverse the judgments of the

NEW MEXICO ex rel. ORTIZ v. REED
on petition for writ of certiorari to the supremecourt of new mexico

No. 97-1217. Decided June 8, 1998
After Ohio officials told respondent they planned to revoke his parole, he

fled to New Mexico. That State's Governor issued an extradition warrant, and respondent was arrested. A New Mexico trial court granted
him habeas relief on his claim that he was not a "fugitive" for extradition
purposes because he fled under duress, believing that Ohio authorities
intended to revoke his parole without due process and to cause him
physical harm if he were returned to prison. The State Supreme
Court affirmed.

Held: The Extradition Clause imposes a mandatory duty on the asylum

State, affording no discretion to its executive officers or courts. Once
a Governor has granted extradition, a court considering release on habeas can decide only whether (a) the documents on their face are in
order; (b) the petitioner has been charged with a crime in the demanding
State; (c) the petitioner is the person named in the extradition request;
and (d) the petitioner is a fugitive. Michigan v. Doran, 439 U. S. 282,
289. Claims relating to what actually happened in the demanding
State, the law of that State, and what may be expected to happen in
that State when the fugitive returns are issues to be decided by the
demanding State, not the asylum State. See Pacileo v. Walker, 449
U. S. 86, 88 (per curiam).

Certiorari granted; 124 N. M. 129, 947 P. 2d 86, reversed and remanded.

Per Curiam.
Respondent, sentenced to a term of 25 years upon convic-tion of armed robbery and theft of drugs, was paroled from

the Ohio correctional system in 1992. In the following yearOhio prison officials told respondent they planned to revoke
his parole status. Before the scheduled date of his meetingwith his parole officer, respondent fled from Ohio to New
Mexico.Ohio sought extradition and the Governor of New Mexico
issued a warrant directing the extradition of respondent.He was arrested in October 1994, and later that year sought

a writ of habeas corpus from the New Mexico State DistrictCourt. He claimed he was not a "fugitive" for purposes of

extradition because he fled under duress, believing that Ohioauthorities intended to revoke his parole without due process
and to cause him physical harm if he were returned to anOhio prison. In January 1995, the New Mexico trial court
ruled in favor of respondent and directed his release fromcustody. The State appealed this order, and in September
1997 the Supreme Court of New Mexico affirmed the grantof habeas corpus. 124 N. M. 129, 947 P. 2d 86 (1997). The
State has petitioned for certiorari from that decision.Article IV of the United States Constitution provides that:

"A person charged in any State with Treason, Felony, orother Crime, who shall flee from Justice, and be found
in another State, shall on Demand of the executive Au-thority of the State from which he fled, be delivered up,
to be removed to the State having Jurisdiction of theCrime." Art. IV, $ 2, cl. 2.

The Extradition Act, 18 U. S. C. $ 3182, provides the proce-dures by which this constitutional command is carried out.

In Michigan v. Doran, 439 U. S. 282 (1978), we said:

"Once the Governor has granted extradition, a courtconsidering release on habeas corpus can do no more

than decide (a) whether the extradition documents ontheir face are in order; (b) whether the petitioner has
been charged with a crime in the demanding state; (c)whether the petitioner is the person named in the request for extradition; and (d) whether the petitioner isa fugitive. These are historic facts readily verifiable."
Id., at 289.
The Supreme Court of New Mexico agreed that the firstthree requirements had been met, but decided that respondent was not a "fugitive" from justice; in the words of theSupreme Court of New Mexico, he was a "refugee from injustice." 124 N. M, at 146, 947 P. 2d, at 103. That court held

Per Curiam
that respondent fled Ohio because of fear that his parolewould be revoked without due process, and that he would be

thereafter returned to prison where he faced the threat ofbodily injury. This "duress" negated his status as a fugitive
under Article IV.These are serious charges, unrebutted by any evidence at
the hearing in the state trial court. It may be noted, how-ever, that the State of Ohio was not a party at that hearing,
and the State of New Mexico, which was defending the Gov-ernor's action, is at a considerable disadvantage in producing
testimony, even in affidavit form, of occurrences in the Stateof Ohio. Very likely Ohio was aware of our statement in
Sweeney v. Woodall, 344 U. S. 86, 89-90 (1952), that the"scheme of interstate rendition, as set forth in both the Constitution and the statutes which Congress has enacted to im-plement the Constitution, . . . do[es] not contemplate an appearance by [the demanding State] in respondent's asylumto defend against the claimed abuses of its prison system"
(footnotes omitted).We accept, of course, the determination of the Supreme
Court of New Mexico that respondent's testimony was credi-ble, but this is simply not the kind of issue that may be tried
in the asylum State. In case after case we have held thatclaims relating to what actually happened in the demanding
State, the law of the demanding State, and what may be ex-pected to happen in the demanding State when the fugitive
returns are issues that must be tried in the courts of thatState, and not in those of the asylum State. Drew v. Thaw,
235 U. S. 432 (1914); Sweeney v. Woodall, supra; Michigan v.Doran, supra; Pacileo v. Walker, 449 U. S. 86 (1980) (per
curiam). As we said in Pacileo:

"Once the Governor of California issued the warrant forarrest and rendition in response to the request of the

Governor of Arkansas, claims as to constitutional defectsin the Arkansas penal system should be heard in the
courts of Arkansas, not those of California. ` To allow

plenary review in the asylum state of issues that canbe fully litigated in the charging state would defeat

the plain purposes of the summary and mandatory pro-cedures authorized by Article IV, $ 2.' Michigan v.
Doran, supra, at 290." Id., at 88.
There are practical reasons as well as legal reasons whichsupport this result. In a brief filed by 40 States as

amicicuriae, we are advised that in 1997, for example, Ohio made

218 extradition requests from its sister States, and returned209 prisoners to other States. California in that same year
had a total of 685 demands and returns, New York 490, Texas700, and Pennsylvania 543.* The burden on a demanding
State of producing witnesses and records in the asylum Stateto counter allegations such as those of respondent's in this
case would be substantial, indeed.The Supreme Court of New Mexico also held that the New
Mexico Constitution's provision guaranteeing the right "ofseeking and obtaining safety" prevailed over the State's duty
under Article IV of the United States Constitution. But aslong ago as Kentucky v. Dennison, 24 How. 66 (1861), we
held that the duty imposed by the Extradition Clause on theasylum State was mandatory. In Puerto Rico v. Branstad,
483 U. S. 219, 227 (1987), we reaffirmed "the conclusion thatthe commands of the Extradition Clause are mandatory, and
afford no discretion to the executive officers or the courts ofthe asylum State." And in

California v. Superior Court ofCal., San Bernardino Cty., 482 U. S. 400, 405-406 (1987),

we said:

"The Federal Constitution places certain limits on thesovereign powers of the States, limits that are an essential part of the Framers' conception of national identityand Union. One such limit is found in Article IV, $ 2,
cl. 2, the Extradition Clause: [text of clause omitted].

"The obvious objective of the Extradition Clause isthat no State should become a safe haven for the fugitives from a sister State's criminal justice system."
As is apparent from the length of time this proceeding hastaken in the courts of New Mexico, it has been anything but

the "summary" proceeding contemplated by the decisionscited above. This is because the Supreme Court of New
Mexico went beyond the permissible inquiry in an extradi-tion case, and permitted the litigation of issues not open in
the asylum State. The State's petition for certiorari isgranted, the judgment of the New Mexico Supreme Court
is reversed, and the cause is remanded for proceedings notinconsistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

PHILLIPS et al. v. WASHINGTON LEGALFOUNDATION

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fifth circuit

No. 96-1578. Argued January 13, 1998--Decided June 15, 1998
Under Texas' Interest on Lawyers Trust Account (IOLTA) program, an

attorney who receives client funds must place them in a separate,
interest-bearing, federally authorized "NOW" account upon determining that the funds "could not reasonably be expected to earn interest
for the client or [that] the interest which might be earned . . . is not
likely to be sufficient to offset the cost of establishing and maintaining
the account, service charges, accounting costs and tax reporting costs
which would be incurred in attempting to obtain the interest." IOLTA
interest income is paid to the Texas Equal Access to Justice Foundation
(TEAJF), which finances legal services for low-income persons. The
Internal Revenue Service does not attribute such interest to the individual clients for federal income tax purposes if they have no control
over the decision whether to place the funds in the IOLTA account
and do not designate who will receive the interest. Respondents--a
public-interest organization having Texas members opposed to the
IOLTA program, a Texas attorney who regularly deposits client funds
in an IOLTA account, and a Texas businessman whose attorney retainer
has been so deposited--filed this suit against TEAJF and the other petitioners, alleging, inter alia, that the Texas IOLTA program violated
their rights under the Fifth Amendment, which provides that "private
property" shall not "be taken for public use, without just compensation."
The District Court granted petitioners summary judgment, reasoning
that respondents had no property interest in the IOLTA interest proceeds. The Fifth Circuit reversed, concluding that such interest belongs to the owner of the principal.

Held:

1. Interest earned on client funds held in IOLTA accounts is the "private property" of the client for Takings Clause purposes. The existence of a property interest is determined by reference to existing rules
or understandings stemming from an independent source such as state
law. Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, 408 U. S. 564, 577.
All agree that under Texas law the principal held in IOLTA accounts is
the client's "private property." Moreover, the general rule that "interest follows principal" applies in Texas. See Webb's Fabulous Pharmacies, Inc. v. Beckwith, 449 U. S. 155, 162. Petitioners' contention that

Syllabus
Webb's does not control because examples such as income-only trusts
and marital community property rules demonstrate that Texas does not,
in fact, adhere to the general rule is rejected. These examples miss the
point of Webb's. Their exception by Texas from the "interest follows
principal" rule has a firm basis in traditional property law principles,
whereas petitioners point to no such principles allowing the owner of
funds temporarily deposited in an attorney trust account to be deprived
of the interest the funds generate. Petitioners' further contention that
"interest follows principal" in Texas only if it is allowed by law does
not assist their cause. They do not argue that Texas law prohibits the
payment of interest on IOLTA funds, but, rather, that interest actually
"earned" by such funds is not the private property of the principal's
owner. Regardless of whether that owner has a constitutionally cognizable interest in the anticipated generation of interest by his funds,
any interest that does accrue attaches as a property right incident to
the ownership of the underlying principal. Petitioners' final argument
that the money transferred to the TEAJF is not "private property"
because IOLTA funds cannot reasonably be expected to generate interest income on their own is plainly incorrect under Texas' requirement that client funds be deposited in an IOLTA account "if the interest which might be earned" is insufficient to offset account costs and
service charges that would be incurred in obtaining it. It is not that
the funds to be placed in IOLTA accounts cannot generate interest, but
that they cannot generate net interest. This Court has indicated that
a physical item does not lack "property" status simply because it does
not have a positive economic or market value. See, e. g., Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U. S. 419, 435, 437, n. 15. While
IOLTA interest income may have no economically realizable value to
its owner, its possession, control, and disposition are nonetheless valuable rights. See Hodel v. Irving, 481 U. S. 704, 715. The United
States' argument that "private property" is not implicated here because
IOLTA interest income is "government-created value" is factually erroneous: The State does nothing to create value; the value is created by
respondents' funds. The Federal Government, through its banking and
taxation regulations, imposes costs on this value if private citizens attempt to exercise control over it. Waiver of these costs if the property
is remitted to the State hardly constitutes "government-created value."
In any event, this Court rejected a similar argument in Webb's, supra,
at 162. Pp. 163-171.

2. This Court leaves for consideration on remand the question
whether IOLTA funds have been "taken" by the State, as well as the
amount of "just compensation," if any, due respondents. P. 172.

94 F. 3d 996, affirmed.

(IOLTA) program. Under these programs, certain clientfunds held by an attorney in connection with his practice

of law are deposited in bank accounts. The interest incomegenerated by the funds is paid to foundations that finance
legal services for low-income individuals. The question pre-sented by this case is whether interest earned on client funds
held in IOLTA accounts is "private property" of either theclient or the attorney for purposes of the Takings Clause of
the Fifth Amendment. We hold that it is the property ofthe client.

I
In the course of their legal practice, attorneys are fre-quently required to hold client funds for various lengths of

time. Before 1980, an attorney generally held such fundsin noninterest-bearing, federally insured checking accounts
in which all client trust funds of an individual attorneywere pooled. These accounts provided administrative convenience and ready access to funds. They were nonin-terest bearing because federal law prohibited federally
insured banks and savings and loans from paying intereston checking accounts. See 12 U. S. C. $$ 371a, 1464(b)(1)(B),
1828(g). When a lawyer held a large sum in trust for hisclient, such funds were generally placed in an interestbearing savings account because the interest generated

outweighed the inconvenience caused by the lack of check-writing capabilities.

In 1980, Congress authorized the creation of NegotiableOrder of Withdrawal (NOW) accounts, which for the first
time permitted federally insured banks to pay interest ondemand deposits. $ 303, 94 Stat. 146, as amended, 12 U. S. C.

$ 1832. NOW accounts are permitted only for deposits that"consist solely of funds in which the entire beneficial interest is held by one or more individuals or by an organizationwhich is operated primarily for religious, philanthropic, charitable, educational, political, or other similar purposes andwhich is not operated for profit." $ 1832(a)(2). For-profit
corporations and partnerships are thus prohibited from earn-ing interest on demand deposits. See ibid. However, interpreting $ 1832(a), the Federal Reserve Board has con-cluded that corporate funds may be held in NOW accounts
if the funds are held in trust pursuant to a program underwhich charitable organizations have "the exclusive right
to the interest." Letter from Federal Reserve Board Gen-eral Counsel Michael Bradfield to Donald Middlebrooks (Oct.

Beginning with Florida in 1981, a number of States movedquickly to capitalize on this change in the banking regulations by establishing IOLTA programs. Texas followed suitin 1984. Its Supreme Court issued an order, now codified as
Article XI of the State Bar Rules, providing that an attorneywho receives client funds that are "nominal in amount or are
reasonably anticipated to be held for a short period of time"must place such funds in a separate, interest-bearing NOW
account (an IOLTA account). Tex. State Bar Rule, Art. XI,

of $ 1832(a). See Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense
Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 844 (1984).

Opinion of the Court

$ 5(A); Rules 4, 7 of the Texas Rules Governing the Opera-tion of the Texas Equal Access to Justice Program. Client

funds are considered "nominal in amount" or "held for ashort period of time" if the attorney holding the funds determines that

"such funds, considered without regard to funds of other
clients which may be held by the attorney, law firm orprofessional corporation, could not reasonably be expected to earn interest for the client or if the interestwhich might be earned on such funds is not likely to be
sufficient to offset the cost of establishing and maintaining the account, service charges, accounting costs andtax reporting costs which would be incurred in attempting to obtain the interest on such funds for the client."Texas IOLTA Rule 6.

Interest earned by the funds deposited in an IOLTA ac-count is to be paid to the Texas Equal Access to Justice Foundation (TEAJF), a nonprofit corporation established by theSupreme Court of Texas. Tex. State Bar Rule, Art. XI,

$$ 3, 4; Texas IOLTA Rule 9(a). TEAJF distributes thefunds to nonprofit organizations that "have as a primary purpose the delivery of legal services to low income persons."Texas IOLTA Rule 10. The Internal Revenue Service does
not attribute the interest generated by an IOLTA account to
the individual clients for federal income tax purposes so longas the client has no control over the decision whether to place

the funds in the IOLTA account and does not designate whowill receive the interest generated by the account. See Rev.
Rul. 81-209, 1981-2 Cum. Bull. 16; Rev. Rul. 87-2, 1987-1

Texas who maintains an IOLTA account into which heregularly deposits client funds. Id., at 82. Summers is a

Texas citizen and businessman whose work requires himto make regular use of the services of an attorney. In January 1994, Summers learned that a retainer he had depos-ited with his attorney was being held in an IOLTA account.
Id., at 85. In February 1994, respondents filed this suitagainst petitioners--TEAJF, W. Frank Newton, in his official capacity as chairman of TEAJF, and the nine Justicesof the Supreme Court of Texas. Respondents alleged,

interalia, that the Texas IOLTA program violated their rights

under the Fifth Amendment, by taking their property with-out just compensation.

The District Court granted summary judgment to peti-tioners, reasoning that respondents had no property interest in the interest proceeds generated by the funds held inIOLTA accounts.

Washington Legal Foundation v. TexasEqual Access to Justice Foundation, 873 F. Supp. 1 (WD

Tex. 1995). The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit re-versed, concluding that "any interest that accrues belongs
to the owner of the principal." Washington Legal Foundation v. Texas Equal Access to Justice Foundation, 94 F.3d 996, 1004 (1996). Because of a split over whether the

interest income generated by funds held in IOLTA ac-counts is private property for purposes of the Fifth Amendment's Takings Clause,3 we granted certiorari. 521 U. S.1117 (1997).

Opinion of the Court
v. Chicago, 166 U. S. 226, 239 (1897), provides that "privateproperty" shall not "be taken for public use, without just

compensation." Because the Constitution protects ratherthan creates property interests, the existence of a property
interest is determined by reference to "existing rules or un-derstandings that stem from an independent source such as
state law." Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, 408U. S. 564, 577 (1972).

All agree that under Texas law the principal held inIOLTA trust accounts is the "private property" of the client.
Texas IOLTA Rule 4 (discussing circumstances under which"client funds" must be deposited in an IOLTA account);
Texas Bar Rule 1.14(a) (lawyers "shall hold funds . . . be-longing in whole or in part to clients . . . separate from the
lawyer's own property"); see also Brief for United Statesas Amicus Curiae 10 ("There can be no doubt that the client funds underlying the IOLTA program are the propertyof respondents"). When deposited in an IOLTA account,
these funds remain in the control of a private attorney andare freely available to the client upon demand. As to the
principal, then, the IOLTA rules at most "regulate the useof [the] property."

Yee v. Escondido, 503 U. S. 519, 522(1992). Respondents do not contend that the State's regulation of the manner in which attorneys hold and manageclient funds amounts to a taking of private property. The
question in this case is whether the interest on an IOLTAaccount is "private property" of the client for whom the principal is being held.4

4 We granted certiorari in this case to answer the question whether
"interest earned on client trust funds held by lawyers in IOLTA accounts
[is] a property interest of the client or lawyer, cognizable under the . . .
Fifth Amendmen[t] to the U. S. Constitution . . . ." Pet. for Cert. i. Justice Souter contends that we should vacate the judgment of the Court
of Appeals because it was improper for that court to have answered this
question apart from the takings and just compensation questions. Petitioners, however, did not argue in their petition for certiorari that it was
error for the Fifth Circuit to address the property question alone. Because, under this Court's Rule 14(1)(a), our practice is to consider "[o]nly

Opinion of the Court
The rule that "interest follows principal" has been estab-lished under English common law since at least the mid1700's. Beckford v. Tobin, 1 Ves. Sen. 308, 310, 27 Eng. Rep.1049, 1051 (Ch. 1749) ("[I]nterest shall follow the principal,
as the shadow the body"). Not surprisingly, this rule hasbecome firmly embedded in the common law of the various
States.5 The Court of Appeals in this case, two of the three
the questions set forth in the petition, or fairly included therein," it would
be improper for us sua sponte to raise and address the question answered
by Justice Souter.

rule, citing Sellers v. Harris County, 483 S. W. 2d 242, 243
(Tex. 1972) ("The interest earned by deposit of money owned
by the parties to the lawsuit is an increment that accrues to
that money and to its owners"). Indeed, in Webb's Fabulous
Pharmacies, Inc. v. Beckwith, 449 U. S. 155, 162 (1980), we
cited the Sellers opinion as demonstrative of the general rule
that "any interest . . . follows the principal."

In Webb's, we addressed a Florida statute providing that
interest accruing on an interpleader fund deposited in the
registry of the court " `shall be deemed income of the office
of the clerk of the circuit court.' " Id., at 156, n. 1 (quoting
Fla. Stat. $ 28.33 (1977)) (emphasis deleted). The appellant
in that case filed an interpleader action in Florida state court
and tendered the sum at issue, nearly $2 million, into court.
In addition to deducting $9,228.74 from the interpleader fund
as a fee "for services rendered," the clerk of court also retained the more than $100,000 in interest income generated

Opinion of the Court
by the deposited funds. We held that the statute authoriz-ing the clerk to confiscate the earned interest violated the

Takings Clause. As we explained, "a State, by ipse dixit,may not transform private property into public property
without compensation" simply by legislatively abrogating
the traditional rule that "earnings of a fund are incidents ofownership of the fund itself and are property just as the fund

itself is property." 449 U. S., at 164. In other words, atleast as to confiscatory regulations (as opposed to those regulating the use of property), a State may not sidestep the Tak-ings Clause by disavowing traditional property interests
long recognized under state law. See id., at 163-164; see
also Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 505 U. S.
1003, 1029 (1992).

Petitioners nevertheless contend that Webb's does not control because Texas does not, in fact, adhere to the "interest
follows principal" rule, "at least if elevated to the level of
an absolute legal rule." Brief for Petitioners 22. They
point to several examples, such as income-only trusts and
marital community property rules, where under Texas law
interest does not follow principal. According to petitioners,
the IOLTA program is simply another exception to the
general rule.

We find these examples insufficient to dispel the presumption of deference given the views of a federal court as
to the law of a State within its jurisdiction. Bernhardt v.
Polygraphic Co. of America, 350 U. S. 198, 204 (1956). Petitioners' examples miss the point of our decision in Webb's.
Texas' exception of income-only trusts and certain marital
property from the general rule that "interest follows principal" has a firm basis in traditional property law principles.
Permitting the owner of a sum of money to distribute to a
designated beneficiary the interest income generated by his
principal is entirely consistent with the fundamental maxim
of property law that the owner of a property interest may
dispose of all or part of that interest as he sees fit. United

States v. General Motors Corp., 323 U. S. 373, 377-378 (1945)
(property "denote[s] the group of rights inhering in the citizen's relation to the physical thing, as the right to . . . dispose
of it"). Similarly, the Texas rules governing the distribution
of marital assets have a historical pedigree tracing back to
the marital property laws adopted by the Texas Congress
only four years after Texas became an independent republic.
W. McClanahan, Community Property Law in the United
States $ 3:23, pp. 123-124 (1982). But petitioners point to no
"background principles" of property law, Lucas, supra, at
1030, that would lead one to the conclusion that the owner of
a fund temporarily deposited in an attorney trust account
may be deprived of the interest the fund generates.

Petitioners further contend that "interest follows principal" is an incomplete explication of the Texas rule. Reply
Brief for Petitioners 11. Petitioners explain that interest
follows principal in Texas only if the interest is "allowed
by law or fixed by the parties." Cavnar v. Quality Control
Parking, Inc., 696 S. W. 2d 549, 552 (Tex. 1985). We fail
to see how this assists petitioners' cause. We agree that
the government has great latitude in regulating the circumstances under which interest may be earned. As we
explained in Andrus v. Allard, 444 U. S. 51, 66 (1979), "anticipated gains ha[ve] traditionally been viewed as less
compelling than other property-related interests." But
petitioners do not argue that the payment of interest on client funds deposited in an attorney trust account is not "allowed by law" in Texas. Rather, they argue that interest
actually "earned" by funds held in IOLTA accounts, Texas
IOLTA Rule 9, is not the private property of the owner of
the principal. However, regardless of whether the owner of
the principal has a constitutionally cognizable interest in the
anticipated generation of interest by his funds, any interest
that does accrue attaches as a property right incident to the
ownership of the underlying principal.

Opinion of the Court
Finally, petitioners argue that the interest income transferred to the TEAJF is not "private property" because the
client funds held in IOLTA accounts "cannot reasonably be
expected to generate interest income on their own." Brief
for Petitioners 18. As an initial matter, petitioners' assertion that client funds held in IOLTA accounts cannot be expected to generate interest income is plainly incorrect under
the express terms of the Texas IOLTA rules. Texas IOLTA
Rule 6 requires that client funds held by an attorney be deposited in an IOLTA account "if the interest which might be
earned" is insufficient to offset the "cost of establishing and
maintaining the account, service charges, accounting costs
and tax reporting costs which would be incurred in attempting to obtain the interest on such funds for the client." In
other words, it is not that the client funds to be placed in
IOLTA accounts cannot generate interest, but that they cannot generate net interest.

Whether client funds held in IOLTA accounts could generate net interest is a matter of some dispute. As written,
the Texas IOLTA program requires the calculation as to net
interest to be made "without regard to funds of other clients
which may be held by the attorney." Texas IOLTA Rule 6.
This provision would deny to an attorney the traditional
practice of pooling funds of several clients in one account, a
practice which might produce net interest when opening an
account for each client would not. But in the District Court,
petitioners agreed that this portion of the rule was not to
be enforced, and that an attorney could make the necessary
calculation on the basis of pooled accounts. Petitioners
made a similar concession during oral argument here. Tr. of
Oral Arg. 13-16. We accept this concession but find that it
does not avail petitioners.

We have never held that a physical item is not "property"
simply because it lacks a positive economic or market value.
For example, in Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV

524US1 Unit: $U81 [09-06-00 20:27:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN
170 PHILLIPS v. WASHINGTON LEGAL FOUNDATION

Opinion of the Court
Corp., 458 U. S. 419 (1982), we held that a property right
was taken even when infringement of that right arguably
increased the market value of the property at issue. Id.,
at 437, n. 15. Our conclusion in this regard was premised
on our longstanding recognition that property is more than
economic value, see id., at 435; it also consists of "the group
of rights which the so-called owner exercises in his dominion of the physical thing," such "as the right to possess, use
and dispose of it," General Motors, supra, at 380. While
the interest income at issue here may have no economically
realizable value to its owner, possession, control, and disposition are nonetheless valuable rights that inhere in the
property. See Hodel v. Irving, 481 U. S. 704, 715 (1987) (noting that "the right to pass on" property "is itself a valuable
right"). The government may not seize rents received by
the owner of a building simply because it can prove that the
costs incurred in collecting the rents exceed the amount
collected.

The United States, as amicus curiae, additionally argues
that "private property" is not implicated by the IOLTA program because the interest income generated by funds held in
IOLTA accounts is "government-created value." Brief for
United States as Amicus Curiae 20. We disagree. As an
initial matter, this argument is factually erroneous. The interest income transferred to the TEAJF is not the product
of increased efficiency, economies of scale, or pooling of funds
by the government. Indeed, as noted above, the State has
conceded at oral argument that if an attorney could in any
way (such as pooling of client funds) earn interest for a client,
he is ethically obligated to do so rather than place the funds
in an IOLTA account. Interest income is economically realizable by IOLTA primarily because: (1) the Federal Government imposes tax reporting costs only on those who attempt
to exercise control over the interest their funds generate, see
Rev. Rul. 81-209, 1981-2 Cum. Bull. 16; Rev. Rul. 87-2,

524US1 Unit: $U81 [09-06-00 20:27:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN

171Cite as: 524 U. S. 156 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
1987-1 Cum. Bull. 18; and (2) the Federal Government prohibits for-profit corporations from holding funds in NOW accounts if the interest is paid to the corporation, but permits
corporate funds to be held in NOW accounts if the interest
is paid to the TEAJF, see Federal Reserve's IOLTA Letter.
In other words, the State does nothing to create value; the
value is created by respondents' funds. The Federal Government, through the structuring of its banking and taxation
regulations, imposes costs on this value if private citizens
attempt to exercise control over it. Waiver of these costs
if the property is remitted to the State hardly constitutes
"government-created value."

In any event, we rejected a similar "government-created
value" argument in Webb's. There, the State of Florida
argued that since the clerk's authority to invest deposited
funds was a statutorily created right, any interest income
generated by the funds was not private property. 449 U. S.,
at 163. We rejected this argument, explaining that "the
State's having mandated the accrual of interest does not
mean the State or its designate is entitled to assume ownership of the interest." Id., at 162.

This would be a different case if the interest income generated by IOLTA accounts was transferred to the State as
payment "for services rendered" by the State. Id., at 157.
Our holding does not prohibit a State from imposing reasonable fees it incurs in generating and allocating interest income. See id., at 162; cf. United States v. Sperry Corp., 493
U. S. 52, 60 (1989) (upholding the imposition of a "reasonable
`user fee' " on those utilizing the Iran-United States Claims
Tribunal). But here the State does not, indeed cannot,
argue that its confiscation of respondents' interest income
amounts to a fee for services performed. Unlike in Webb's,
where the State safeguarded and invested the deposited
funds, funds held in IOLTA accounts are managed entirely
by banks and private attorneys.

In sum, we hold that the interest income generated byfunds held in IOLTA accounts is the "private property" of

the owner of the principal. We express no view as towhether these funds have been "taken" by the State; nor
do we express an opinion as to the amount of "just compen-sation," if any, due respondents. We leave these issues to
be addressed on remand. The judgment of the Court ofAppeals is

Affirmed.
Justice Souter, with whom Justice Stevens, Justice
Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer join, dissenting.

The Court holds that "interest income generated by fundsheld in IOLTA accounts is the `private property' of the

owner of the principal." Ante this page. I do not join intoday's ruling because the Court's limited enquiry has led
it to announce an essentially abstract proposition; even as-suming that the proposition correctly states the law, it may
ultimately turn out to have no significance in resolving thereal issue raised in this case, which is whether the Interest
on Lawyers Trust Account (IOLTA) scheme violates the Tak-ings Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Since the sounder
course would be to vacate the similarly limited judgment ofthe Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit and remand for
the broader enquiry outlined below, I respectfully dissent.The Court recognizes three distinct issues implicated by a
takings claim: whether the interest asserted by the plaintiffis property, whether the government has taken that property, and whether the plaintiff has been denied just compen-sation for the taking.

Ibid. The Court is careful to addressonly the first of these questions,

ibid., which is the only one
on which the Fifth Circuit ruled. See Washington Legal
Foundation v. Texas Equal Access to Justice Foundation,
94 F. 3d 996, 1004 (1996).

Souter, J., dissenting
The affirmative answer given by the Court and the Fifth
Circuit to the question whether IOLTA interest attributable
to a client's funds is the client's property states, in essence,
a proposition of state law, which is one source of property
interests entitled to federal constitutional protection, see
Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, 408 U. S. 564, 577
(1972), and Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 505
U. S. 1003, 1030 (1992). In this instance the relevant state
law is said to embrace the general principle that property in
interest income follows ownership of the principal on which
the interest is earned, ante, at 164-166, and n. 4, and the
Court treats any income generated by a client's funds like
income that the client could derive directly through a method
of money management or investment that costs more than it
produced, ante, at 169-171.

In addressing only the issue of the property interest, leaving the questions of taking and compensation for a later day
in the litigation of respondents' action, the Court and the
Court of Appeals have, however, postponed consideration of
the most salient fact relied upon by petitioners in contesting
respondents' Fifth Amendment claim: that the respondent
client would effectively be barred from receiving any net
interest on his funds subject to the state IOLTA rule by
the combination of an unchallenged federal banking statute
and regulation, 12 U. S. C. $ 1832(a); 12 CFR $ 204.130 (1997);
a separate, unchallenged Texas rule of attorney discipline,
Texas Bar Rules, Art. 10, $ 9, Rule 1.14(b); and unchallenged
Internal Revenue Service interpretations of the Tax Code,
Rev. Rul. 81-209, 1981-2 Cum. Bull. 16; Rev. Rul. 87-2,
1987-1 Cum. Bull. 18. The argument for the view contrary
to the one taken by the Court would emphasize that salient
fact right now. The view that the client has no cognizable
property right in the IOLTA interest is said to rest not only
on a different understanding of the scope of the general prin524US1 Unit: $U81 [09-06-00 20:27:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Souter, J., dissenting
ciple and its place in state law,1 but also upon the very regulatory framework that would prevent a client from obtaining any net interest on funds now subject to IOLTA, even
if IOLTA did not exist.2 It is not, of course, that the federal and state regulatory combination includes some rule
that is facially inconsistent with the general principle that
interest follows principal; the components of the regulatory
structure do not even directly address the question of who
owns interest. Indeed, the most obvious relevance of the
regulatory provisions and their effects is to the issues of
whether IOLTA results in a taking of the client's property
and whether any such taking requires compensation. And
yet by this route the regulatory structure becomes relevant
to the property issue as well, simply because the way we
may ultimately resolve the taking and compensation issues
bears on the way we ought to resolve the property issue.
If it should turn out that within the meaning of the Fifth
Amendment, the IOLTA scheme had not taken the property
recognized today, or if it should turn out that the "just compensation" for any taking was zero, then there would be no
practical consequence for purposes of the Fifth Amendment
in recognizing a client's property right in the interest in the
first place; any such recognition would be an inconsequential

1 The highest court of Texas has not understood the general principle
that a property right in interest always follows property in principle in a
way that supports respondents in this IOLTA challenge. See Sellers v.
Harris County, 483 S. W. 2d 242, 243 (Tex. 1972) (owner of principal is
entitled to interest, less administrative and accounting costs). Webb's
Fabulous Pharmacies, Inc. v. Beckwith, 449 U. S. 155 (1980), is not on
point precisely because it dealt with interest actually in the hands of the
fiduciary, net of any administrative expense.

2 These unchallenged state and federal rules clearly fall within the general category of relevant law defining property subject to constitutional
protection, see Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, 408 U. S. 564,
577 (1972) ("Property interests" are "created and their dimensions are
defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent
source such as state law").

abstraction. Cf. Hooker v. Burr, 194 U. S. 415, 419 (1904)
(If a contractual obligation is impaired, but the obligor is
"not injured to the extent of a penny thereby, his abstract
rights are unimportant"). The significance of the regulatory
structure, and the issues of taking and compensation, should
therefore be considered today.

Approaching the property issue in conjunction with the
two others would, in fact, be entirely faithful to the Fifth
Amendment, for as we have repeatedly said its Takings
Clause does nothing to bar the government from taking
property, but only from taking it without just compensation, see, e. g., First English Evangelical Lutheran Church
of Glendale v. County of Los Angeles, 482 U. S. 304, 315
(1987); Williamson County Regional Planning Comm'n v.
Hamilton Bank of Johnson City, 473 U. S. 172, 194 (1985).
It thus makes good sense to consider what is property only
in connection with what is a compensable taking, an approach to Fifth Amendment analysis that not only would
avoid spending time on what might turn out to be an entirely
theoretical matter, but would also reduce the risk of placing
such undue emphasis on the existence of a generalized property right as to distort the taking and compensation analyses
that necessarily follow before the Fifth Amendment's significance can be known.3

3 For example, with respect to the determination whether government
regulation "goes too far" in diminishing the value of a claimant's property,
we have repeatedly instructed that a "parcel of property could not first
be divided into what was taken and what was left for the purpose of
demonstrating the taking of the former to be complete and hence compensable." Concrete Pipe & Products of Cal., Inc. v. Construction Laborers
Pension Trust for Southern Cal., 508 U. S. 602, 644 (1993); see also Penn
Central Transp. Co. v. New York City, 438 U. S. 104, 130-131 (1978). With
its narrow focus on a party's right to any interest generated by its principal, the Court's opinion might be read (albeit erroneously, in my view) to
mean that the accrued interest is the only property right relevant to the
question whether IOLTA effects a taking.

176 PHILLIPS v. WASHINGTON LEGAL FOUNDATION

Souter, J., dissenting
That is not to say, of course, that we should resolve eitherthe taking or compensation issues here, for the Fifth Circuit

did not address them. Rather, we should determine herewhether either of the remaining issues might reasonably be
resolved against respondents; if so, we should not abstract
the property issue for resolution in their favor now, butshould return the case to the Court of Appeals to consider

all three issues before resolving the first. Suffice it to saythat both the taking and compensation questions are serious
ones for respondents.First, as to a taking, we start with

Penn Central Transp.
Co. v. New York City, 438 U. S. 104 (1978), and its guidance
about certain sorts of facts that are of particular importance
in what is supposed to be an "ad hoc, factual" enquiry, id.,
at 124, into whether the government has "go[ne] too far."
Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U. S. 393, 415 (1922).
Attention should be paid to the nature of the government's
action, its economic impact, and the degree of any interference with reasonable, investment-backed expectations.
Penn Central, supra, at 124. Here it is enough to note the
possible significance of the facts that there is no physical
occupation or seizure of tangible property, cf. Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U. S. 419, 426 (1982)
(noting that physical intrusion is "unusually serious" in the
takings context); that there is no apparent economic impact (since the client would have no net interest to go in his
pocket, IOLTA or no IOLTA); and that the facts present
neither anything resembling an investment nor (for the reason just given) any apparent basis for reasonably expecting
to obtain net interest. While a court would certainly consider any proposal that respondents might make for a departure from the Penn Central approach to vindicating the Fifth
Amendment in these circumstances, application of Penn Central would not bode well for claimants like respondents.

Second, as to the just compensation requirement, the
client's inability to earn net interest outside IOLTA, due to

524US1 Unit: $U81 [09-06-00 20:27:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN

177Cite as: 524 U. S. 156 (1998)
Souter, J., dissenting
the unchallenged federal and state regulations, raises seriousquestions about entitlement to any compensation (which, if

required, would convert any "taking" into a wash transac-tion from the client's standpoint). "Just compensation" generally means "the full monetary equivalent of the property
taken." United States v. Reynolds, 397 U. S. 14, 16 (1970).In determining the amount of just compensation for a taking, a court seeks to place a claimant " `in as good a positionpecuniarily as if his property had not been taken.' "

United
States v. 564.54 Acres of Monroe and Pike County Land,441 U. S. 506, 510 (1979) (quoting

Olson v. United States,
292 U. S. 246, 255 (1934)), calculating any loss objectively
and independently of the claimant's subjective valuation, see,
e. g., Kimball Laundry Co. v. United States, 338 U. S. 1, 5
(1949).

Thus, in deciding what award would be needed to place
the client respondent in as good a position as he would have
enjoyed without a taking, a court presumably would look to
the claimant's putative property interest as it was or would
have been enjoyed in the absence of IOLTA, cf. Boston
Chamber of Commerce v. Boston, 217 U. S. 189, 195 (1910),
and consequently would measure any required compensation
by the claimant's loss, not by the government's (or the public's) gain, ibid. This rule would not obviously produce
much benefit to respondents. While it has been suggested
in their favor that a cognizable taking may occur even when
value has been enhanced, on the supposed authority of Loretto, supra, at 437, n. 15, that case dealt only with physical
occupation, it rested on no finding that value had actually
been enhanced, and it held nothing about the legal consequences of an actual finding that enhancement had occurred.
The Court today makes a further suggestion of a way in
which respondents might deflect the objection that they have
lost nothing, when it observes that the notion of property is
not limited by the concept of value, ante, at 170. But the
Court makes the point by equating the government's seizure

Souter, J., dissenting
of funds from the pocket of a failing business owner withIOLTA's disposition of funds the client never had or could

have received. Neither the equation, nor its relevance tothe Fifth Amendment's guarantee of just compensation, is
immune to question.

But, however these issues of taking and compensationmay someday be adjudicated, two things are clear now: the

issues are serious and they might be resolved against re-spondents. If that should happen, today's holding would
stand as an abstract proposition without significance for theapplication of the Fifth Amendment.

If abstraction were guaranteed to be harmless, of course,
an abstract ruling now and again would not matter much,
beyond the time spent reaching it. But our law has been
wary of abstract legal propositions not only because the
common-law tradition is a practical one, but because abstractions pose their own peculiar risks. As The Chief Justice
noted in a different but related context, there is a danger in
"cutting loose the notion of `just compensation' from the
notion of `private property.' " Almota Farmers Elevator &
Warehouse Co. v. United States, 409 U. S. 470, 486 (1973)
(Rehnquist, J., dissenting); see also id., at 482-483 ("While
the inquiry as to what property interest is taken by the condemnor and the inquiry as to how that property interest
shall be valued are not identical ones, they cannot be divorced without seriously undermining a number of rules
dealing with the law of eminent domain").

One may wonder here not only whether the theoretical
property analysis may skew the resolution of the taking and
compensation issues that will follow, but also how far today's
holding may unsettle accepted governmental practice elsewhere. By recognizing an abstract property right to interest "actually `earned' " by a party's principal, ante, at 168,
does the Court not raise the possibility of takings challenges
whenever the government holds and makes use of the principal of private parties, as it frequently does? When, for

example, the National Government, or a State, has engagedin excessive tax withholding, it does not refund the interest earned between the time of withholding and the issu-ance of a refund. For any number of reasons unrelated to
the recognition or nonrecognition of a generalized property right in interest, but tied to the questions of takingsand compensation, it seems unlikely that such withholding

practices would violate the Fifth Amendment. Neverthe-less, the Court's abstract ruling may encourage claims of just
this sort.To avoid the dangers of abstraction, I would therefore
vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand forplenary Fifth Amendment consideration. If, however, the
property interest question is to be considered in the abstract,
I would recast it and answer it as Justice Breyer has done
in his own dissenting opinion, which I join.

Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Stevens, Justice Souter, and Justice Ginsburg join, dissenting.

The question presented is whether "interest earned on
client trust funds," which would "not earn interest" in the
absence of a special "IOLTA program," amounts to a "property interest of the client or lawyer" for purposes of the
Fifth Amendment's Takings Clause. Brief for Petitioners i;
Brief for Respondents i; see U. S. Const., Amdt. 5 ("nor
shall private property be taken for public use, without just
compensation").

The question presented is premised on four assumptions:
First, that lawyers sometimes hold small amounts of clients'
funds for short periods of time; second, that because of federal tax and banking rules and regulations, such funds normally could not earn interest during that time; third, that
state Interest on Lawyers Trust Account (IOLTA) rules require lawyers to place such funds in a special account where,
mixed with other funds, they will earn interest; and fourth,
that IOLTA rules require that interest earned on these funds

is distributed to groups that represent low-income individu-als rather than to the lawyers or their clients who own the

funds.Insofar as factual circumstances such as these raise a
Fifth Amendment question, I agree with Justice Souter
that the question is whether Texas, by requiring the plac-ing of the funds in special IOLTA accounts and depriving

the funds' owners of the subsequently earned interest hastemporarily "taken" what is undoubtedly "private property," namely, the client's funds, i. e., the principal, without"just compensation." To answer this (appropriately framed)
question, the parties and the lower courts would have to
consider whether the use of the principal in the fashion
dictated by the IOLTA rules amounts to a deprivation of a
property right, and, if so, whether the government's "taking" required compensating the owner of the funds, where
it did not deprive the funds' owners of interest they might
have otherwise received. But the Court of Appeals did not
address this latter question. See ante, at 179 (Souter, J.,
dissenting).

Although I believe it wrong to separate Takings Clause
analysis of the property rights at stake from analysis of
the alleged deprivation, I have considered the question presented on its own terms. And, on the majority's assumptions, I believe that its answer is not the right one.
The majority's answer rests upon the use of a legal truism,
namely, "interest follows principal," and its application of a

my view, neither truism nor case can answer the hypothetical
question the Court addresses.

The truism does not help because the question presented
assumes circumstances that differ dramatically from those in
which interest is ordinarily at issue. Ordinarily, principal is capable of generating interest for whoever holds it.
Here, by the very terms of the question, we must assume

that (because of pre-existing federal law) the client's princi-pal could not generate interest without IOLTA intervention.

That is to say, the client could not have had an expectationof receiving interest without that intervention. Nor can
one say that IOLTA rules excluded, or prevented, the client's use of his principal to generate interest that wouldotherwise be his. Under these circumstances, what is the

property right of the client that IOLTA could have "confis-cat[ed]"?

Ante, at 167.
The most that Texas law here could have taken from theclient is not a right to use his principal to create a benefit

(for he had no such right), but the client's right to keep the
client's principal sterile, a right to prevent the principal from
being put to productive use by others. Cf. National Bd. of
YMCA v. United States, 395 U. S. 85, 92-93 (1969) (noting
that government deprivation of property requiring compensation normally takes from an owner use that the owner
may otherwise make of the property). And whatever this
Court's cases may have said about the constitutional status
of such a right, they have not said that the Constitution
forces a State to confer, upon the owner of property that
cannot produce anything of value for him, ownership of the
fruits of that property should that property be rendered fertile through the government's lawful intervention. Cf., e. g.,
United States ex rel. TVA v. Powelson, 319 U. S. 266, 276
(1943) (no need to pay for value that the "power of eminent
domain" itself creates); City of New York v. Sage, 239 U. S.
57, 61 (1915) (city need not pay for value added by unifying
parcels where unification impracticable absent eminent domain); United States v. Twin City Power Co., 350 U. S. 222,
228 (1956) (to require payment for value created by government "would be to create private claims in the public domain"). Thus the question is whether "interest," earned
only as a result of IOLTA rules and earned upon otherwise
barren client principal, "follows principal." The slogan "interest follows principal" no more answers that question than

does King Diarmed's legendary slogan, "[T]o every cow hercalf." A. Birrell, Seven Lectures on The Law and History

of Copyright in Books 42 (1889) (internal quotation marksomitted). Cf.

Berkey v. Third Avenue Railway Co., 244
N. Y. 84, 94, 155 N. E. 58, 61 (1926) (Cardozo, J.) ("Metaphors
in law are to be narrowly watched, for starting as devices toliberate thought, they end often by enslaving it").

Nor can Webb's Fabulous Pharmacies answer the ques-tion presented. But for state intervention the principal in
that case could have, and would have, earned interest. See449 U. S., at 156-157, and nn. 1, 2 (state law required party
to deposit funds with court, authorized court to hold the
funds in an interest-bearing account, and allowed the court
to claim the interest as well as a fee). Here, federal law
ensured that, in the absence of IOLTA intervention, the client's principal would earn nothing. Webb's Fabulous Pharmacies holds that a state law which places that ordinary kind
of principal in an interest-bearing account (which interest
the State unjustifiably keeps) takes "private property . . . for
public use without just compensation." That holding says
little about this kind of principal, principal that otherwise is
barren. Nor do cases that find a private interest in property
with virtually no economic value tell us to whom the fruits
of that property belong when that property bears fruit
through the intervention of another. Ante, at 169-170 (citing Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., 458
U. S. 419 (1982); Hodel v. Irving, 481 U. S. 704, 715 (1987)).

If necessary, I should find an answer to the question presented in other analogies that this Court's precedents provide. Land valuation cases, for example, make clear that
the value of what is taken is bounded by that which is
"lost," not that which the "taker gained." Boston Chamber
of Commerce v. Boston, 217 U. S. 189, 195 (1910) (opinion
of Holmes, J.); see also United States v. Miller, 317 U. S.
369, 375 (1943) ("[S]pecial value to the condemnor . . . must
be excluded as an element of market value"); United States

Breyer, J., dissenting
v. Chandler-Dunbar Water Power Co., 229 U. S. 53, 75-76(1913). This principle suggests that the government must

pay the current value of condemned land, not the addedvalue that a highway it builds on the property itself creates.
It also suggests that condemnation of, say, riparian rightsin order to build a dam must be followed by compensation
for these rights, not for the value of the electricity that thedam would later produce. Cf.

id., at 76; Twin City PowerCo., supra, at 226-228; United States v. Appalachian Elec.

Power Co., 311 U. S. 377, 423-424, 427 (1940). Indeed, noone would say that such electricity was, for Takings Clause
purposes, the owner's "private property," where, as here, inthe absence of the lawful government "taking," there would
have been no such property.These legal analogies more directly address the key assumption raised by the question presented, namely, that "ab-sent the IOLTA program," no "interest" could have been
earned. I consequently believe that the interest earned is
not the client's "private property."I respectfully dissent.

Syllabus

BRYAN v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe second circuit

No. 96-8422. Argued March 31, 1998--Decided June 15, 1998
The Firearms Owners' Protection Act (FOPA) added 18 U. S. C. $ 924(a)

(1)(D) to the Criminal Code to prohibit anyone from "willfully" violating,
inter alia, $ 922(a)(1)(A), which forbids dealing in firearms without a
federal license. The evidence at petitioner's unlicensed dealing trial
was adequate to prove that he was dealing in firearms and that he knew
his conduct was unlawful, but there was no evidence that he was aware
of the federal licensing requirement. The trial judge refused to instruct the jury that he could be convicted only if he knew of the federal
licensing requirement, instructing, instead, that a person acts "willfully"
if he acts with the bad purpose to disobey or disregard the law, but that
he need not be aware of the specific law that his conduct may be violating. The jury found petitioner guilty. The Second Circuit affirmed,
concluding that the instructions were proper and that the Government
had elicited "ample proof" that petitioner had acted willfully.

Held: The term "willfully" in $ 924(a)(1)(D) requires proof only that the

defendant knew his conduct was unlawful, not that he also knew of the
federal licensing requirement. Pp. 191-200.

(a) When used in the criminal context, a "willful" act is generally one
undertaken with a "bad purpose." See, e. g., Heikkinen v. United
States, 355 U. S. 273, 279. In other words, to establish a "willful" violation of a statute, the Government must prove that the defendant
acted with knowledge that his conduct was unlawful. Ratzlaf v. United
States, 510 U. S. 135, 137. The Court rejects petitioner's argument
that, for two principal reasons, a more particularized showing is required here. His first contention--that the "knowingly" requirement
in $$ 924(a)(1)(A)-(C) for three categories of acts made unlawful by

$ 922 demonstrates that the Government must prove knowledge of
the law--is not persuasive because "knowingly" refers to knowledge
of the facts constituting the offense, as distinguished from knowledge
of the law, see, e. g., United States v. Bailey, 444 U. S. 394, 408. With
respect to the three $ 924 "knowingly" categories, the background presumption that every citizen knows the law makes it unnecessary to
adduce specific evidence to prove an evil-meaning mind. As regards
the "willfully" category here at issue, however, the jury must find that
the defendant acted with such a mind, i. e., with knowledge that his

185Cite as: 524 U. S. 184 (1998)
Syllabus
conduct was unlawful. Also rejected is petitioner's second argument:
that $ 924(a)(1)(D) must be read to require knowledge of the law in light
of this Court's adoption of a similar interpretation in cases concerned
with willful violations of the tax laws, see, e. g., Cheek v. United States,
498 U. S. 192, 201, and the willful structuring of cash transactions to
avoid a bank reporting requirement, see Ratzlaf, 510 U. S., at 138, 149.
Those cases are readily distinguishable because they involved highly
technical statutes that threatened to ensnare individuals engaged in
apparently innocent conduct. That danger is not present here because
the jury found that this petitioner knew that his conduct was unlawful.
Pp. 191-196.

(b) Petitioner's additional arguments based on his reading of congressional intent are rejected. FOPA's legislative history is too ambiguous to offer him much assistance, since his main support lies in statements made by opponents of the bill. See, e. g., Schwegmann Brothers
v. Calvert Distillers Corp., 341 U. S. 384, 394. His next argument--
that, at the time FOPA was passed, the "willfulness" requirements in

$$ 923(d)(1)(C)-(D) had uniformly been interpreted to require knowledge of the law--is inaccurate because a number of courts had reached
different conclusions. Moreover, the cases adopting petitioner's view
support the notion that disregard of a known legal obligation is sufficient to establish a willful violation, but in no way make it necessary.
Petitioner's final argument--that $ 922(b)(3), which is governed by

$ 924(a)(1)(D), indicates that Congress intended "willfully" to include
knowledge of the law--fails for a similar reason. Pp. 196-199.

(c) The trial court's misstatement of law in a jury instruction given
after the correct instructions were given--specifically, a sentence asserting that "the government [need not] prove that [petitioner] had
knowledge that he was breaking the law"--does not provide a basis
for reversal because (1) petitioner did not effectively object to that
sentence; (2) in the context of the entire instructions, it seems unlikely
that the jury was misled; (3) petitioner failed to raise this argument in
the Second Circuit; and (4) this Court's grant of certiorari was limited
to the narrow legal question hereinbefore decided. Pp. 199-200.

Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court.
Petitioner was convicted of "willfully" dealing in fire-arms without a federal license. The question presented is

whether the term "willfully" in 18 U. S. C. $ 924(a)(1)(D) re-quires proof that the defendant knew that his conduct was
unlawful, or whether it also requires proof that he knew ofthe federal licensing requirement.

I
In 1968 Congress enacted the Omnibus Crime Control andSafe Streets Act. 82 Stat. 197-239. In Title IV of that Act

Congress made findings concerning the impact of the trafficin firearms on the prevalence of lawlessness and violent
crime in the United States 1 and amended the Criminal Code

Foundation by James H. Jeffries III and James H. Wentzel; and for the
National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers by Barbara Bergman
and Stephen P. Halbrook.

1 "Sec. 901. (a) The Congress hereby finds and declares--

"(1) that there is a widespread traffic in firearms moving in or otherwise
affecting interstate or foreign commerce, and that the existing Federal
controls over such traffic do not adequately enable the States to control
this traffic within their own borders through the exercise of their police
power;

"(2) that the ease with which any person can acquire firearms other than
a rifle or shotgun (including criminals, juveniles without the knowledge
or consent of their parents or guardians, narcotics addicts, mental defectives, armed groups who would supplant the functions of duly constituted public authorities, and others whose possession of such weapons
is similarly contrary to the public interest) is a significant factor in the
prevalence of lawlessness and violent crime in the United States;

"(3) that only through adequate Federal control over interstate and foreign commerce in these weapons, and over all persons engaging in the
businesses of importing, manufacturing, or dealing in them, can this grave

Opinion of the Court
to include detailed provisions regulating the use and saleof firearms. As amended, 18 U. S. C. $ 922 defined a number of "unlawful acts"; subsection (a)(1) made it unlawful forany person except a licensed dealer to engage in the business
of dealing in firearms.2 Section 923 established the federallicensing program and repeated the prohibition against dealing in firearms without a license, and $ 924 specified the pen-alties for violating "any provision of this chapter." Read
literally, $ 924 authorized the imposition of a fine of up to$5,000 or a prison sentence of not more than five years, "or
both," on any person who dealt in firearms without a licenseeven if that person believed that he or she was acting lawfully.3 As enacted in 1968, $$ 922(a)(1) and 924 omitted anexpress scienter requirement and therefore arguably imposed strict criminal liability on every unlicensed dealer infirearms. The 1968 Act also omitted any definition of the
term "engaged in the business" even though that conductwas an element of the unlawful act prohibited by $ 922(a)(1).

In 1986 Congress enacted the Firearms Owners' Protec-tion Act (FOPA), in part, to cure these omissions. The findings in that statute explained that additional legislation wasnecessary to protect law-abiding citizens with respect to the
acquisition, possession, or use of firearms for lawful purproblem be properly dealt with, and effective State and local regulation
of this traffic be made possible . . . ." 82 Stat. 225.

2 82 Stat. 228. The current version of this provision, which is substantially the same as the 1968 version, is codified at 18 U. S. C. $ 922(a)(1)(A).
It states:

"(a) It shall be unlawful--
"(1) for any person--
"(A) except a licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, or licensed
dealer, to engage in the business of importing, manufacturing, or dealing
in firearms, or in the course of such business to ship, transport, or receive
any firearm in interstate or foreign commerce."

not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both."

$ 924 to add a scienter requirement as a condition to the imposition of penalties for most of the unlawful acts defined in

$ 922. For three categories of offenses the intent required
is that the defendant acted "knowingly"; for the fourth category, which includes "any other provision of this chapter,"
the required intent is that the defendant acted "willfully." 6

4 "The Congress finds that--

. . . . .
"(b)(2) additional legislation is required to reaffirm the intent of the
Congress, as expressed in section 101 of the Gun Control Act of 1968, that

acquisition, possession, or use of firearms appropriate to the purpose of
hunting, trapshooting, target shooting, personal protection, or any other
lawful activity, and that this title is not intended to discourage or eliminate
the private ownership or use of firearms by law-abiding citizens for lawful
purposes.' " 100 Stat. 449.

"(21) The term `engaged in the business' means--. . . . .

"(C) as applied to a dealer in firearms, as defined in section 921
(a)(11)(A), a person who devotes time, attention, and labor to dealing in
firearms as a regular course of trade or business with the principal objective of livelihood and profit through the repetitive purchase and resale of
firearms, but such term shall not include a person who makes occasional
sales, exchanges, or purchases of firearms for the enhancement of a personal collection or for a hobby, or who sells all or part of his personal
collection of firearms . . . ." 100 Stat. 449-450.

Opinion of the Court
The $ 922(a)(1)(A) 7 offense at issue in this case is an "otherprovision" in the "willfully" category.

II
The jury having found petitioner guilty, we accept theGovernment's version of the evidence. That evidence

proved that petitioner did not have a federal license to dealin firearms; that he used so-called "straw purchasers" in Ohio
to acquire pistols that he could not have purchased himself;that the straw purchasers made false statements when purchasing the guns; that petitioner assured the straw purchas-ers that he would file the serial numbers off the guns; and
that he resold the guns on Brooklyn street corners known fordrug dealing. The evidence was unquestionably adequate to
prove that petitioner was dealing in firearms, and that heknew that his conduct was unlawful.

8 There was, however,

no evidence that he was aware of the federal law that pro-hibits dealing in firearms without a federal license.

Petitioner was charged with a conspiracy to violate 18U. S. C. $ 922(a)(1)(A), by willfully engaging in the business of dealing in firearms, and with a substantive viola-tion of that provision.

9 After the close of evidence, petitioner requested that the trial judge instruct the jury thatpetitioner could be convicted only if he knew of the federal

"(C) knowingly imports or brings into the United States or any possession thereof any firearm or ammunition in violation of section 922(l); or

"(D) willfully violates any other provision of this chapter,
"shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than five years,
or both."

7 See n. 2, supra.

8 Why else would he make use of straw purchasers and assure them that

he would shave the serial numbers off the guns? Moreover, the street
corner sales are not consistent with a good-faith belief in the legality of
the enterprise.

9 Although the prohibition against unlicensed dealing in firearms is

set forth in $ 922, see n. 2, supra, the criminal sanction is set forth in

$ 924(a)(1), see n. 6, supra.

licensing requirement,10 but the judge rejected this request.Instead, the trial judge gave this explanation of the term

"willfully":

"A person acts willfully if he acts intentionally and pur-posely and with the intent to do something the law forbids, that is, with the bad purpose to disobey or to disre-gard the law. Now, the person need not be aware of the
specific law or rule that his conduct may be violating.But he must act with the intent to do something that
the law forbids." 11
Petitioner was found guilty on both counts. On appealhe argued that the evidence was insufficient because there

was no proof that he had knowledge of the federal licensingrequirement, and that the trial judge had erred by failing

to instruct the jury that such knowledge was an essentialelement of the offense. The Court of Appeals affirmed.
122 F. 3d 90 (CA2 1997). It concluded that the instructionswere proper and that the Government had elicited "ample
proof " that petitioner had acted willfully. App. 22.Because the Eleventh Circuit has held that it is necessary
for the Government to prove that the defendant acted withknowledge of the licensing requirement, United States v.

10 "KNOWLEDGE OF THE LAW
"The Federal Firearms Statute which the Defendant is charged with,
conspiracy to violate and with allegedly violated [sic], is a specific intent
statute. You must accordingly find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Defendant at all relevant times charged, acted with the knowledge that it
was unlawful to engage in the business of firearms distribution lawfully
purchased by a legally permissible transferee or gun purchaser.. . . . .

firearms licensing laws Defendant acted in knowing and intentional violation of them." App. 17 (citing Ratzlaf v. United States, 510 U. S. 135

III
The word "willfully" is sometimes said to be "a word ofmany meanings" whose construction is often dependent on

the context in which it appears. See, e. g., Spies v. United
States, 317 U. S. 492, 497 (1943). Most obviously it differ-entiates between deliberate and unwitting conduct, but in

the criminal law it also typically refers to a culpable stateof mind. As we explained in United States v. Murdock, 290
U. S. 389 (1933), a variety of phrases have been used to de-scribe that concept.

12 As a general matter, when used in

the criminal context, a "willful" act is one undertaken witha "bad purpose."

13 In other words, in order to establish a

12 "The word often denotes an act which is intentional, or knowing, or
voluntary, as distinguished from accidental. But when used in a criminal statute it generally means an act done with a bad purpose (Felton v.
United States, 96 U. S. 699; Potter v. United States, 155 U. S. 438; Spurr
v. United States, 174 U. S. 728); without justifiable excuse (Felton v.
United States, supra; Williams v. People, 26 Colo. 272; 57 Pac. 701; People

Batesville & W. Tel. Co., 80 Ark. 499; 97 S. W. 660; Clay v. State, 52 Tex. Cr.
555; 107 S. W. 1129); stubbornly, obstinately, perversely, Wales v. Miner, 89

v. Chicago Gt. W. Ry. Co., 136 Iowa 7; 111 N. W. 15; State v. Harwell, 129
N. C. 550; 40 S. E. 48. The word is also employed to characterize a thing
done without ground for believing it is lawful (Roby v. Newton, 121 Ga.
679; 49 S. E. 694), or conduct marked by careless disregard whether or not
one has the right so to act, United States v. Philadelphia & R. Ry. Co.,
223 Fed. 207, 210; State v. Savre, 129 Iowa 122; 105 N. W. 387; State v.
Morgan, 136 N. C. 628; 48 S. E. 670." 290 U. S., at 394-395.

13 See, e. g., Heikkinen v. United States, 355 U. S. 273, 279 (1958) ("There

can be no willful failure by a deportee, in the sense of $ 20(c), to apply

act done with a bad purpose"); Felton v. United States, 96 U. S. 699, 702

Opinion of the Court
"willful" violation of a statute, "the Government must prove
that the defendant acted with knowledge that his conduct
was unlawful." Ratzlaf v. United States, 510 U. S. 135, 137
(1994).

Petitioner argues that a more particularized showing is
required in this case for two principal reasons. First, he
argues that the fact that Congress used the adverb "knowingly" to authorize punishment of three categories of acts
made unlawful by $ 922 and the word "willfully" when it referred to unlicensed dealing in firearms demonstrates that
the Government must shoulder a special burden in cases like
this. This argument is not persuasive because the term
"knowingly" does not necessarily have any reference to a
culpable state of mind or to knowledge of the law. As Justice Jackson correctly observed, "the knowledge requisite
to knowing violation of a statute is factual knowledge as distinguished from knowledge of the law." 14 Thus, in United

intent to do it or to omit doing it. `The word "wilfully," ' says Chief Justice Shaw, `in the ordinary sense in which it is used in statutes, means not
merely "voluntarily," but with a bad purpose.' 20 Pick. (Mass.) 220. `It
is frequently understood,' says Bishop, `as signifying an evil intent without justifiable excuse.' Crim. Law, vol. i. sect. 428"); 1 L. Sand, J. Siffert,
W. Loughlin, & S. Reiss, Modern Federal Jury Instructions || 3A.01,
p. 3A-18 (1997) (" `Willfully' means to act with knowledge that one's conduct is unlawful and with the intent to do something the law forbids, that
is to say with the bad purpose to disobey or to disregard the law").

14 In his opinion dissenting from the Court's decision upholding the constitutionality of a statute authorizing punishment for the knowing violation of an Interstate Commerce regulation, Justice Jackson wrote:

"It is further suggested that a defendant is protected against indefiniteness because conviction is authorized only for knowing violations.
The argument seems to be that the jury can find that defendant knowingly
violated the regulation only if it finds that it knew the meaning of the
regulation he was accused of violating. With the exception of Screws v.

Opinion of the Court
States v. Bailey, 444 U. S. 394 (1980), we held that the prose-cution fulfills its burden of proving a knowing violation of

the escape statute "if it demonstrates that an escapee knewhis actions would result in his leaving physical confinement
without permission." Id., at 408. And in Staples v. United
States, 511 U. S. 600 (1994), we held that a charge that thedefendant's possession of an unregistered machinegun was

unlawful required proof "that he knew the weapon he pos-sessed had the characteristics that brought it within the statutory definition of a machinegun." Id., at 602. It was not,however, necessary to prove that the defendant knew that
his possession was unlawful. See Rogers v. United States,522 U. S. 252, 254-255 (1998) (plurality opinion). Thus, unless the text of the statute dictates a different result,15 theterm "knowingly" merely requires proof of knowledge of the
facts that constitute the offense.With respect to the three categories of conduct that are
made punishable by $ 924 if performed "knowingly," thebackground presumption that every citizen knows the law
makes it unnecessary to adduce specific evidence to provethat "an evil-meaning mind" directed the "evil-doing hand."

16

More is required, however, with respect to the conduct inthe fourth category that is only criminal when done "willfully." The jury must find that the defendant acted with anevil-meaning mind, that is to say, that he acted with knowledge that his conduct was unlawful.Petitioner next argues that we must read $ 924(a)(1)(D)

15 Liparota v. United States, 471 U. S. 419 (1985), was such a case. We

there concluded that both the term "knowing" in 7 U. S. C. $ 2024(c) and
the term "knowingly" in $ 2024(b)(1) literally referred to knowledge of the
law as well as knowledge of the relevant facts. See id., at 428-430.

Opinion of the Court
pretation of "willfully" in two other contexts. In certaincases involving willful violations of the tax laws, we have

concluded that the jury must find that the defendant wasaware of the specific provision of the tax code that he was
charged with violating. See, e. g., Cheek v. United States,
498 U. S. 192, 201 (1991).17 Similarly, in order to satisfy awillful violation in

Ratzlaf, we concluded that the jury had
to find that the defendant knew that his structuring of
cash transactions to avoid a reporting requirement was unlawful. See 510 U. S., at 138, 149. Those cases, however,
are readily distinguishable. Both the tax cases 18 and Ratzlaf 19 involved highly technical statutes that presented the

danger of ensnaring individuals engaged in apparently innocent conduct.20 As a result, we held that these statutes

17 Even in tax cases, we have not always required this heightened mens
rea. In United States v. Pomponio, 429 U. S. 10 (1976) (per curiam), for
example, the jury was instructed that a willful act is one done "with [the]
bad purpose either to disobey or to disregard the law." Id., at 11. We
approved of this instruction, concluding that "[t]he trial judge . . . adequately instructed the jury on willfulness." Id., at 13.

18 As we stated in Cheek v. United States, 498 U. S. 192, 199-200 (1991):

"The proliferation of statutes and regulations has sometimes made it
difficult for the average citizen to know and comprehend the extent of the
duties and obligations imposed by the tax laws. Congress has accordingly
softened the impact of the common-law presumption by making specific
intent to violate the law an element of certain federal criminal tax offenses. Thus, the Court almost 60 years ago interpreted the statutory
term `willfully' as used in the federal criminal tax statutes as carving out
an exception to the traditional rule [that every person is presumed to
know the law]. This special treatment of criminal tax offenses is largely
due to the complexity of the tax laws."

19 See Bates v. United States, 522 U. S. 23, 31, n. 6 (1997) (noting that

Ratzlaf's holding was based on the "particular statutory context of currency structuring"); Ratzlaf, 510 U. S., at 149 (Court's holding based on
"particular contex[t]" of currency structuring statute).

20 Id., at 144-145 ("[C]urrency structuring is not inevitably nefarious. . . .

Nor is a person who structures a currency transaction invariably motivated by a desire to keep the Government in the dark"; Government's
construction of the statute would criminalize apparently innocent activity); Cheek, 498 U. S., at 205 ("[I]n `our complex tax system, uncertainty

"carv[e] out an exception to the traditional rule" that ignorance of the law is no excuse 21 and require that the defendant
have knowledge of the law.22 The danger of convicting individuals engaged in apparently innocent activity that motivated our decisions in the tax cases and Ratzlaf is not present here because the jury found that this petitioner knew
that his conduct was unlawful.23

often arises even among taxpayers who earnestly wish to follow the law,'
and ` "[i]t is not the purpose of the law to penalize frank difference of
opinion or innocent errors made despite the exercise of reasonable care." '
United States v. Bishop, 412 U. S. 346, 360-361 (1973) (quoting Spies v.
United States, 317 U. S. 492, 496 (1943))"); Murdock, 290 U. S., at 396
("Congress did not intend that a person, by reason of a bona fide misunderstanding as to his liability for the tax, as to his duty to make a return, or
as to the adequacy of the records he maintained, should become a criminal
by his mere failure to measure up to the prescribed standard of conduct").

21 Cheek, 498 U. S., at 200; see also Ratzlaf, 510 U. S., at 149 (noting the

"venerable principle that ignorance of the law generally is no defense to a
criminal charge," but concluding that Congress intended otherwise in the
"particular contex[t]" of the currency structuring statute).

22 Even before Ratzlaf was decided, then-Chief Judge Breyer explained

why there was a need for specificity under those statutes that is inapplicable when there is no danger of conviction of a defendant with an innocent
state of mind. He wrote:

"I believe that criminal prosecutions for `currency law' violations, of the
sort at issue here, very much resemble criminal prosecutions for tax law
violations. Compare 26 U. S. C. $$ 6050I, 7203 with 31 U. S. C. $$ 5322,
5324. Both sets of laws are technical; and both sets of laws sometimes
criminalize conduct that would not strike an ordinary citizen as immoral
or likely unlawful. Thus, both sets of laws may lead to the unfair result
of criminally prosecuting individuals who subjectively and honestly believe they have not acted criminally. Cheek v. United States, 498 U. S.
192 . . . (1991), sets forth a legal standard that, by requiring proof that the
defendant was subjectively aware of the duty at issue, would avoid such
unfair results." United States v. Aversa, 984 F. 2d 493, 502 (CA1 1993)
(concurring opinion).

He therefore concluded that the "same standards should apply in both"
the tax cases and in cases such as Ratzlaf. 984 F. 2d, at 503.

23 Moreover, requiring only knowledge that the conduct is unlawful is

fully consistent with the purpose of FOPA, as FOPA was enacted to protect law-abiding citizens who might inadvertently violate the law. See

524us1$82I 02-22-99 22:42:40 PAGES OPINPGT
196 BRYAN v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
Thus, the willfulness requirement of $ 924(a)(1)(D) does not
carve out an exception to the traditional rule that ignorance
of the law is no excuse; knowledge that the conduct is unlawful is all that is required.

IV

Petitioner advances a number of additional arguments
based on his reading of congressional intent. Petitioner first
points to the legislative history of FOPA, but that history
is too ambiguous to offer petitioner much assistance. Petitioner's main support lies in statements made by opponents
of the bill.24 As we have stated, however, "[t]he fears and
doubts of the opposition are no authoritative guide to the
construction of legislation." Schwegmann Brothers v. Calvert Distillers Corp., 341 U. S. 384, 394 (1951). "In their
zeal to defeat a bill, they understandably tend to overstate
its reach." NLRB v. Fruit Packers, 377 U. S. 58, 66 (1964).25

Petitioner next argues that, at the time FOPA was passed,
the "willfulness" requirements in other subsections of

the statute--$$ 923(d)(1)(C)-(D)--had uniformly been interpreted by lower courts to require knowledge of the law; petitioner argues that Congress intended that "willfully" should
have the same meaning in $ 924(a)(1)(D). As an initial matter, the lower courts had come to no such agreement. While
some courts had stated that willfulness in $ 923(d)(1) is satisn. 4, supra; see also United States v. Andrade, 135 F. 3d 104, 108-109
(CA1 1998).

24 For example, Representative Hughes, a staunch opponent of the bill,

stated that the willfulness requirement would "make it next to impossible
to convict dealers, particularly those who engage in business without acquiring a license, because the prosecution would have to show that the
dealer was personally aware of every detail of the law, and that he made a
conscious decision to violate the law." 132 Cong. Rec. 6875 (1986). Even
petitioner's amicus acknowledges that this statement was "undoubtedly
an exaggeration." Brief for National Association of Criminal Defense
Lawyers as Amicus Curiae 14.

fied by a disregard of a known legal obligation,26 willful was
also interpreted variously to refer to "purposeful, intentional
conduct," 27 "indifferen[ce] to the requirements of the law," 28
or merely a "conscious, intentional, deliberate, voluntary decision." 29 Moreover, in each of the cases in which disregard
of a known legal obligation was held to be sufficient to establish willfulness, it was perfectly clear from the record that
the licensee had knowledge of the law; 30 thus, while these

Opinion of the Court
cases support the notion that disregard of a known legal obli-gation is sufficient to establish a willful violation, they in no

way stand for the proposition that it is required.31Finally, petitioner argues that $ 922(b)(3), which is governed by $ 924(a)(1)(D)'s willfulness standard, indicates thatCongress intended "willfully" to include knowledge of the
law. Section 922(b)(3) prohibits licensees from selling fire-arms to any person who the licensee knows or has reasonable
cause to believe does not reside in the licensee's State, exceptwhere,

inter alia, the transaction fully complies with thelaws of both the seller's and buyer's State. The subsection

further states that the licensee "shall be presumed, . . . inthe absence of evidence to the contrary, to have had actual
knowledge of the State laws and published ordinances ofboth States."

32 Although petitioner argues that the presumption in $ 922(b)(3) indicates that Congress intended will-fulness to require knowledge of the law for all offenses covered by $ 924(a)(1)(D), petitioner is mistaken. As notedabove, while disregard of a known legal obligation is certhe owner of the pawnshop, as well as his employees, had knowledge of
the law).

31 In Mayesh, for example, the court stated:

"The uncontroverted evidence shows clearly that plaintiff was aware of
the above holding period requirements. Mr. Mayesh had been previously
advised on the requirements under Illinois law, and he clearly acknowledged that he was aware of them. . . . Since the material facts are undisputed, as a matter of law the plaintiff clearly and knowingly violated the
Illinois holding provisions . . . , and hence, 18 U. S. C. $ 922(b)(2). This
court can only consider such action to have been `wilful' as a matter of
law. There is no basis for trial of any disputed facts in this connection.
This is sufficient to justify refusal of license renewal." 58 F. R. D., at 540.

See also, e. g., Perri, 637 F. 2d, at 1336 (stating that when a dealer understands the requirements of the law, but knowingly fails to follow them or
is indifferent to them, willfulness "is established," i. e., is satisfied); Stein's,
649 F. 2d, at 468 ("Evidence of repeated violations with knowledge of the
law's requirements has been held sufficient to establish willfulness" (emphasis added)); McLemore, 317 F. Supp., at 1078-1079.

tainly sufficient to establish a willful violation, it is not necessary--and nothing in $ 922(b)(3) contradicts this basic
distinction.33

V

One sentence in the trial court's instructions to the jury,
read by itself, contained a misstatement of the law. In a
portion of the instructions that were given after the correct
statement that we have already quoted, the judge stated:
"In this case, the government is not required to prove that
the defendant knew that a license was required, nor is the
government required to prove that he had knowledge that he
was breaking the law." App. 19 (emphasis added). If the
judge had added the words "that required a license," the
sentence would have been accurate, but as given it was not.

Nevertheless, that error does not provide a basis for reversal for four reasons. First, petitioner did not object to
that sentence, except insofar as he had argued that the
jury should have been instructed that the Government had
the burden of proving that he had knowledge of the federal
licensing requirement. Second, in the context of the entire
instructions, it seems unlikely that the jury was misled.
See, e. g., United States v. Park, 421 U. S. 658, 674-675 (1975).
Third, petitioner failed to raise this argument in the Court
of Appeals. Finally, our grant of certiorari was limited to

33 Petitioner also argues that the statutory language--"willfully violates
any other provision of this chapter"--indicates a congressional intent to
attach liability only when a defendant possesses specific knowledge of the
"provision[s] of [the] chapter." We rejected a similar argument in United
States v. International Minerals & Chemical Corp., 402 U. S. 558 (1971).
Although that case involved the word "knowingly" (in the phrase "knowingly violates any such regulation"), the response is the same:

"We . . . see no reason why the word `regulations' [or the phrase `any
other provision of this chapter'] should not be construed as a shorthand
designation for specific acts or omissions which violate the Act. The Act,
so viewed, does not signal an exception to the rule that ignorance of the
law is no excuse . . . ." Id., at 562.

It is so ordered.
Justice Souter, concurring.

I join in the Court's opinion with the caveat that if peti-tioner had raised and preserved a specific objection to the

erroneous statement in the jury instructions, see Part V, ante,at 199 and this page, I would vote to vacate the conviction.

Justice Scalia, with whom The Chief Justice and
Justice Ginsburg join, dissenting.

Petitioner Sillasse Bryan was convicted of "willfully" vio-lating the federal licensing requirement for firearms dealers.

The jury apparently found, and the evidence clearly shows,that Bryan was aware in a general way that some aspect of
his conduct was unlawful. See ante, at 189, and n. 8. Theissue is whether that general knowledge of illegality is
enough to sustain the conviction, or whether a "willful" viola-tion of the licensing provision requires proof that the defendant knew that his conduct was unlawful specifically becausehe lacked the necessary license. On that point the statute
is, in my view, genuinely ambiguous. Most of the Court'sopinion is devoted to confirming half of that ambiguity by
refuting Bryan's various arguments that the statute clearlyrequires specific knowledge of the licensing requirement.
Ante, at 192-199. The Court offers no real justification forits implicit conclusion that either (1) the statute unambiguously requires only general knowledge of illegality, or (2) ambiguously requiring only general knowledge is enough. In-stead, the Court curiously falls back on "the traditional rule

that ignorance of the law is no excuse" to conclude that "knowl-edge that the conduct is unlawful is all that is required."
Ante, at 196. In my view, this case calls for the applicationof a different canon--"the familiar rule that, `where there is

ambiguity in a criminal statute, doubts are resolved in favorof the defendant.' "

Adamo Wrecking Co. v. United States,
434 U. S. 275, 284-285 (1978), quoting United States v. Bass,404 U. S. 336, 348 (1971).

Title 18 U. S. C. $ 922(a)(1)(A) makes it unlawful for any
person to engage in the business of dealing in firearms with-out a federal license. That provision is enforced criminally

through $ 924(a)(1)(D), which imposes criminal penalties onwhoever "willfully violates any other provision of this chapter." The word "willfully" has a wide range of meanings,and " `its construction [is] often . . . influenced by its context.' " Ratzlaf v. United States, 510 U. S. 135, 141 (1994),
quoting Spies v. United States, 317 U. S. 492, 497 (1943). In
some contexts it connotes nothing more than "an act which

is intentional, or knowing, or voluntary, as distinguished
from accidental." United States v. Murdock, 290 U. S. 389,
394 (1933). In the present context, however, inasmuch
as the preceding three subparagraphs of $ 924 specify a
mens rea of "knowingly" for other firearms offenses, see

$$ 924(a)(1)(A)-(C), a "willful" violation under $ 924(a)(1)(D)
must require some mental state more culpable than mere
intent to perform the forbidden act. The United States concedes (and the Court apparently agrees) that the violation is
not "willful" unless the defendant knows in a general way
that his conduct is unlawful. Brief for United States 7-9;
ante, at 193 ("The jury must find that the defendant acted
with an evil-meaning mind, that is to say, that he acted with
knowledge that his conduct was unlawful").

That concession takes this case beyond any useful application of the maxim that ignorance of the law is no excuse.
Everyone agrees that $ 924(a)(1)(D) requires some knowledge
of the law; the only real question is which law? The Court's
answer is that knowledge of any law is enough--or, put another way, that the defendant must be ignorant of every law
violated by his course of conduct to be innocent of willfully
violating the licensing requirement. The Court points to no

524us1$82K 02-22-99 22:42:40 PAGES OPINPGT
202 BRYAN v. UNITED STATES

Scalia, J., dissenting
textual basis for that conclusion other than the notoriouslymalleable word "willfully" itself. Instead, it seems to fall

back on a presumption (apparently derived from the rulethat ignorance of the law is no excuse) that even where ignorance of the law is an excuse, that excuse should be construed as narrowly as the statutory language permits.I do not believe that the Court's approach makes sense

of the statute that Congress enacted. I have no quarrelwith the Court's assertion that "willfully" in $ 924(a)(1)(D)
requires only "general" knowledge of illegality--in the sensethat the defendant need not be able to recite chapter and
verse from Title 18 of the United States Code. It is enough,
in my view, if the defendant is generally aware that the
actus reus punished by the statute--dealing in firearms
without a license--is illegal. But the Court is willing to accept a mens rea so "general" that it is entirely divorced from
the actus reus this statute was enacted to punish. That approach turns $ 924(a)(1)(D) into a strange and unlikely creature. Bryan would be guilty of "willfully" dealing in firearms without a federal license even if, for example, he had
never heard of the licensing requirement but was aware that
he had violated the law by using straw purchasers or filing
the serial numbers off the pistols. Ante, at 189, n. 8. The
Court does not even limit (for there is no rational basis to
limit) the universe of relevant laws to federal firearms statutes. Bryan would also be "act[ing] with an evil-meaning
mind," and hence presumably be guilty of "willfully" dealing
in firearms without a license, if he knew that his streetcorner transactions violated New York City's business licensing or sales tax ordinances. (For that matter, it ought to
suffice if Bryan knew that the car out of which he sold the
guns was illegally double-parked, or if, in order to meet the
appointed time for the sale, he intentionally violated Pennsylvania's speed limit on the drive back from the gun purchase in Ohio.) Once we stop focusing on the conduct the
defendant is actually charged with (i. e., selling guns without

203Cite as: 524 U. S. 184 (1998)
Scalia, J., dissenting
a license), I see no principled way to determine what law thedefendant must be conscious of violating. See,

e. g., Lewis
v. United States, 523 U. S. 155, 174-175 (1998) (Scalia, J.,concurring in judgment) (pointing out a similar interpretive

problem potentially raised by the Assimilative Crimes Act).

Congress is free, of course, to make criminal liability underone statute turn on knowledge of another, to use its firearms

dealer statutes to encourage compliance with New YorkCity's tax collection efforts, and to put judges and juries
through the kind of mental gymnastics described above.But these are strange results, and I would not lightly assume
that Congress intended to make liability under a federal
criminal statute depend so heavily upon the vagaries of local
law--particularly local law dealing with completely unrelated subjects. If we must have a presumption in cases like
this one, I think it would be more reasonable to presume
that, when Congress makes ignorance of the law a defense
to a criminal prohibition, it ordinarily means ignorance of
the unlawfulness of the specific conduct punished by that
criminal prohibition.

That is the meaning we have given the word "willfully" in
other contexts where we have concluded it requires knowledge of the law. See, e. g., Ratzlaf, supra, at 149 ("To convict Ratzlaf of the crime with which he was charged, . . . the
jury had to find he knew the structuring in which he engaged
was unlawful"); Cheek v. United States, 498 U. S. 192, 201
(1991) ("[T]he standard for the statutory willfulness requirement is the `voluntary, intentional violation of a known legal
duty.' . . . [T]he issue is whether the defendant knew of the
duty purportedly imposed by the provision of the statute or
regulation he is accused of violating"). The Court explains
these cases on the ground that they involved "highly technical statutes that presented the danger of ensnaring individuals engaged in apparently innocent conduct." Ante, at 194.
That is no explanation at all. The complexity of the tax
and currency laws may explain why the Court interpreted

524us1$82K 02-22-99 22:42:40 PAGES OPINPGT
204 BRYAN v. UNITED STATES

Scalia, J., dissenting
"willful" to require some awareness of illegality, as opposedto merely "an act which is intentional, or knowing, or voluntary, as distinguished from accidental." Murdock, 290 U. S.,at 394. But it

in no way justifies the distinction the Court
seeks to draw today between knowledge of the law the defendant is actually charged with violating and knowledge of
any law the defendant could conceivably be charged with
violating. To protect the pure of heart, it is not necessaryto forgive someone whose surreptitious laundering of drug

money violates, unbeknownst to him, a technical currencystatute. There, as here, regardless of how "complex" the
violated statute may be, the defendant would have acted
"with an evil-meaning mind."

It seems to me likely that Congress had a presumption of
offense-specific knowledge of illegality in mind when it
enacted the provision here at issue. Another section of the
Firearms Owners' Protection Act, Pub. L. 99-308, 100 Stat.
449, prohibits licensed dealers from selling firearms to outof-state residents unless they fully comply with the laws
of both States. 18 U. S. C. $ 922(b)(3). The provision goes
on to state that all licensed dealers "shall be presumed, for

purposes of this subparagraph, in the absence of evidence to
the contrary, to have had actual knowledge of the State laws
and published ordinances of both States." Ibid. Like the
dealer-licensing provision at issue here, a violation of

$ 922(b)(3) is a criminal offense only if committed "willfully"
within the meaning of $ 924(a)(1)(D). The Court is quite correct that this provision does not establish beyond doubt that
"willfully" requires knowledge of the particular prohibitions
violated: the fact that knowledge (attributed knowledge) of
those prohibitions will be sufficient does not demonstrate
conclusively that knowledge of other prohibitions will not be
sufficient. Ante, at 198-199. But though it does not demonstrate, it certainly suggests. To say that only willful violation of a certain law is criminal, but that knowledge of the
existence of that law is presumed, fairly reflects, I think, a

presumption that willful violation requires knowledge of thelaw violated.

If one had to choose, therefore, I think a presumption ofstatutory intent that is the opposite of the one the Court
applies would be more reasonable. I would not, however,decide this case on the basis of any presumption at all. It
is common ground that the statutory context here requiressome awareness of the law for a $ 924(a)(1)(D) conviction, but
the statute is simply ambiguous, or silent, as to the precisecontours of that

mens rea requirement. In the face of thatambiguity, I would invoke the rule that " `ambiguity concerning the ambit of criminal statutes should be resolved in favorof lenity,' "

United States v. Bass, 404 U. S., at 347, quotingRewis v. United States, 401 U. S. 808, 812 (1971).

"The rule that penal laws are to be construed strictly,is, perhaps, not much less old than construction itself.
It is founded on the tenderness of the law for the rightsof individuals; and on the plain principle that the power
of punishment is vested in the legislative, not in thejudicial department." United States v. Wiltberger, 5
Wheat. 76, 95 (1820).
In our era of multiplying new federal crimes, there is morereason than ever to give this ancient canon of construction

consistent application: by fostering uniformity in the inter-pretation of criminal statutes, it will reduce the occasions
on which this Court will have to produce judicial havoc byresolving in defendants' favor a Circuit conflict regarding the
substantive elements of a federal crime, see, e. g., Bousley v.United States, 523 U. S. 614 (1998).

I respectfully dissent.

PENNSYLVANIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS

et al. v. YESKEY

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe third circuit

No. 97-634. Argued April 28, 1998--Decided June 15, 1998
Respondent Yeskey was sentenced to 18 to 36 months in a Pennsylvania

correctional facility, but was recommended for placement in a Motivational Boot Camp for first-time offenders, the successful completion of
which would have led to his parole in just six months. When he was
refused admission because of his medical history of hypertension, he
sued petitioners, Pennsylvania's Department of Corrections and several
officials, alleging that the exclusion violated the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), Title II of which prohibits a "public entity"
from discriminating against a "qualified individual with a disability" on
account of that disability, 42 U. S. C. $ 12132. The District Court dismissed for failure to state a claim, holding the ADA inapplicable to state
prison inmates, but the Third Circuit reversed.

Held: State prisons fall squarely within Title II's statutory definition of

"public entity," which includes "any . . . instrumentality of a State . . .
or local government." $ 12131(1)(B). Unlike the situation that obtained in Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452, there is no ambiguous
exception that renders the coverage uncertain. For that reason the
plain-statement requirement articulated in Gregory, if applicable to federal intrusion upon the administration of state prisons, has been met.
Petitioners' attempts to derive an intent not to cover prisons from the
statutory references to the "benefits" of programs and to "qualified individual" are rejected; some prison programs, such as this one, have benefits and are restricted to qualified inmates. The statute's lack of ambiguity also requires rejection of petitioners' appeal to the doctrine of
constitutional doubt. The Court does not address the issue whether
applying the ADA to state prisons is a constitutional exercise of Congress's power under either the Commerce Clause or the Fourteenth
Amendment because it was addressed by neither of the lower courts.
Pp. 208-213.

118 F. 3d 168, affirmed.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court.
The question before us is whether Title II of the Ameri-cans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), 104 Stat. 337, 42

U. S. C. $ 12131 et seq., which prohibits a "public entity" fromdiscriminating against a "qualified individual with a disability" on account of that individual's disability, see $ 12132, cov-ers inmates in state prisons. Respondent Ronald Yeskey
was such an inmate, sentenced in May 1994 to serve 18 to 36months in a Pennsylvania correctional facility. The sentencing court recommended that he be placed in Pennsylvania'sMotivational Boot Camp for first-time offenders, the successful completion of which would have led to his release onparole in just six months. See Pa. Stat. Ann., Tit. 61, $ 1121
et seq. (Purdon Supp. 1998). Because of his medical historyof hypertension, however, he was refused admission. He
filed this suit against petitioners, the Commonwealth ofPennsylvania's Department of Corrections and several department officials, alleging that his exclusion from the BootCamp violated the ADA. The District Court dismissed for
failure to state a claim, Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 12(b)(6), holdingthe ADA inapplicable to inmates in state prisons; the Third
Circuit reversed, 118 F. 3d 168 (1997); we granted certiorari,522 U. S. 1086 (1998).

Petitioners argue that state prisoners are not covered bythe ADA for the same reason we held in Gregory v. Ashcroft,
501 U. S. 452 (1991), that state judges were not covered bythe Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA),
29 U. S. C. $ 621 et seq. Gregory relied on the canon of con-struction that absent an "unmistakably clear" expression of

Opinion of the Court
States and the Federal Government," we will interpret astatute to preserve rather than destroy the States' "substantial sovereign powers." 501 U. S., at 460-461 (citations andinternal quotation marks omitted). It may well be that exercising ultimate control over the management of state pris-ons, like establishing the qualifications of state government
officials, is a traditional and essential state function subjectto the plain-statement rule of

Gregory. "One of the primaryfunctions of government," we have said, "is the preservation of societal order through enforcement of the criminallaw, and the maintenance of penal institutions is an essential
part of that task." Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U. S. 396, 412(1974), overruled on other grounds,

Thornburgh v. Abbott,490 U. S. 401, 414 (1989). "It is difficult to imagine an activity in which a State has a stronger interest," Preiser v. Rod-riguez, 411 U. S. 475, 491 (1973).

Assuming, without deciding, that the plain-statement ruledoes govern application of the ADA to the administration of
state prisons, we think the requirement of the rule is amplymet: the statute's language unmistakably includes State prisons and prisoners within its coverage. The situation hereis not comparable to that in

Gregory. There, althoughthe ADEA plainly covered state employees, it contained an

exception for " `appointee[s] on the policymaking level' "which made it impossible for us to "conclude that the statute
plainly cover[ed] appointed state judges." 501 U. S., at 467.
Here, the ADA plainly covers state institutions without anyexception that could cast the coverage of prisons into doubt.

Title II of the ADA provides:

"Subject to the provisions of this subchapter, no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of suchdisability, be excluded from participation in or be denied

the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of apublic entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any
such entity." 42 U. S. C. $ 12132.

210 PENNSYLVANIA DEPT. OF CORRECTIONS v. YESKEY

Opinion of the Court
State prisons fall squarely within the statutory definition of"public entity," which includes "any department, agency, special purpose district, or other instrumentality of a State orStates or local government." $ 12131(1)(B).

Petitioners contend that the phrase "benefits of the serv-ices, programs, or activities of a public entity," $ 12132, creates an ambiguity, because state prisons do not provide pris-oners with "benefits" of "programs, services, or activities" as
those terms are ordinarily understood. We disagree. Mod-ern prisons provide inmates with many recreational "activities," medical "services," and educational and vocational"programs," all of which at least theoretically "benefit" the
prisoners (and any of which disabled prisoners could be "ex-cluded from participation in"). See Block v. Rutherford, 468
U. S. 576, 580 (1984) (referring to "contact visitation pro-gram"); Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U. S. 517, 552 (1984) (discussing "rehabilitative programs and services"); Olim v. Waki-nekona, 461 U. S. 238, 246 (1983) (referring to "appropriate
correctional programs for all offenders"). Indeed, the stat-ute establishing the Motivational Boot Camp at issue in this
very case refers to it as a "program." Pa. Stat. Ann., Tit.61, $ 1123 (Purdon Supp. 1998). The text of the ADA provides no basis for distinguishing these programs, services,and activities from those provided by public entities that are
not prisons.We also disagree with petitioners' contention that the term
"qualified individual with a disability" is ambiguous insofaras concerns its application to state prisoners. The statute
defines the term to include anyone with a disability

"who, with or without reasonable modifications to rules,policies, or practices, the removal of architectural, communication, or transportation barriers, or the provisionof auxiliary aids and services, meets the essential eligibility requirements for the receipt of services or the par-ticipation in programs or activities provided by a public
entity." 42 U. S. C. $ 12131(2).

211Cite as: 524 U. S. 206 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
Petitioners argue that the words "eligibility" and "participa-tion" imply voluntariness on the part of an applicant who

seeks a benefit from the State, and thus do not connote pris-oners who are being held against their will. This is wrong
on two counts: First, because the words do not connote voluntariness. See, e. g., Webster's New International Diction-ary 831 (2d ed. 1949) ("eligible": "Fitted or qualified to be

chosen or elected; legally or morally suitable; as, an eligiblecandidate");

id., at 1782 ("participate": "To have a share in
common with others; to partake; share, as in a debate").While "eligible" individuals "participate" voluntarily in many

programs, services, and activities, there are others for which
they are "eligible" in which "participation" is mandatory. A
drug addict convicted of drug possession, for example, might,
as part of his sentence, be required to "participate" in a drug
treatment program for which only addicts are "eligible."
And secondly, even if the words did connote voluntariness, it
would still not be true that all prison "services," "programs,"
and "activities" are excluded from the ADA because participation in them is not voluntary. The prison law library, for
example, is a service (and the use of it an activity), which
prisoners are free to take or leave. Cf. Gabel v. Lynaugh,
835 F. 2d 124, 125, n. 1 (CA5 1988) (per curiam) ("pro se civil
rights litigation has become a recreational activity for state
prisoners"). In the very case at hand, the governing law
makes it clear that participation in the Boot Camp program
is voluntary. See Pa. Stat. Ann., Tit. 61, $ 1126(a) (Purdon
Supp. 1998) ("An eligible inmate may make an application to
the motivational boot camp selection committee for permission to participate in the motivational boot camp program");

$ 1126(c) ("[c]onditio[n]" of "participa[tion]" is that applicant
"agree to be bound by" certain "terms and conditions").

Finally, petitioners point out that the statute's statement
of findings and purpose, 42 U. S. C. $ 12101, does not mention
prisons and prisoners. That is perhaps questionable, since
the provision's reference to discrimination "in such critical

212 PENNSYLVANIA DEPT. OF CORRECTIONS v. YESKEY

Opinion of the Court
areas as . . . institutionalization," $ 12101(a)(3), can bethought to include penal institutions. But assuming it to be

true, and assuming further that it proves, as petitioners con-tend, that Congress did not "envisio[n] that the ADA would
be applied to state prisoners," Brief for Petitioners 13-14,
in the context of an unambiguous statutory text that is irrel-evant. As we have said before, the fact that a statute can

be " `applied in situations not expressly anticipated by Con-gress does not demonstrate ambiguity. It demonstrates
breadth.' " Sedima, S. P. R. L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U. S. 479,499 (1985) (citation omitted).

Our conclusion that the text of the ADA is not ambiguous
causes us also to reject petitioners' appeal to the doctrine of
constitutional doubt, which requires that we interpret statutes to avoid "grave and doubtful constitutional questions,"
United States ex rel. Attorney General v. Delaware & Hudson Co., 213 U. S. 366, 408 (1909). That doctrine enters in
only "where a statute is susceptible of two constructions,"
ibid. And for the same reason we disregard petitioners' invocation of the statute's title, "Public Services," 104 Stat.
337. "[T]he title of a statute . . . cannot limit the plain meaning of the text. For interpretive purposes, [it is] of use only
when [it] shed[s] light on some ambiguous word or phrase."
Trainmen v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 331 U. S. 519, 528-
529 (1947).

We do not address another issue presented by petitioners:
whether application of the ADA to state prisons is a constitutional exercise of Congress's power under either the Commerce Clause, compare Printz v. United States, 521 U. S. 898
(1997), with Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit
Authority, 469 U. S. 528 (1985), or $ 5 of the Fourteenth
Amendment, see City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U. S. 507
(1997). Petitioners raise this question in their brief, see
Brief for Petitioners 22-23, but it was addressed by neither
the District Court nor the Court of Appeals, where petitioners raised only the Gregory plain-statement issue. "Where

Opinion of the Court
issues are neither raised before nor considered by the Courtof Appeals, this Court will not ordinarily consider them."

Adickes v. S. H. Kress & Co., 398 U. S. 144, 147, n. 2 (1970)(citations omitted). See also Dothard v. Rawlinson, 433
U. S. 321, 323, n. 1 (1977); Duignan v. United States, 274 U. S.195, 200 (1927). We decline to do so here.

Because the plain text of Title II of the ADA unambigu-ously extends to state prison inmates, the judgment of the

AMERICAN TELEPHONE & TELEGRAPH CO. v.

CENTRAL OFFICE TELEPHONE, INC.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 97-679. Argued March 23, 1998--Decided June 15, 1998
Respondent purchases "bulk" communications services from long-distance

providers, such as petitioner AT&T, and resells them to its customers.
Petitioner, as a common carrier under the Communications Act of 1934,
must file with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) "tariffs"
containing all its "charges" for interstate services and all "classifications, practices, and regulations affecting such charges," 47 U. S. C.

$ 203(a). A carrier may not "extend to any person any privileges or
facilities in such communication, or employ or enforce any classifications,
regulations, or practices affecting such charges, except as specified
in such [tariff]." $ 203(c). The FCC requires carriers to sell longdistance services to resellers under the same rates, terms, and conditions as apply to other customers. In 1989, petitioner agreed to sell
respondent a long-distance service, which, under the parties' written
subscription agreements, would be governed by the rates, terms, and
conditions in the appropriate AT&T tariffs. Respondent soon experienced problems with the service it received, and withdrew from the
contract before the expiration date. Meanwhile, it had sued petitioner
in Federal District Court, asserting, inter alia, state-law claims for
breach of contract and for tortious interference with contractual relations (viz., respondent's contracts with its customers), the latter claim
derivative of the former. Respondent alleged that petitioner had promised and failed to deliver various service, provisioning, and billing options in addition to those set forth in the tariff, and that petitioner's
conduct was willful, so that consequential damages were available under
the tariff. The Magistrate Judge rejected petitioner's argument that
the claims were pre-empted by $ 203's filed-tariff requirements; he
declined, however, to instruct on punitive damages for the tortiousinterference claim. The jury found for respondent and awarded damages. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the judgment, but reversed the Magistrate Judge's failure to instruct on punitive damages and remanded for
a trial on that aspect of the case.

Held: The Communications Act's filed-tariff requirements pre-empt respondent's state-law claims. Pp. 221-228.

Syllabus
(a) Sections 203(a) and (c) are modeled after similar provisions of the
Interstate Commerce Act (ICA), and the "filed rate doctrine" associated
with the ICA tariff provisions applies to the Communications Act as
well. MCI Telecommunications Corp. v. American Telephone & Telegraph Co., 512 U. S. 218, 229-231. Under that doctrine, the rate a carrier duly files is the only lawful charge. Louisville & Nashville R. Co.
v. Maxwell, 237 U. S. 94, 97. Even if a carrier intentionally misrepresents its rate and a customer relies on the misrepresentation, the carrier
cannot be held to the promised rate if it conflicts with the published
tariff. Kansas City Southern R. Co. v. Carl, 227 U. S. 639, 653. That
this case involves services and billing rather than rates or ratesetting
does not make the filed rate doctrine inapplicable. Since rates have
meaning only when one knows the services to which they are attached,
any claim for excessive rates can be couched as a claim for inadequate
services and vice versa. The Communications Act recognizes this in
the $$ 203(a) and (c) requirements, and the cases decided under the ICA
make it clear that discriminatory privileges are not limited to discounted
rates, see, e. g., United States v. Wabash R. Co., 321 U. S. 403, 412-413.
Pp. 221-224.

(b) This Court's filed-rate cases involving special services claims cannot be distinguished on the ground that the services they involved
should have been included in the tariff. That is precisely the case here.
Even provisioning and billing are "covered" by the applicable tariff.
Nor does it make any difference that petitioner provided the same services, without charge, to other customers; that only tends to show that
petitioner acted unlawfully with regard to the other customers as well.
Pp. 224-226.

(c) The analysis used in evaluating respondent's contract claim applies
with equal force to its wholly derivative tortious-interference claim.
The Communications Act's saving clause does not dictate a different
result. It copies the ICA's saving clause, which has long been held to
preserve only those rights that are not inconsistent with the statutory
filed-rate requirements. Keogh v. Chicago & Northwestern R. Co., 260
U. S. 156, 163. Finally, respondent's argument that petitioner's willful
misconduct makes the relief awarded here consistent with the tariff is
rejected. Pp. 226-228.

respondent.*

Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court.
Respondent Central Office Telephone, Inc. (COT), a re-seller of long-distance communications services, sued petitioner AT&T, a provider of long-distance communicationsservices, under state law for breach of contract and tortious
interference with contract. Petitioner is regulated as acommon carrier under the Communications Act of 1934, 48
Stat. 1064, as amended, 47 U. S. C. $ 151 et seq. The issuebefore us is whether the federal filed-tariff requirements
of the Communications Act pre-empt respondent's state-lawclaims.

I
Respondent purchases "bulk" long-distance services--volume-discounted services designed for large customers--

from long-distance providers, and resells them to smallercustomers. Like many other resellers in the telecommunications industry, respondent does not own or operate facili-ties of its own; it is known as a "switchless reseller," which
is the industry nomenclature for arbitrageur. Of course re-spondent passes along only a portion of the bulk-purchase
discount to its aggregated customers, and retains the re-maining discount as profit.

Opinion of the Court
observe certain substantive requirements imposed by thatlaw. Section 203 of the Act requires that common carriers

file "schedules" (also known as "tariffs") containing all their"charges" for interstate services and all "classifications, practices, and regulations affecting such charges." $ 203(a).
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which isthe agency responsible for enforcing the Act, requires carriers to sell long-distance services to resellers such as respond-ent under the same rates, terms, and conditions as apply to
other customers.Prior to 1989, petitioner had developed a type of longdistance service known as Software Defined Network (SDN),
designed to meet the needs of large companies with offices
in multiple locations. SDN established a "virtual private
network" that allowed employees in different locations to
communicate easily. For example, an employee in Washington could call a co-worker in Denver simply by dialing a
four-digit extension. SDN customers, in exchange for a
commitment to purchase large volumes of long-distance communication time, received this service at a rate much below
what it would otherwise cost.

Several changes to SDN in 1989 made the service extremely attractive to resellers, such as respondent, who aggregate smaller customers. Petitioner developed the capability to allow customers to use ordinary ("switched access")
telephone lines to connect locations to their SDN networks.
Previously, locations had to be connected over special "dedicated access" lines, which are direct lines from a location's
telephone system to petitioner's long-distance network, bypassing the switches of the local exchange carrier. Dedicated access involves large fixed costs, so it is cost effective
only when a location originates a large volume of calls.
Switched access, in contrast, does not entail additional high
fixed costs, so it is better suited to small users and hence to
resellers. Petitioner also instituted two pricing promotions
for SDN in 1989: additional discounts from the basic SDN

Opinion of the Court

rates for customers making large usage and duration com-mitments, and waiver of installation charges for customers

making multiyear commitments (subject to penalties forearly termination). Petitioner also added a new billing option. In addition to network billing, whereby petitioner prepares a single bill that applies the tariffed rate to all usage atall locations, petitioner started to offer multilocation billing

(MLB), which allows the SDN volume discounts to be appor-tioned between an SDN customer and individual locations on
its network, with the proportion being chosen by the cus-tomer. Under this option, petitioner sends bills directly to
the customer's individual locations (which, in the case of resellers, means to the reseller's customers) but the customer
(or reseller) remains responsible for all payments. The tariff provides, however, that petitioner is not responsible for
the allocation of charges. See AT&T Tariff FCC No. 1,

$ 6.2.4 (1986), App. to Brief for Petitioner 24a.

Attracted by these changes, in October 1989, respondent
approached petitioner regarding its possible purchase of
SDN. LaDonna Kisor, a sales representative in petitioner's
Portland, Oregon, office, described the service and gave respondent literature on SDN. She predicted that petitioner
could establish an initial SDN network for respondent in four
to five months, and could thereafter add new locations within
30 days of receiving an order. Respondent subscribed to a
tariffed switched-access SDN plan under which the up-front
installation charges would be waived and respondent would
receive a 17% to 20% discount off basic SDN rates in exchange for a 4-year commitment to purchase two million minutes of service annually. Respondent also requested MLB.
Petitioner confirmed respondent's order, stating that respondent would obtain SDN " `pursuant to the rates, terms
and conditions in AT&T's [FCC Tariff No. 1],' " and that the
provisions of the tariff, " `including limitations on AT&T's
liabilities, shall govern your and AT&T's obligations and liabilities with respect to the service and options you have

Opinion of the Court
selected.' " Brief for Petitioner 14. Respondent acceptedthese terms in writing on October 30, 1989.

By February 1990, it had become apparent that the de-mand for SDN exceeded petitioner's expectations--largely
because of the switchless resellers attracted to the service.
Petitioner could not fill the volumes of switched-access or-ders as rapidly as dedicated access orders, or as quickly

as petitioner's personnel had predicted. Accordingly, Ms.Kisor notified respondent that it would take up to 90 days to
add new locations after the initial SDN was established.She suggested placing respondent's customers with another
AT&T service, the Multilocation Calling Plan (MLCP), until
they could be placed on SDN. Respondent agreed to this,
and ordered MLCP. Again, respondent signed a letter confirming that MLCP " `is provided under the terms and conditions stated in AT&T's Tariff F. C. C. Nos. 1 and 2.' " Brief
for Appellant in Nos. 94-36116, 94-36156 (CA9), p. 15.

Ms. Kisor informed respondent that its initial SDN network was functioning in April 1990. At that point, respondent elected to increase to a larger SDN volume commitment
in order to qualify for a larger discount. In placing this
order, respondent signed a form stating that the SDN service " `WILL BE GOVERNED BY THE RATES AND
TERMS AND CONDITIONS IN THE APPROPRIATE
AT&T TARIFFS.' " Brief for Petitioner 14-15. Respondent then began reselling SDN to its own customers and placing orders with petitioner that required petitioner to treat
respondent's customers as if they were new locations on a
corporate SDN.

Almost from the outset, respondent experienced problems
with the network, including delays in provisioning (the filling
of orders) and in billing. An additional billing problem was
especially damaging to respondent: respondent's customers
received bills reflecting 100% of the discount instead of the
50% respondent selected. These problems continued, and in
October 1990, they led respondent to switch to network bill524US1 Unit: $U84 [09-06-00 20:39:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court

ing. Although respondent continued to resell SDN, it was
ultimately unable to meet its usage commitment for the first
period in which it was applicable. In September 1992, respondent notified petitioner that it was terminating its SDN
service effective September 30, 1992, with 18 months remaining on its contract.

Meanwhile, on November 27, 1991, respondent had filed
suit against petitioner in the United States District Court
for the District of Oregon. The complaint contained a variety of claims, none of which arose under the Communications
Act, and ultimately two state-law claims went to trial: (1)
breach of contract (including breach of an implied covenant
of good faith and fair dealing); and (2) tortious interference
with contractual relations (viz., respondent's contracts with
its customers). Respondent's state-law claims rested on the
allegation that its contracts with petitioner were not limited
by petitioner's tariff but also included certain understandings respondent's president derived from reading petitioner's
brochures and talking with its representatives. According
to respondent, petitioner promised various service, provisioning, and billing options in addition to those set forth in
the tariff. Respondent also claimed that petitioner violated
its state-law implied duty of good faith and fair dealing by
taking actions that undermined the purpose of the contract
for respondent, which was to purchase SDN services for
resale at a profit. The tortious-interference claim was derivative of the contract claim. Respondent asserted that,
because respondent promised certain benefits of SDN to its
customers, and because petitioner provided competing services, any intentional violation of petitioner's contractual duties constituted tortious-interference with respondent's relationship with its customers. Respondent also asserted that,
since petitioner's conduct was willful, consequential damages
were available under the terms of the tariff. Petitioner filed
a counterclaim to recover $200,000 in unpaid tariffed charges

Opinion of the Court
from April to October 1990, and to obtain the terminationcharges that respondent did not pay in 1992.

Throughout the proceedings in District Court, petitionerargued that respondent's state-law contract and tort claims
were pre-empted by the filed-tariff requirements of $ 203 ofthe Act. The Magistrate Judge rejected this argument and
instructed the jury to consider not only the written subscrip-tion agreements, but also any statements made or documents
furnished before the parties signed the agreements " `if youfind that the parties intended that those statements or written materials form part of their agreements.' " Brief forPetitioner 18. The Magistrate Judge also instructed the
jury that it could not find for respondent on its contractclaims unless it found that petitioner engaged in willful misconduct. He declined to instruct on punitive damages forthe tortious-interference claim. The jury found for respondent on its state-law claims, rejected petitioner's counter-claim, and awarded respondent $13 million in lost profits.
The Magistrate Judge reduced the judgment to $1.154 mil-lion, which represented the lost profits respondent claimed
during the period before it canceled SDN on September 30,1992; he found that there was no competent evidence for lost
profits after that date. The Court of Appeals, over a dissentby Judge Brunetti, affirmed the judgment but reversed the
Magistrate Judge's failure to instruct on punitive damagesand remanded for a trial on that aspect of the case. 108
F. 3d 981 (CA9 1997). We granted certiorari to determinewhether the federal filed-rate requirements of $ 203 pre-empt
respondent's claims. 522 U. S. 1024 (1997).

Section 203(a) of the Communications Act requires everycommon carrier to file with the FCC "schedules,"

i. e., tariffs,"showing all charges" and "showing the classifications, practices, and regulations affecting such charges." 47 U. S. C.$ 203(a). Section 203(c) makes it unlawful for a carrier to

v. CENTRAL OFFICE TELEPHONE, INC.

Opinion of the Court

"extend to any person any privileges or facilities in suchcommunication, or employ or enforce any classifications, regulations, or practices affecting such charges, except as speci-fied in such schedule." These provisions are modeled after
similar provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act (ICA) and
share its goal of preventing unreasonable and discriminatorycharges.

MCI Telecommunications Corp. v. American
Telephone & Telegraph Co., 512 U. S. 218, 229-230 (1994).Accordingly, the century-old "filed rate doctrine" associated

with the ICA tariff provisions applies to the CommunicationsAct as well. See

id., at 229-231; Arkansas Louisiana Gas
Co. v. Hall, 453 U. S. 571, 577 (1981); cf. United States Nav.
Co. v. Cunard S. S. Co., 284 U. S. 474, 481 (1932). In Louisville & Nashville R. Co. v. Maxwell, 237 U. S. 94, 97 (1915),
we described the basic contours of the filed rate doctrineunder the ICA:

"Under the Interstate Commerce Act, the rate of the
carrier duly filed is the only lawful charge. Deviation
from it is not permitted upon any pretext. Shippers
and travelers are charged with notice of it, and they as
well as the carrier must abide by it, unless it is found
by the Commission to be unreasonable. Ignorance or
misquotation of rates is not an excuse for paying or
charging either less or more than the rate filed. This
rule is undeniably strict and it obviously may work
hardship in some cases, but it embodies the policy
which has been adopted by Congress in the regulation
of interstate commerce in order to prevent unjust
discrimination."

Thus, even if a carrier intentionally misrepresents its rate
and a customer relies on the misrepresentation, the carrier
cannot be held to the promised rate if it conflicts with the
published tariff. Kansas City Southern R. Co. v. Carl, 227
U. S. 639, 653 (1913).

Opinion of the Court
While the filed rate doctrine may seem harsh in some
circumstances, see, e. g., Maislin Industries, U. S., Inc. v.
Primary Steel, Inc., 497 U. S. 116, 130-131 (1990), its strict
application is necessary to "prevent carriers from intentionally `misquoting' rates to shippers as a means of offering them rebates or discounts," the very evil the filing requirement seeks to prevent. Id., at 127. Regardless of the
carrier's motive--whether it seeks to benefit or harm a particular customer--the policy of nondiscriminatory rates is violated when similarly situated customers pay different rates
for the same services. It is that antidiscriminatory policy
which lies at "the heart of the common-carrier section of the
Communications Act." MCI Telecommunications Corp. v.
American Telephone & Telegraph Co., supra, at 229.

The Ninth Circuit thought the filed rate doctrine inapplicable "[b]ecause this case does not involve rates or ratesetting, but rather involves the provisioning of services and
billing." 108 F. 3d, at 990. Rates, however, do not exist
in isolation. They have meaning only when one knows the
services to which they are attached. Any claim for excessive rates can be couched as a claim for inadequate services
and vice versa. "If `discrimination in charges' does not include non-price features, then the carrier could defeat the
broad purpose of the statute by the simple expedient of providing an additional benefit at no additional charge. . . . An
unreasonable `discrimination in charges,' that is, can come in
the form of a lower price for an equivalent service or in the
form of an enhanced service for an equivalent price." Competitive Telecommunications Assn. v. FCC, 998 F. 2d 1058,
1062 (CADC 1993). The Communications Act recognizes
this when it requires the filed tariff to show not only
"charges," but also "the classifications, practices, and regulations affecting such charges," 47 U. S. C. $ 203(a); and
when it makes it unlawful to "extend to any person any privileges or facilities in such communication, or employ or en524US1 Unit: $U84 [09-06-00 20:39:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court

force any classifications, regulations, or practices affectingsuch charges" except those set forth in the tariff, $ 203(c).

Unsurprisingly, the cases decided under the ICA make itclear that discriminatory "privileges" come in many guises,
and are not limited to discounted rates. "[A] preference orrebate is the necessary result of every violation of [the analog to $ 203(c) in the ICA] where the carrier renders or paysfor a service not covered by the prescribed tariffs."

UnitedStates v. Wabash R. Co., 321 U. S. 403, 412-413 (1944). In

Chicago & Alton R. Co. v. Kirby, 225 U. S. 155 (1912), werejected a shipper's breach-of-contract claim against a railroad for failure to ship a carload of race horses by a particu-larly fast train. We held that the contract was invalid as a
matter of law because the carrier's tariffs "did not providefor an expedited service, nor for transportation by any particular train," and therefore the shipper received "an undueadvantage . . . that is not one open to others in the same
situation." Id., at 163, 165. Similarly, in Davis v. Cornwell,264 U. S. 560 (1924), we invalidated the carrier's agreement
to provide the shipper with a number of railroad cars on aspecified day; such a special advantage, we said, "is illegal,
when not provided for in the tariff." Id., at 562. See alsoKansas City Southern R. Co. v. Carl, supra, at 653; Wight
v. United States, 167 U. S. 512, 517-518 (1897); I. Lake, Dis-crimination by Railroads and Other Public Utilities 310-315
(1947). III

The Ninth Circuit distinguished the Court's filed ratecases involving claims for special services on the ground that
the services at issue there "should have been included in thetariff and made available to all" because "the customer
would have been expected to pay a higher rate" for thoseservices. 108 F. 3d, at 989, n. 9. But that is precisely the
case here. Indeed, the additional services and guaranteesthat respondent claims it was entitled to by virtue of Ms.
Kisor's representations and petitioner's sales brochures--

Opinion of the Court
viz., faster provisioning, the allocation of charges throughmultilocation billing, and various matters relating to deposits, calling cards, and service support, see 108 F. 3d, at 987-988--all pertain to subjects that are

specifically addressed
by the filed tariff. See AT&T Tariff FCC No. 1, $ 2.5.10
(provisioning of orders); $ 6.2.4 (allocation of charges); $ 2.5.6(deposits); $ 2.5.12.B (calling cards); $ 6.2.5 (service supports).

The Ninth Circuit agreed that all of respondent's claimsexcept those relating to provisioning and billing would be
pre-empted if the filed rate doctrine applied. 108 F. 3d, at990. But even provisioning and billing are, in the relevant
sense, "covered" by the tariff. For example, whereas respondent asks to enforce a guarantee that orders would be
provisioned within 30 to 90 days, the tariff leaves it up to
petitioner to "establis[h] and confir[m]" a due date for provisioning, requires that petitioner merely make "every reasonable effort" to meet that due date, and if it fails gives the
customer no recourse except to "cancel the order without
penalty or payment of nonrecurring charges." $ 2.5.10(B).
Faster, guaranteed provisioning of orders for the same rate
is certainly a privilege within the meaning of 47 U. S. C.

$ 203(c) and the filed rate doctrine. Cf. Chicago & Alton
R. Co. v. Kirby, supra, at 163 (refusing to enforce promise for faster, guaranteed service not included in the tariff).
As for billing, whereas respondent claims that, pursuant to
the MLB option, petitioner promised to allocate usage and
charges accurately among respondent's customers, the tariff
provides that petitioner "will not allocate . . . usage or
charges" among the locations on the customer's network
and "is not responsible for the way that the Customer may
allocate usage or charges." AT&T Tariff FCC No. 1, $ 6.2.4.
Any assurance by petitioner that it would allocate usage and
charges and take responsibility for the task would have been
in flat contradiction of the tariff. See Chesapeake & Ohio
R. Co. v. Westinghouse, Church, Kerr & Co., 270 U. S. 260,
266 (1926).

v. CENTRAL OFFICE TELEPHONE, INC.

Opinion of the Court

The Ninth Circuit distinguished respondent's claims fromthose in our filed-rate cases involving special services in one

other respect: according to respondent, the "special services"that it sought were provided by petitioner, without charge,
to other customers, 108 F. 3d, at 989, n. 9. Even if that wereso, the claim for these services would still be pre-empted
under the filed rate doctrine. To the extent respondent isasserting discriminatory treatment, its remedy is to bring
suit under $ 202 of the Communications Act.1 To the extentpetitioner is claiming that its own claims for special services
are not really special because other companies get the samepreferences, "that would only tend to show that the practice
was unlawful [with regard to] the others as well." United
States v. Wabash R. Co., supra, at 413. Because respondentasks for privileges not included in the tariff, its state-law

claims are barred in either case.

IV
Our analysis applies with equal force to respondent'stortious-interference claim because that is wholly derivative of the contract claim for additional and better services.Respondent contended that the tort claim was based on
"AT&T's refusal to provide [respondent] with certain typesof service" and the Magistrate Judge agreed, noting that
" `the claims in this case, even the tort claim, . . . stem fromthe alleged failure of AT&T to comply with its contractual
relationship.' " 2 Brief for Appellant in Nos. 94-36116, 94-

1 Eight months after the close of discovery (and well after the 2-year
statute of limitations in the Communications Act, $ 415), respondent
sought leave to file a second amended complaint to add a $ 202 claim. The
Magistrate Judge denied the request. Respondent did not appeal that
ruling.

2 The dissent argues that "the jury's verdict on respondent's tort claim

is supported by evidence that went well beyond, and differed in nature
from, the contract claim," post, at 231, which the dissent asserts requires
us to remand this case rather than reverse the judgment. This issue of
noncontract evidence neither was included within the question presented

Opinion of the Court
36156 (CA9), p. 33. Respondent can no more obtain unlaw-ful preferences under the cloak of a tort claim than it can by

contract. "The rights as defined by the tariff cannot be var-ied or enlarged by either contract or tort of the carrier."
Keogh v. Chicago & Northwestern R. Co., 260 U. S. 156, 163(1922); see also

Maislin, 497 U. S., at 126.The saving clause of the Communications Act, $ 414, contrary to respondent's reading of it, does not dictate a differ-ent result. Section 414 copies the saving clause of the ICA,
and we have long held that the latter preserves only thoserights that are not inconsistent with the statutory filed-tariff
requirements. Adams Express Co. v. Croninger, 226 U. S.491, 507 (1913). A claim for services that constitute unlawful preferences or that directly conflict with the tariff--thebasis for both the tort and contract claims here--cannot be
"saved" under $ 414. "Th[e saving] clause . . . cannot in rea-son be construed as continuing in [customers] a common law

for our review ("Whether . . . the Ninth Circuit improperly allowed statelaw contract and tort claims based on a common carrier's failure to honor
an alleged side agreement to give its customer better service than called
for by the carrier's tariff") nor was raised by respondent as an alternative
ground in support of the judgment. Nor has respondent ever suggested
the need for a remand, even though the petition for certiorari sought not
merely reversal, but summary reversal. In its brief on the merits, respondent argued that the intentional tort claim was not pre-empted because AT&T's willful breach of its contractual commitments was not protected by the filed rate doctrine. There was no hint of an argument that,
even if that willful breach could not form the basis for an action, other
alleged intentional acts sufficed to support the judgment below. At no
point has respondent disputed the Magistrate Judge's finding that the tort
claim is derivative of the contract claim, or the Ninth Circuit's description
of its tort claim as based on the fact that "because COT had promised
certain benefits of SDN to its customers, and because AT&T provided
competing services, any violation of AT&T's contractual duties constituted
tortious interference with COT's relationship with its customers." 108
F. 3d 981, 988 (1997). Contrary to the dissent's assertion, we have no
obligation to search the record for the existence of a nonjurisdictional
point not presented, and to consider a disposition (remand instead of reversal) not suggested by either side.

right, the continued existence of which would be absolutelyinconsistent with the provisions of the act. In other words,

the act cannot be held to destroy itself." Texas & Pacific R.Co. v. Abilene Cotton Oil Co., 204 U. S. 426, 446 (1907).

Finally, we reject respondent's argument that, even if thetariff exclusively governs the parties' relationship, the relief
awarded is consistent with the tariff, since AT&T TariffFCC No. 1, $ 2.3.1 provides that petitioner's "liability, if any,
for its willful misconduct is not limited by this tariff." Re-spondent reasons that, because the jury found that petitioner engaged in willful misconduct, the verdict does notconflict with the tariff. Section 2.3.1, however, cannot be
construed to do what the parties have no power to do. Itremoves only those limitations upon liability imposed by the
tariff, not those imposed by law. It is the CommunicationsAct that renders the promise of preferences unenforceable. The tariff can no more exempt the broken promiseof preference that is willful than it can the broken promise of preference that is unintentional. (In fact, perverselyenough, the willful breach displays a greater, if belated,
attempt to comply with the law.)

* * *Because respondent's state-law claims are barred by the

filed rate doctrine, we reverse the judgment of the NinthCircuit.

It is so ordered.
Justice O'Connor took no part in the consideration ordecision of this case.

Chief Justice Rehnquist, concurring.
The Court concludes that respondent's tortious interfer-ence claim is "wholly derivative of the contract claim" and

therefore barred by the filed rate doctrine. The Court ac-cepts the Magistrate Judge's finding to that effect,

ante, at226, and I agree: The acts of tortious interference asserted

524US1 Unit: $U84 [09-06-00 20:39:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Rehnquist, C. J., concurring
against AT&T amount to no more than an intentional refusal
to provide services to respondent in an amount or manner
contrary to the filed tariff.

I write separately to note that this finding is necessary to
the conclusion that respondent's state-law tort claim may not
proceed. As the majority correctly states, the filed rate
doctrine exists to protect the "antidiscriminatory policy
which lies at `the heart of the common-carrier section of the
Communications Act.' " Ante, at 223. Central to that antidiscriminatory policy is the notion that all purchasers of
services covered by the tariff will pay the same rate. The
filed rate doctrine furthers this policy by disallowing suits
brought to enforce agreements to provide services on terms
different from those listed in the tariff. This ensures that
the tariff governs the terms by which the common carrier
provides those services to its customers.

It is crucial to note, however, that this is all the tariff
governs. In order for the filed rate doctrine to serve its
purpose, therefore, it need pre-empt only those suits that
seek to alter the terms and conditions provided for in the
tariff. This is how the doctrine has been applied in the past.
In Chicago & Alton R. Co. v. Kirby, 225 U. S. 155 (1912), for
example, respondent entered into a contract with petitioner
to ship horses from Springfield, Illinois, to New York City
via a special fast train. The tariff that the petitioner had
filed "did not provide for an expedited service, nor for transportation by any particular train." Id., at 163. The Court
ruled that respondent's suit to enforce the special arrangement could not proceed:

"An advantage accorded by special agreement which affects the value of the service to the shipper and its cost
to the carrier should be published in the tariffs, and for
a breach of such a contract, relief will be denied, because
its allowance without such publication is a violation of
the act. It is also illegal because it is an undue advan524US1 Unit: $U84 [09-06-00 20:39:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Rehnquist, C. J., concurring

tage in that it is not one open to all others in the same
situation." Id., at 165.

In Keogh v. Chicago & Northwestern R. Co., 260 U. S. 156,
163 (1922), the question was not whether a separate contract
could be enforced, but rather whether petitioner could bring
an antitrust complaint challenging the rate that respondents
had filed in their tariff. The Court ruled that he could not:

"The legal rights of shipper as against carrier in respect
to a rate are measured by the published tariff. Unless
and until suspended or set aside, this rate is made, for all
purposes, the legal rate, as between carrier and shipper.
The rights as defined by the tariff cannot be varied or
enlarged by either contract or tort of the carrier."
Ibid. (emphasis added).

In this case respondent's contract claim seeks to enforce
side arrangements that it made with petitioner. Respondent contends that petitioner promised to provide it with
services on terms different from those listed in the tariff.
As the above cases make clear, the filed rate doctrine bars
such a claim. Respondent's tort claim is entirely derivative
of its contractual claim, and the Court is therefore correct in
concluding that the doctrine also bars the tort claim.

The tariff does not govern, however, the entirety of the
relationship between the common carrier and its customers.
For example, it does not affect whatever duties state law
might impose on petitioner to refrain from intentionally interfering with respondent's relationships with its customers
by means other than failing to honor unenforceable side
agreements, or to refrain from engaging in slander or libel,
or to satisfy other contractual obligations. The filed rate
doctrine's purpose is to ensure that the filed rates are the
exclusive source of the terms and conditions by which the
common carrier provides to its customers the services covered by the tariff. It does not serve as a shield against all

actions based in state law. It is with this understandingthat I join the Court's opinion.

Justice Stevens, dissenting.
Everyone agrees that respondent's tortious interferenceclaim would be barred by the filed rate doctrine if it is

"wholly derivative of the contract claim for additional and
better services." Ante, at 226 (majority opinion); ante, at228 (R

ehnquist, C. J., concurring). Moreover, it is true
that when the Magistrate Judge ruled that respondent's casewould not support a punitive damages award as a matter of

state law, he characterized the tort claim as "stem[ming]from the alleged failure of AT&T to comply with its contractual relationship." Tr. 2207. In my opinion, however, thejury's verdict on respondent's tort claim is supported by evidence that went well beyond, and differed in nature from,
the contract claim.

If petitioner, in an effort to appropriate respondent's customers, had included with each bill sent to a customer a
statement expressly characterizing respondent as an unethical, profit-hungry middleman, I would think it clear that the
filed rate doctrine would not constitute a defense to such
tortious conduct. The evidence in the record indicates that
a similar result was obtained by mailing bills to the customers that disclosed the markup that respondent obtained on
their calls.

Respondent's tort claim was also premised in part on testimony that AT&T used a telemarketer to contact respondent's
customers and, without their authorization, convert them to
AT&T's own long-distance service. Id., at 557-558. In rejecting AT&T's motion for a directed verdict on the tort
claim, the Magistrate recognized that this practice of "slamming" customers could "easily be a case of intentional interference" that would not necessarily also constitute breach of
contract. Id., at 2166-2167. Slamming was clearly a part
of the case presented in the District Court. There was an

Stevens, J., dissenting

allegation of slamming in respondent's amended complaint; 1in the District Court, AT&T's trial counsel took issue with

respondent's effort to make slamming "a big part of thiscase," id., at 2170, and said in closing argument that slamming "is the basis for this intentional interference" claim,
id., at 2921; and nothing in the jury instructions remotelysuggested that the tort claim required proof of broken promises by AT&T to provide additional services. Respondent'sevidence easily fits within the definition of intentional interference set forth in the jury charge:

"COT asserts that AT&T intentionally interfered withits business relations and expectations of future business relations with its customers, the end users of itsSDN service. In order to prevail on this claim, COT
must prove by a preponderance of the evidence, one,that COT had business relations with the probability of
future economic benefit. Two, that AT&T was awareof the relationships and expectation of future benefits.
Three, that AT&T intentionally interfered with COT'sbusiness relations. Four, that AT&T interfered for an
improper motive or by using improper means. And,five, that COT suffered economic injury as a result of
the interference." App. 71.
It may be the fact that the billing disclosures and slam-ming were the consequence of negligence rather than a deliberate plan to take over a network of customers that respond-ent had developed, but the jury concluded otherwise. It
found that petitioner acted intentionally and willfully in in-terfering with respondent's business relations. See ibid.

That finding is doubly significant.

incidents of unauthorized changes made in the designated carriers (`slamming') of COT's customers." App. 28.

2 The jury's $13 million damages award, reduced by the Magistrate

Judge to $1.154 million, did not differentiate between the contract and
tort claims.

Stevens, J., dissenting
First, as the Court acknowledges, ante, at 228, the jury'sfinding precludes a defense based on the provisions of the

tariff that purport to limit petitioner's liability. Second, andof greater importance, it determines that the most egregious
tortious conduct was not merely derivative of the contract
violations. Enforcement of respondent's state-law right tobe free from tortious interference with business relations

does not somehow award respondent an unlawful preferencethat should have been specified in the tariff (presumably in
return for an added fee or higher rate); it instead gives effectto a generally applicable right that petitioner is required, by
state law, to respect in dealing with all others, customers
and noncustomers alike. Thus, at least some of the tortious
interference occurred independently of the customer-carrier
relationship and would have been actionable even if respondent had never entered into a contract with AT&T.

The Court correctly states that the filed rate doctrine will
pre-empt some tort claims, but we have never before applied
that harsh doctrine to bar relief for tortious conduct with so
little connection to, or effect upon, the relationship governed
by the tariff. To the extent respondent's tort claim is based
on petitioner's billing disclosures and slamming practices, it
neither challenges the carrier's filed rates, as did the antitrust claim in Keogh v. Chicago & Northwestern R. Co., 260
U. S. 156 (1922), nor seeks a special service or privilege of
the sort requested in cases such as Chicago & Alton R. Co.
v. Kirby, 225 U. S. 155 (1912), and Davis v. Cornwell, 264
U. S. 560 (1924). More akin to this case is Nader v. Allegheny Airlines, Inc., 426 U. S. 290, 300 (1976), in which we
held that a common-law tort action for fraudulent misrepresentation against a federally regulated air carrier could "coexist" with the Federal Aviation Act. To a limited degree
it may be said that here, as in Nader, "any impact on rates
that may result from the imposition of tort liability or from
practices adopted by a carrier to avoid such liability would
be merely incidental." Ibid. If the Communications Act's

saving clause 3 means anything, it preserves state-law remedies against carriers on facts such as these.

The District Court and the Court of Appeals never considered whether respondent's tort claim is wholly derivative of
its contract claim for purposes of the filed rate doctrine,
because those courts mistakenly believed that even the contract claim was not covered by the doctrine. On my own
reading of the record, I think it clear that a portion of the
tort claim is not pre-empted. The Court should therefore
remand the case for a new trial rather than ordering judgment outright for AT&T.4

Although the Court holds broadly that respondent's tort
claim is totally barred, it declines to consider whether a portion of the claim might survive on remand because this issue
was not part of the question presented in the petition for
certiorari and was not specifically raised by respondent.
Ante, at 226-227, n. 2. The latter point is wholly irrelevant,
precisely because of the scope of the question presented.
The only question that we agreed to decide was whether the
filed rate doctrine pre-empts "state-law contract and tort
claims based on a common carrier's failure to honor an
alleged side agreement to give its customer better service
than called for by the carrier's tariff." Pet. for Cert. i. The
Court answers that legal question, and then decides an
additional, factual one: whether respondent's tort claim is
"based on" AT&T's "failure to honor an alleged side agreement," and thus is "wholly derivative" of the pre-empted
contract claim. In resolving that issue, the Court cannot

3 "Nothing in this chapter contained shall in any way abridge or alter
the remedies now existing at common law or by statute, but the provisions
of this chapter are in addition to such remedies." 47 U. S. C. $ 414.

4 Beyond the billing disclosures and slamming, respondent asserts that

AT&T also misappropriated customer information from respondent's confidential data base. Brief for Respondent 4. That basis for a tort remedy,
if supported by sufficient evidence, would also appear not to be pre-empted
by the filed rate doctrine.

simply rely on AT&T's bald assertion, supported only by astatement of the Magistrate taken out of context, that the

tort claim is "wholly derivative"; we have an obligationeither to study the record or at least to remand and allow
the lower courts to consider the proper application of thelegal rule to the facts of this case.

I respectfully dissent.

HOHN v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eighth circuit

No. 96-8986. Argued March 3, 1998--Decided June 15, 1998
Petitioner Hohn filed a motion under 28 U. S. C. $ 2255 to vacate his conviction for "use" of a firearm during a drug trafficking offense, 18 U. S. C.

$ 924(c)(1), claiming the evidence was insufficient to prove such "use"
under this Court's intervening decision in Bailey v. United States, 516
U. S. 137. While the motion was pending, Congress enacted the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, $ 102 of which
amends the statutory provision which had required state prisoners to
obtain a certificate of probable cause before appealing the denial of a
habeas petition. The amended provision specifies, inter alia, that an
appeal may not be taken to a court of appeals from the final order in a

$ 2255 proceeding, $ 2253(c)(1)(B), unless a circuit justice or judge issues
a certificate of appealability, $ 2253(c)(1), upon a substantial showing of
the denial of a constitutional right, $ 2253(c)(2). The District Court denied Hohn's motion, and he filed a notice of appeal, which the Eighth
Circuit treated as an application for a certificate of appealability. A
three-judge panel declined to issue a certificate, ruling that Hohn did
not satisfy $ 2253(c)(2). In the panel's view, Bailey simply interpreted

$ 924(c)(1), and a district court's incorrect application of a statute does
not violate the Constitution. Hohn then petitioned for review of the
certificate denial under 28 U. S. C. $ 1254(1), which provides in relevant
part that "[c]ases in the courts of appeals may be reviewed by the Supreme Court" "[b]y writ of certiorari." The Government now says that
Hohn's claim was, in fact, constitutional in nature and asks the Court to
vacate the judgment and remand so the Eighth Circuit can reconsider
in light of this concession. Since both parties argue that this Court has
jurisdiction, an amicus curiae was appointed to argue the contrary
position.

Held: This Court has jurisdiction under $ 1254(1) to review denials of applications for certificates of appealability by a circuit judge or a court of
appeals panel. Hohn's certificate application is a "case in" the Court of
Appeals under $ 1254(1) because the word "case," as used in a statute,
means a court proceeding, suit, or action, Blyew v. United States, 13
Wall. 581, 595; the dispute here is a proceeding seeking relief for an
immediate and redressable injury, i. e., wrongful detention in violation
of the Constitution; and there is adversity as well as the other requisite

Syllabus
qualities of a "case." That $ 2253(c)(1) permits the certificate to be issued by a "circuit justice or judge" does not mean the judge's denial of
a certificate is his or her own action, rather than the court's. The fact
that Hohn's application moved through the Eighth Circuit in the same
manner as cases in general do, yielding a decision that has been regarded in that court as precedential, suggests the application was as
much a case in the Court of Appeals as any other matter. This conclusion is also confirmed by the adoption by every Court of Appeals but
one of rules governing the disposition of certificate applications; by the
issuance of the order denying Hohn's certificate in the name of the court
and under its seal; by Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 22(b), which
specifically provides for consideration of certificate applications by the
entire court of appeals; by Federal Rule 27(c), which authorizes the
court of appeals to review decisions that individual judges are authorized to make on their own; by Eighth Circuit Rule 27B(b)(2), which lists
grants of probable cause certificates by individual judges as reviewable
decisions under Rule 27(c); and by the uniform practice of the courts of
appeals, see In re Burwell, 350 U. S. 521, 522. Early cases acknowledging that this Court may not review a federal judge's actions performed
in an administrative, as opposed to a judicial, capacity, see, e. g., United
States v. Ferreira, 13 How. 40, 51-52, are inapposite because certificate
application decisions are judicial in nature. The contention of the dissent and the Court-appointed amicus that the failure to satisfy a threshold prerequisite for court of appeals jurisdiction, such as the issuance of
a certificate of appealability, prevents a case from ever being "in" that
court under $ 1254(1) is foreclosed by precedent. See, e. g., Ex parte
Quirin, 317 U. S. 1, 24; Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 731, 742-743, and
n. 23; and Automobile Workers v. Scofield, 382 U. S. 205, 208-209. The
argument is also refuted by the recent amendment to $ 2244(b)(3)(E)
barring certiorari review of court of appeals denials of motions to file
second or successive habeas applications, which would have been superfluous were such a motion not a case in the court of appeals for $ 1254(1)
purposes, see, e. g., Kawaauhau v. Geiger, 523 U. S. 57, 62, and which
contrasts tellingly with the absence of an analogous limitation on certiorari review of denials of appealability certificate applications, see, e. g.,
Bates v. United States, 522 U. S. 23, 29-30. Today's holding conforms
the Court's commonsense practice to the statutory scheme, making it
unnecessary to invoke the Court's extraordinary jurisdiction in routine
cases, which present important and meritorious claims such as Hohn's.
Although the decision directly conflicts with the portion of House v.
Mayo, 324 U. S. 42, 48 (per curiam), holding this Court lacks statutory
certiorari jurisdiction to review denials of certificates of probable cause,
stare decisis does not require adherence to that erroneous conclusion,

ing applications for certificates of appealability. The Court,we hold, does have jurisdiction.

I
In 1992, petitioner Arnold Hohn was charged with a num-ber of drug-related offenses, including the use or carrying of

a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking offense,18 U. S. C. $ 924(c)(1). Over defense counsel's objection, the
District Court instructed the jury that "use" of a firearmmeant having the firearm "available to aid in the commission
of " the offense. App. 7, 32. The jury convicted Hohn on allcounts. Hohn did not challenge the instruction in his direct
appeal, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. United States v.
Hohn, 8 F. 3d 1301 (CA8 1993).Two years after Hohn's conviction became final, we held

the term "use" in $ 924(c)(1) required active employment ofthe firearm. Proximity and accessibility alone were not sufficient. Bailey v. United States, 516 U. S. 137 (1995). Hohnfiled a

pro se motion under 28 U. S. C. $ 2255 to vacate his18 U. S. C. $ 924(c)(1) conviction in light of Bailey on the

grounds the evidence presented at his trial was insufficientto prove use of a firearm. Although the Government conceded the jury instruction given at Hohn's trial did not com-ply with

Bailey, the District Court denied relief because, inits view, Hohn had waived the claim by failing to challenge

the instruction on direct appeal.While Hohn's motion was pending before the District
Court, Congress enacted the Antiterrorism and EffectiveDeath Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214. Section 102 of AEDPA amends the statutory provision whichhad required state prisoners to obtain a certificate of probable cause before appealing the denial of a habeas petition.The amended provision provides:

"Unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate ofappealability, an appeal may not be taken to the court
of appeals from--

Opinion of the Court
"(A) the final order in a habeas corpus proceeding inwhich the detention complained of arises out of process

issued by a State court; or"(B) the final order in a proceeding under section
2255." 28 U. S. C. $ 2253(c)(1) (1994 ed., Supp. II).
Certificates of appealability may issue "only if the applicanthas made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right." $ 2253(c)(2).Hohn filed a notice of appeal on July 29, 1996, three months
after AEDPA's enactment. The Court of Appeals treatedthe notice of appeal as an application for a certificate of appealability and referred it to a three-judge panel. The paneldecided Hohn's application did not meet the standard for a

$ 2253(c) certificate. In the panel's view, "Bailey did nomore than interpret a statute, and an incorrect application
of a statute by a district court, or any other court, does notviolate the Constitution." 99 F. 3d 892, 893 (CA8 1996).
Given this determination, the panel declined to issue a cer-tificate of appealability.

Judge McMillian dissented. In his view, Bailey castdoubt on whether Hohn's conduct in fact violated 18 U. S. C.

$ 924(c)(1). The Due Process Clause, he reasoned, does not"tolerat[e] convictions for conduct that was never criminal,"
so Hohn had made a sufficient showing of a constitutionaldeprivation. 99 F. 3d, at 895. When the Court of Appeals
denied Hohn's rehearing petition and a suggestion for re-hearing en banc, four judges noted they would have granted
the suggestion.Hohn petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari to review the denial of the certificate, seeking to invoke our juris-diction under 28 U. S. C. $ 1254(1). The Government now
found itself in agreement with Hohn, saying his claim was,in fact, constitutional in nature. It asked us to vacate the
judgment and remand so the Court of Appeals could recon-sider in light of this concession. We may not vacate and
remand, of course, unless we first have jurisdiction over the

case; and since Hohn and the Government both argue infavor of our jurisdiction, we appointed an amicus curiae to

argue the contrary position. 522 U. S. 944 (1997).

II
Title 28 U. S. C. $ 1254 is the statute most often invokedfor jurisdiction in this Court. It provides in relevant part:

"Cases in the courts of appeals may be reviewed bythe Supreme Court by the following methods:
"(1) By writ of certiorari granted upon the petition ofany party to any civil or criminal case, before or after
rendition of judgment or decree."
The first phrase of the quoted statute confines our jurisdic-tion to "[c]ases in" the courts of appeals. Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 731, 741-742 (1982). The question is whetheran application for a certificate meets the description.

There can be little doubt that Hohn's application for acertificate of appealability constitutes a case under $ 1254(1).
As we have noted, "[t]he words `case' and `cause' are con-stantly used as synonyms in statutes . . . , each meaning
a proceeding in court, a suit, or action." Blyew v. United
States, 13 Wall. 581, 595 (1872). The dispute over Hohn'sentitlement to a certificate falls within this definition. It is

a proceeding seeking relief for an immediate and redressableinjury,

i. e., wrongful detention in violation of the Constitu-tion. There is adversity as well as the other requisite qualities of a "case" as the term is used in both Article III of theConstitution and the statute here under consideration. This
is significant, we think, for cases are addressed in the ordi-nary course of the judicial process, and, as a general rule,
when the district court has denied relief and applicable re-quirements of finality have been satisfied, the next step is
review in the court of appeals. That the statute permits thecertificate to be issued by a "circuit justice or judge" does
not mean the action of the circuit judge in denying the cer524US1 Unit: $U85 [09-14-00 16:49:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN
242 HOHN v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
tificate is his or her own action, rather than the action of thecourt of appeals to whom the judge is appointed.

The course of events here illustrates the point. The appli-cation moved through the Eighth Circuit in the same manner
as cases in general do. The matter was entered on the
docket of the Court of Appeals, submitted to a panel, anddecided in a published opinion, including a dissent. App.

4-5. The court entered judgment on it, issued a mandate,and entertained a petition for rehearing and suggestion for
rehearing en banc. Id., at 5-6. The Eighth Circuit hassince acknowledged its rejection of Hohn's application made
Circuit law. United States v. Apker, 101 F. 3d 75 (CA8
1996), cert. pending, No. 97-5460. One judge specifically
indicated he was bound by the decision even though he
believed it was wrongly decided. 101 F. 3d, at 75-76 (Henley, J., concurring in result). These factors suggest Hohn's
certificate application was as much a case in the Court of
Appeals as are the other matters decided by it.

We also draw guidance from the fact that every Court of
Appeals except the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has adopted Rules to govern the disposition
of certificate applications. E. g., Rules 22, 22.1 (CA1 1998);
Rules 22, 27(b) and (f) (CA2 1998); Rules 3.4, 22.1, 111.3(b)
and (c), 111.4(a) and (b)(vii) (CA3 1998); Rules 22(a) and
(b)(3)(g), 34(b) (CA4 1998); Rules 8.1(g), 8.6, 8.10, 22, 27.2.3
(CA5 1998); Rules 28(f), (g), and ( j) (CA6 1998); Rules
22(a)(2), (h)(2), and (h)(3)(i), 22.1 (CA7 1998); Rules 22A(d),
27B(b)(2) and (c)(2) (CA8 1998); Rules 3-1(b), 22-2, 22-3(a)(3)
and (b)(4), 22-4(c), 22-5(c), (d)(1), (d)(3), and (e) (CA9 1998);
Rules 11.2(b), 22.1, 22.2.3 (CA10 1998); Rules 22-1, 22-3(a)(3),
(a)(4), (a)(6), and (a)(7), and (b), 27-1(d)(3) (CA11 1998). We
also note the Internal Operating Procedures for the Court of
Appeals for the Eighth Circuit require certificate applications to be heard as a general matter by three-judge administrative panels. Internal Operating Procedures, pt. I.D.3
(1998); see also Interim Processing Guidelines for Certifi524US1 Unit: $U85 [09-14-00 16:49:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN

These directives would be meaningless if applications forcertificates of appealability were not matters subject to the
control and disposition of the courts of appeals.It is true the President appoints "circuit judges for the
several circuits," 28 U. S. C. $ 44, but it is true as well thecourt of appeals "consist[s] of the circuit judges of the circuit
in regular active service," $ 43. In this instance, as in allother cases of which we are aware, the order denying the
certificate was issued in the name of the court and under itsseal. That is as it should be, for the order was judicial in
character and had consequences with respect to the finalityof the order of the District Court and the continuing jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals.The Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure make specific
provision for consideration of applications for certificates ofappealability by the entire court. Rule 22(b) states:

"In a habeas corpus proceeding in which the detentioncomplained of arises out of process issued by a State
court, an appeal by the applicant for the writ may notproceed unless a district or a circuit judge issues a certificate of appealability pursuant to section 2253(c) oftitle 28, United States Code. . . . If the district judge has
denied the certificate, the applicant for the writ maythen request issuance of the certificate by a circuit

judge. If such a request is addressed to the court ofappeals, it shall be deemed addressed to the judges

thereof and shall be considered by a circuit judge orjudges as the court deems appropriate. If no express
request for a certificate is filed, the notice of appeal shallbe deemed to constitute a request addressed to the
judges of the court of appeals."
On its face, the Rule applies only to state, and not federal,prisoners. It is nonetheless instructive on the proper construction of $ 2253(c).Rule 22(b) by no means prohibits application to an individual judge, nor could it, given the language of the statute.There would be incongruity, nevertheless, were the same
ruling deemed in one instance the order of a judge actingex curia and in a second the action of the court, depending

upon the caption of the application or the style of the order.Our conclusion is further confirmed by Federal Rule of
Appellate Procedure 27(c). It states:

"In addition to the authority expressly conferred bythese rules or by law, a single judge of a court of appeals

may entertain and may grant or deny any request forrelief which under these rules may properly be sought
by motion, except that a single judge may not dismissor otherwise determine an appeal or other proceeding,
and except that a court of appeals may provide by orderor rule that any motion or class of motions must be acted
upon by the court. The action of a single judge may bereviewed by the court."

As the Rule makes clear, even when individual judges areauthorized under the Rules to entertain certain requests for
relief, the court may review their decisions. The EighthCircuit's Rules are even more explicit, specifically listing
grants of certificates of probable cause by an individual judgeas one of the decisions subject to revision by the court under
Federal Rule 27(c). Rule 27B(b)(2) (CA8 1998). The recog524US1 Unit: $U85 [09-14-00 16:49:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN

245Cite as: 524 U. S. 236 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
nition that decisions made by individual circuit judges re-main subject to correction by the entire court of appeals reinforces our determination that decisions with regard to anapplication for a certificate of appealability should be regarded as an action of the court itself and not of the individual judge. We must reject the suggestion contained in theAdvisory Committee's Notes on Federal Rule of Appellate

Procedure 22(b) that "28 U. S. C. $ 2253 does not authorizethe court of appeals as a court to grant a certificate of probable cause." 28 U. S. C. App., p. 609. It is more consistentwith the Federal Rules and the uniform practice of the
courts of appeals to construe $ 2253(c)(1) as conferring the
jurisdiction to issue certificates of appealability upon the
court of appeals rather than by a judge acting under his or
her own seal. See In re Burwell, 350 U. S. 521, 522 (1956).

Some early cases from this Court acknowledged a distinction between acting in an administrative and a judicial capacity. When judges perform administrative functions, their
decisions are not subject to our review. United States v.
Ferreira, 13 How. 40, 51-52 (1852); see also Gordon v. United
States, 117 U. S. Appx. 697, 702, 704 (1864). Those opinions
were careful to say it was the nonjudicial character of the
judges' actions which deprived this Court of jurisdiction.
Ferreira, supra, at 46-47 (tribunal not judicial when the proceedings were ex parte and did not involve the issuance of
process, summoning of witnesses, or entry of a judgment);
Gordon, supra, at 699, 702 (tribunal not judicial when it lacks
power to enter and enforce judgments). Decisions regarding applications for certificates of appealability, in contrast,
are judicial in nature. It is typical for both parties to enter
appearances and to submit briefs at appropriate times and
for the court of appeals to enter a judgment and to issue a
mandate at the end of the proceedings, as happened here.
App. 4-6. Construing the issuance of a certificate of appealability as an administrative function, moreover, would suggest an entity not wielding judicial power might review the

decision of an Article III court. In light of the constitu-tional questions which would surround such an arrangement,

see Gordon, supra; Hayburn's Case, 2 Dall. 409 (1792), weshould avoid any such implication.

We further disagree with the contention, advanced by the
dissent and by Court-appointed amicus, that a request toproceed before a court of appeals should be regarded as a

threshold inquiry separate from the merits which, if denied,prevents the case from ever being in the court of appeals.
Precedent forecloses this argument. In Ex parte Quirin,317 U. S. 1 (1942), we confronted the analogous question
whether a request for leave to file a petition for a writ of
habeas corpus was a case in a district court for the purposes
of the then-extant statute governing court of appeals review
of district court decisions. See 28 U. S. C. $ 225(a) First
(1940 ed.) (courts of appeals had jurisdiction to review final
decisions "[i]n the district courts, in all cases save where a
direct review of the decision may be had in the Supreme
Court"). We held the request for leave constituted a case in
the district court over which the court of appeals could assert jurisdiction, even though the district court had denied
the request. We reasoned, "[p]resentation of the petition
for judicial action is the institution of a suit. Hence the denial by the district court of leave to file the petitions in these
causes was the judicial determination of a case or controversy, reviewable on appeal to the Court of Appeals." 317
U. S., at 24.

We reached a similar conclusion in Nixon v. Fitzgerald.
There President Nixon sought to appeal an interlocutory
District Court order rejecting his claim of absolute immunity. The Court of Appeals summarily dismissed the appeal
because, in its view, the order failed to present a "serious
and unsettled question" of law sufficient to bring the case
within the collateral order doctrine announced in Cohen v.
Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U. S. 541, 547 (1949).

Opinion of the Court
satisfy this threshold jurisdictional requirement, respondentFitzgerald argued, "the District Court's order was not an

appealable `case' properly `in' the Court of Appeals withinthe meaning of $ 1254." 457 U. S., at 742. Turning aside
this argument, we ruled "petitioner did present a `serious
and unsettled' and therefore appealable question to theCourt of Appeals. It follow[ed] that the case was `in' the

Court of Appeals under $ 1254 and properly within ourcertiorari jurisdiction."

Id., at 743. We elaborated: "There
can be no serious doubt concerning our power to review acourt of appeals' decision to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction

. . . . If we lacked authority to do so, decisions to dismiss
for want of jurisdiction would be insulated entirely from
review by this Court." Id., at 743, n. 23; see also United
States v. Nixon, 418 U. S. 683, 692 (1974) (holding appeal of
District Court's denial of motion to quash subpoena duces
tecum was in the Court of Appeals for purposes of $ 1254(1)).

We have shown no doubts about our jurisdiction to review
dismissals by the Courts of Appeals for failure to file a timely
notice of appeal under $ 1254(1). The filing of a proper
notice of appeal is mandatory and jurisdictional. Torres v.
Oakland Scavenger Co., 487 U. S. 312, 315 (1988); United
States v. Robinson, 361 U. S. 220, 224 (1960); Advisory Committee's Notes on Fed. Rule App. Proc. 3, 28 U. S. C. App.,
p. 589. The failure to satisfy this jurisdictional prerequisite
has not kept the case from entering the Court of Appeals,
however. We have reviewed these dismissals often and
without insisting the petitioner satisfy the requirements for
an extraordinary writ and without suggesting our lack of
jurisdiction to do so. E. g., Houston v. Lack, 487 U. S. 266
(1988); Torres, supra; Fallen v. United States, 378 U. S. 139
(1964); United States v. Robinson, supra; Leishman v. Associated Wholesale Elec. Co., 318 U. S. 203 (1943).

tive agency. Automobile Workers v. Scofield, 382 U. S. 205,208-209 (1965); see also

Izumi Seimitsu Kogyo Kabushiki
Kaisha v. U. S. Philips Corp., 510 U. S. 27, 30 (1993) (per
curiam). Together these decisions foreclose the proposition
that the failure to satisfy a threshold prerequisite for court
of appeals jurisdiction, such as the issuance of a certificateof appealability, prevents a case from being in the court of

appeals for purposes of $ 1254(1).It would have made no difference had the Government declined to oppose Hohn's application for a certificate of appeal-ability. In

Scofield, we held that $ 1254(1) gave us jurisdiction to review the Court of Appeals' denial of a motion for
leave to intervene despite the fact that neither the agency
nor any of the other parties opposed intervention. 382 U. S.,
at 207. In the same manner, petitions for certiorari to this
Court are often met with silence or even acquiescence; yet
no one would suggest this deprives the petitions of the adversity needed to constitute a case. Assuming, of course,
the underlying action satisfies the other requisites of a case,
including injury in fact, the circumstance that the question
before the court is a preliminary issue, such as the denial of
a certificate of appealability or venue, does not oust appellate
courts of the jurisdiction to review a ruling on the matter.
For instance, a case does not lack adversity simply because
the remedy sought from a particular court is dismissal for
improper venue rather than resolution of the merits. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(3) specifically permits a
party to move to dismiss for improper venue before joining
issue on any substantive point through the filing of a responsive pleading, and we have long treated appeals of dismissals
for improper venue as cases in the courts of appeals, see,
e. g., Radzanower v. Touche Ross & Co., 426 U. S. 148, 151
(1976); Brunette Machine Works, Ltd. v. Kockum Industries,
Inc., 406 U. S. 706, 707 (1972); Schnell v. Peter Eckrich &
Sons, Inc., 365 U. S. 260, 261 (1961); Fourco Glass Co. v.

sissippi Publishing Corp. v. Murphree, 326 U. S. 438, 440(1946). It is true we have held appellate jurisdiction improper when district courts have denied, rather thangranted, motions to dismiss for improper venue. The jurisdictional problem in those cases, however, was the interlocutory nature of the appeal, not the absence of a proper case.
Lauro Lines s.r.l. v. Chasser, 490 U. S. 495 (1989); Van
Cauwenberghe v. Biard, 486 U. S. 517 (1988). In any event,concerns about adversity are misplaced in this case. Here

the Government entered an appearance in response to theinitial application and filed a response opposing Hohn's petition for rehearing and suggestion for rehearing en banc.
App. 4, 5.

The argument that this Court lacks jurisdiction under

$ 1254(1) to review threshold jurisdictional inquiries is
further refuted by the recent amendment to 28 U. S. C.

$ 2244(b)(3). The statute requires state prisoners filing second or successive habeas applications under $ 2254 to first
"move in the appropriate court of appeals for an order
authorizing the district court to consider the application."
28 U. S. C. $ 2244(b)(3)(A) (1994 ed., Supp. II). The statute
further provides "[t]he grant or denial of an authorization
by a court of appeals to file a second or successive application shall not be appealable and shall not be the subject
of a petition for rehearing or for a writ of certiorari."

$ 2244(b)(3)(E). It would have been unnecessary to include
a provision barring certiorari review if a motion to file a
second or successive application would not otherwise have
constituted a case in the court of appeals for purposes of
28 U. S. C. $ 1254(1). We are reluctant to adopt a construction making another statutory provision superfluous. See,
e. g., Kawaauhau v. Geiger, 523 U. S. 57, 62 (1998); United

States v. Menasche, 348 U. S. 528, 538-539 (1955).

Inclusion of a specific provision barring certiorari review
of denials of motions to file second or successive applications
is instructive for another reason. The requirements for cer524US1 Unit: $U85 [09-14-00 16:49:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN
250 HOHN v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
tificates of appealability and motions for second or successiveapplications were enacted in the same statute. The clear

limit on this Court's jurisdiction to review denials of motionsto file second or successive petitions by writ of certiorari
contrasts with the absence of an analogous limitation to certiorari review of denials of applications for certificates of ap-pealability. True, the phrase concerning the grant or denial

of second or successive applications refers to an action "bya court of appeals"; still, we think a Congress concerned
enough to bar our jurisdiction in one instance would havebeen just as explicit in denying it in the other, were that its
intention. See, e. g., Bates v. United States, 522 U. S. 23,
29-30 (1997) (" `[W]here Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress
acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or
exclusion' ") (quoting Russello v. United States, 464 U. S. 16,
23 (1983) (other internal quotation marks omitted)). The
dissent claims the absence of similar language in $ 2253(c)
can be explained by Congress' reliance on the rule holding
certificate applications unreviewable under $ 1254(1). Post,
at 261-262. As we later discuss, any such reliance is lessened by the Court's consistent practice of treating denials
of certificate applications as falling within its statutory certiorari jurisdiction. See infra, at 252.

Today's holding conforms our commonsense practice to the
statutory scheme, making it unnecessary to invoke our extraordinary jurisdiction in routine cases, which present important and meritorious claims. The United States does not
dispute that Hohn's claim has considerable merit and acknowledges that the trial court committed an error of constitutional magnitude. The only contested issue is whether the
constitutional violation was a substantial one. Brief in Opposition 7-8. Were we to adopt the position advanced by
the dissent, the only way we could consider his meritorious
claim would be through the All Writs Act, 28 U. S. C.

Opinion of the Court

$ 1651(a). Our rule permits us to carry out our normal func-tion of reviewing possible misapplications of law by the

courts of appeals without having to resort to extraordinaryremedies.

Our decision, we must acknowledge, is in direct conflict
with the portion of our decision in House v. Mayo, 324 U. S.42, 44 (1945)

(per curiam), holding that we lack statutory
certiorari jurisdiction to review refusals to issue certificatesof probable cause. Given the number and frequency of the

cases, and the difficulty of reconciling our practice with arequirement that only an extraordinary writ can be used to
address them, we do not think stare decisis concerns require
us to adhere to that decision. Its conclusion was erroneous,
and it should not be followed.

Stare decisis is "the preferred course because it promotes
the evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of
legal principles, fosters reliance on judicial decisions, and
contributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process." Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 827 (1991).
"Considerations of stare decisis have special force in the area
of statutory interpretation, for here, unlike in the context of
constitutional interpretation, the legislative power is implicated, and Congress remains free to alter what we have
done." Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164,
172-173 (1989).

We have recognized, however, that stare decisis is a "principle of policy" rather than "an inexorable command."
Payne, supra, at 828. For example, we have felt less constrained to follow precedent where, as here, the opinion was
rendered without full briefing or argument. Gray v. Mississippi, 481 U. S. 648, 651, n. 1 (1987) (questioning the precedential value of Davis v. Georgia, 429 U. S. 122 (1976) (per
curiam)). The role of stare decisis, furthermore, is "somewhat reduced . . . in the case of a procedural rule . . . which
does not serve as a guide to lawful behavior." United States
v. Gaudin, 515 U. S. 506, 521 (1995) (citing Payne, supra, at

Opinion of the Court
828). Here we have a rule of procedure that does not alterprimary conduct. And what is more, the rule of procedure

announced in House v. Mayo has often been disregarded inour own practice. Both Hohn and the United States cite
numerous instances in which we have granted writs of
certiorari to review denials of certificate applications with-out requiring the petitioner to move for leave to file for an

extraordinary writ, as previously required by our rules, andwithout requiring any extraordinary showing or exhibiting
any doubts about our jurisdiction to do so. 17 C. Wright, A.Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure $ 4036,
pp. 15-16 (2d ed. 1988) (collecting cases). Included among
these examples are several noteworthy decisions which resolved significant issues of federal law. See, e. g., Allen v.
Hardy, 478 U. S. 255, 257-258 (1986) (per curiam) (refusing
to permit retroactive application of Batson v. Kentucky, 476
U. S. 79 (1986), on collateral attack); Lynce v. Mathis, 519
U. S. 433, 436 (1997) (holding the cancellation of early release
credits violated the Ex Post Facto Clause). These deviations have led litigants and the legal community to question the vitality of the rule announced in House v. Mayo. As
commentators have observed: "More recent cases . . . have
regularly granted certiorari following denial of leave to
proceed in forma pauperis, or refusal to certify probable
cause, without any indication that review was by common
law writ rather than statutory certiorari. At least as to
these two questions, statutory certiorari should be available." Wright, Miller, & Cooper, supra, at 15-16 (footnotes
omitted). Our frequent disregard for the rule announced in
House v. Mayo weakens the suggestion that Congress could
have placed significant reliance on it, especially in light of
the commentary on our practice in the legal literature.

This is not to say opinions passing on jurisdictional issues
sub silentio may be said to have overruled an opinion addressing the issue directly. See, e. g., United States v. More,
3 Cranch 159, 172 (1805) (Marshall, C. J.). Our decisions re524US1 Unit: $U85 [09-14-00 16:49:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN

main binding precedent until we see fit to reconsider them,
regardless of whether subsequent cases have raised doubts
about their continuing vitality. Rodriguez de Quijas v.
Shearson/American Express, Inc., 490 U. S. 477, 484 (1989).
Once we have decided to reconsider a particular rule, however, we would be remiss if we did not consider the consistency with which it has been applied in practice. Swift & Co.
v. Wickham, 382 U. S. 111, 116 (1965); see also Brown Shoe
Co. v. United States, 370 U. S. 294, 307 (1962). This consideration, when combined with our analysis of the legal issue
in question, convinces us the contrary holding of House v.
Mayo cannot stand.

We hold this Court has jurisdiction under $ 1254(1) to review denials of applications for certificates of appealability
by a circuit judge or a panel of a court of appeals. The portion of House v. Mayo holding this Court lacks statutory certiorari jurisdiction over denials of certificates of probable
cause is overruled. In light of the position asserted by the
Solicitor General in the brief for the United States filed August 18, 1997, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further consideration
consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered.

Justice Souter, concurring.
I would be content to decide this case on the authority of
House v. Mayo, 324 U. S. 42 (1945) (per curiam), that
common-law certiorari is available to review the denial of
the certificate, leaving House's precarious future for another
day when its precedential value might have to be faced
squarely. But that course would command no more than a
minority of one, and there is good reason to deny it even that
support. House's holding on what may be " `in' the court of
appeals," id., at 44, was virtually unreasoned, and the Court
correctly notes our subsequent practice of honoring this rule
in the breach. Given the weakness of the precedent, the

of appealability persuades me to join the others in overrulingHouse insofar as it would bear on issuance of a statutory

Justice Scalia, with whom The Chief Justice, Justice O'Connor, and Justice Thomas join, dissenting.

Today's opinion permits review where Congress, with un-mistakable clarity, has denied it. To reach this result, the

Court ignores the obvious intent of the Antiterrorism andEffective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), Pub. L. 104-
132, 110 Stat. 1214, distorts the meaning of our own juris-dictional statute, 28 U. S. C. $ 1254(1), and overrules a 53-
year-old precedent, House v. Mayo, 324 U. S. 42 (1945) (percuriam). I respectfully dissent.

I
This Court's jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C. $ 1254(1) is lim-ited to "[c]ases in the courts of appeals." Section 102 of

AEDPA provides that "[u]nless a circuit justice or judge is-sues a certificate of appealability, an appeal may not be taken
to the court of appeals from . . . the final order in a habeascorpus proceeding under section 2255," that is, a district
court habeas proceeding challenging federal custody. Peti-tioner, who is challenging federal custody under 28 U. S. C.

$ 2255, did not obtain a certificate of appealability (COA).By the plain language of AEDPA, his appeal "from" the district court's "final order" "may not be taken to the courtof appeals." Because it could not be taken

to the Court ofAppeals, it quite obviously was never in the Court of Appeals; and because it was never in the Court of Appeals, welack jurisdiction under $ 1254(1) to entertain it.

We have already squarely and explicitly endorsed thisstraightforward interpretation. In

House v. Mayo, 324U. S., at 44, involving the predecessors to $$ 1254(1) and

Scalia, J., dissenting
2253(c)(1), the statutorily required certificate was called a
"certificate of probable cause" rather than a certificate of appealability, but the effect of failure to obtain it was precisely
the same: The case could not proceed to the court of appeals.
On an attempt to obtain review of denial of the certificate in
this Court, we held that since petitioner's "case was never
`in' the court of appeals, for want of a certificate," we lacked
jurisdiction under $ 1254(1). Ibid.

The Court concedes that House is squarely on point but
opts to overrule it because its "conclusion was erroneous,"
ante, at 251. The Court does not dispute that petitioner's

$ 2255 action was never in the Court of Appeals; its overruling of House is instead based on the proposition that petitioner's request for a COA is, in and of itself, a "case" within
the meaning of $ 1254(1), see ante, at 241-242, 246-249, and
that that case was "in" the Court of Appeals and hence can
be reviewed here, ante, at 241-246. Most of the Court's
analysis is expended in the effort to establish that petitioner
made his request for a COA to the Court of Appeals as such,
rather than to the circuit judges in their individual capacity,
ibid. Even that effort is unsuccessful, since it comes up
against the pellucid language of AEDPA to the contrary.
Section 102 does not permit application for a COA to a court
of appeals; it states that the application must be made to a
"circuit justice or judge." That this means precisely what it
says is underscored by $ 103 of AEDPA, which amends Rule
22 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure: "If [a COA]
request is addressed to the court of appeals, it shall be
deemed addressed to the judges thereof and shall be considered by a circuit judge or judges as the court deems appropriate." As though drafted in anticipatory refutation of the
Court's countertextual holding today, the Advisory Committee's Notes on Rule 22 explicitly state that "28 U. S. C. $ 2253
does not authorize the court of appeals as a court to grant a
certificate of probable cause." 28 U. S. C. App., p. 609.

256 HOHN v. UNITED STATES

Scalia, J., dissenting
Proclaiming the request for a COA to be "in" the Court ofAppeals is the most obvious of the Court's statutory distortions, but not the one with the most serious collateral conse-quences. The latter award goes to the Court's virtually unanalyzed pronouncement (also essential to its holding) that
the request for a COA was itself a "case" within the meaningof $ 1254(1). The notion that a request pertaining to a case

constitutes its own "case" for purposes of $ 1254 is a jaw-dropper. To support that remarkable assertion, the Court
relies upon circumstantial evidence--that the "applicationmoved through the Eighth Circuit in the same manner as
cases in general do." Ante, at 242. Does this mean that a
request for a COA would not be a "case" in those Circuits
that treated it differently--that permitted it to be disposed
of by a single judge as Rule 22 specifically allows? Does it
mean that a motion for recusal, or a request for televised
coverage, or a motion to file under seal would be a "case" if
the court of appeals chose to treat it in the manner the
Eighth Circuit treated the request for a COA here? Surely
not.

An application for a COA, standing alone, does not have
the requisite qualities of a legal "case" under any known
definition. It does not assert a grievance against anyone,
does not seek remedy or redress for any legal injury, and
does not even require a "party" on the other side. It is
nothing more than a request for permission to seek review.
Petitioner's grievance is with respondent for unlawful custody, and the remedy he seeks is release from that custody
pursuant to $ 2255. The request for a COA is not some separate "case" that can subsist apart from that underlying suit;
it is merely a procedural requirement that must be fulfilled
before petitioner's $ 2255 action--his "case" or "cause"--can
advance to the appellate court. The adversity which the
Court acknowledges is needed for a "case" under $ 1254, see
ante, at 241, is not satisfied by the dispute between petitioner
and respondent as to whether the COA should be granted--

Scalia, J., dissenting
any more than a "case or controversy" for purposes of initialfederal-court jurisdiction is created by a dispute over venue,

between parties who agree on everything else.1As is true with most erroneous theories, a logical and consistent application of the Court's reasoning yields strangeresults. If dispute over the propriety of granting a COA
creates a "case," the denial of a COA request that has beenunopposed (or, better yet, has been supported by the Government) will be unreviewable, whereas denial of a request thatis vigorously opposed will be reviewed--surely an upsidedown result. And the "case" concerning the COA will sub-sist even when the $ 2255 suit has been mooted by the petitioner's release from prison. These bizarre consequencesfollow inevitably from the Court's "separate case" theory,
which has been fabricated in order to achieve a result thatis fundamentally at odds with the purpose of the statute.
For the Court insists upon assuming, contrary to the plainimport of the statute, that Congress wanted petitioner's

$ 2255 action to proceed "in the ordinary course of the judi-cial process" and to follow the "general rule" that permits an
appeal from a final district court order, ibid. If this wereCongress's wish, there would have been no need for $ 102 of
AEDPA. The whole point of that provision is to divergefrom the ordinary course of the judicial process and to keep
petitioner's case against respondent out of the Court of Ap-peals unless petitioner obtains a COA. "The certificate is a
screening device, helping to conserve judicial (and prosecuto-rial) resources." Young v. United States, 124 F. 3d 794, 799

1 The Court has no response to this. Its observation that a dispute over
venue is not unreviewable simply because it is preliminary, ante, at 248-
249, is accurate but irrelevant. The issue is not whether a venue dispute
may be reviewed at all, but whether it may be reviewed in isolation from
some case of which it is a part. It may not, because a venue dispute,
standing alone--like a request for a COA, standing alone--lacks the requisite qualities of a case. If the entire $ 2255 proceeding was not "in" the
Court of Appeals, the COA request alone was not a "case" that $ 1254
authorizes us to review.

258 HOHN v. UNITED STATES

Scalia, J., dissenting
(CA7 1997). It is this unique screening function that distin-guishes a COA from the jurisdictional issues discussed by

the Court: Section 102 of AEDPA prevents petitioner's casefrom entering the Court of Appeals

at all in the absence of a
COA, whereas other jurisdictional determinations are made
after a case is in the Court of Appeals (even if the case islater dismissed because of jurisdictional defects),

ante, at 246-
249. See Rosado v. Wyman, 397 U. S. 397, 403, n. 3 (1970)(a court always has jurisdiction to determine its jurisdiction).

The Court's only response to these arguments is that theyare foreclosed by our precedent, since we decided an analogous issue in Ex parte Quirin, 317 U. S. 1 (1942). Ante, at
246. (The Court displays no appreciation of the delicious
irony involved in its insistence upon hewing to an allegedly
analogous decision while overruling the case directly in
point, House.) Quirin held that a petition for habeas corpus
constituted the institution of a suit, and that it was not necessary for the writ to issue for the matter to be considered a
case or controversy. 317 U. S., at 24. Quirin relied upon
our decision in Ex parte Milligan, 4 Wall. 2, 110-113 (1866),
which reasoned that a petition for habeas corpus is a suit
because the petitioner seeks " `that remedy which the law
affords him' " to recover his liberty. Id., at 113 (quoting
Weston v. City Council of Charleston, 2 Pet. 449, 464 (1829)).
Petitioner's request for $ 2255 relief is analogous to a petition
for habeas corpus, but his request for a COA is of a wholly
different nature. That is no "remedy" for any harm, but a
threshold procedural requirement that petitioner must meet
in order to carry his $ 2255 suit to the appellate stage. That
is why the Court in House, decided less than three years
after Quirin, did not treat the application for a certificate as
a separate case but did recognize the petition for habeas corpus as a case even though it was decided without a hearing
or a call for a return. 324 U. S., at 43.

I have described above why House was entirely correct,
but a few words are in order concerning the inappropriate524US1 Unit: $U85 [09-14-00 16:49:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Scalia, J., dissenting
ness of overruling House, regardless of its virtue as an origi-nal matter. "[T]he burden borne by the party advocating

abandonment of an established precedent is greater wherethe Court is asked to overrule a point of statutory construction." Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164,
172-173 (1989); see also Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431U. S. 720, 736 (1977);

Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285
U. S. 393, 406 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting). The Courtacknowledges this principle, but invokes cases of ours that

say that stare decisis concerns are " `somewhat reduced' " inthe case of a procedural rule.

Ante, at 251. The basis for
that principle, of course, is that procedural rules do not ordinarily engender detrimental reliance--and in this case, as I
shall discuss, detrimental reliance by the Congress of the
United States is self-evident. In any event, even those
cases cited by the Court as applying the "somewhat reduced"
standard to procedural holdings still felt the need to set forth
special factors justifying the overruling. United States v.
Gaudin, 515 U. S. 506, 521 (1995), concluded that "the decision in question had been proved manifestly erroneous, and
its underpinnings eroded, by subsequent decisions of this
Court"; and Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 828-830
(1991), noted that the overruled cases had been "decided by
the narrowest of margins, over spirited dissents challenging [their] basic underpinnings," had been "questioned by
Members of the Court in later decisions," and had "defied
consistent application by the lower courts."

The Court's next excuse is that House was decided without
full briefing or argument. The sole precedent it cites for the
proposition that this makes a difference is Gray v. Mississippi, 481 U. S. 648, 651, n. 1 (1987). Gray, however, did not
deny stare decisis effect to an opinion rendered without full
briefing and argument--it accorded stare decisis effect. Id.,
at 666-667. What the Court relies upon is the mere dictum,
rendered in the course of this opinion (and dictum in a footnote, at that), that "summary action here does not have the

524US1 Unit: $U85 [09-14-00 16:49:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN
260 HOHN v. UNITED STATES

Scalia, J., dissenting
same precedential effect as does a case decided upon fullbriefing and argument."

Id., at 651, n. 1. But the sole authority cited for that dictum was Edelman v. Jordan, 415U. S. 651 (1974), which declined to give

stare decisis effect,
not to opinions that had been issued without briefing and
argument, but to judgments that had been issued without
opinion--"summary affirmances" that did not "contain any
substantive discussion" of the point at issue or any other
point, id., at 670-671. Such judgments, affirming without
comment the disposition appealed from, were common in the
days when this Court had an extensive mandatory jurisdiction; they carried little more weight than denials of certiorari. House, by contrast, was a six-page opinion with substantive discussion on the point at issue here. It reasoned:
(1) "Our authority . . . extends only to cases `in a circuit court
of appeals . . . .' " (2) "Here the case was never `in' the court
of appeals," because of (3) "want of a certificate of probable
cause." 324 U. S., at 44.2 And it cited as authority Ferguson v. District of Columbia, 270 U. S. 633 (1926). The new
rule that the Court today announces--that our opinions rendered without full briefing and argument (hitherto thought
to be the strongest indication of certainty in the outcome)
have a diminished stare decisis effect--may well turn out to
be the principal point for which the present opinion will be
remembered. It can be expected to affect the treatment of
many significant per curiam opinions by the lower courts,
and the willingness of Justices to undertake summary disposition in the future.

2 The concurrence asserts that this analysis was "virtually unreasoned."
Ante, at 253 (opinion of Souter, J.). It seems to me, to the contrary, that
there was virtually nothing more to be said. Not until today has anyone
thought that a "case" could consist of a disembodied request to appeal.
The concurrence joins the Court in relying upon a truly eccentric argument, and then blames the House Court for not discussing this eccentricity
at length.

Scalia, J., dissenting
Of course even if one accepts that the two factors the
Court alludes to (procedural ruling plus absence of full
briefing or argument) reduce House's stare decisis effect, one
must still acknowledge that its stare decisis effect is increased by the fact that it was a statutory holding. The
Court does not contend that stare decisis is utterly inapplicable, and so it must come up with some reason for ignoring
it. Its reason is that we have "disregarded" House in practice. Ante, at 252. The opinions it cites for this proposition, however, not only fail to mention House; they fail to
mention the jurisdictional issue to which House pertains.
And "we have repeatedly held that the existence of unaddressed jurisdictional defects has no precedential effect."
Lewis v. Casey, 518 U. S. 343, 352, n. 2 (1996) (emphasis
added). Surely it constitutes "precedential effect" to reduce
the stare decisis effect of one of the Court's holdings. It is
significant, moreover, that when Members of the Court have
discussed House or the jurisdictional effect of a COA denial,
they have agreed that jurisdiction is not available under

$ 1254. See Davis v. Jacobs, 454 U. S. 911, 912 (1981) (Stevens, J., respecting denial of certiorari); id., at 916-917
(Rehnquist, J., joined by Burger, C. J., and Powell, J., dissenting); Jeffries v. Barksdale, 453 U. S. 914, 915-916 (1981)
(Rehnquist, J., joined by Burger, C. J., and Powell, J., dissenting). The Court's new approach to unaddressed jurisdictional defects is perhaps the second point for which the
present opinion will be remembered.

While there is scant reason for denying stare decisis effect
to House, there is special reason for according it: the reliance
of Congress upon an unrepudiated decision central to the
procedural scheme it was creating. Section 102 of AEDPA
continues a long tradition of provisions enacted by Congress
that limit appellate review of petitions. In 1908, Congress
required a certificate of probable cause in habeas corpus
cases involving state prisoners before an appeal would lie to

524US1 Unit: $U85 [09-14-00 16:49:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN
262 HOHN v. UNITED STATES

Scalia, J., dissenting
this Court, see Act of Mar. 10, 1908, ch. 76, 35 Stat. 40. In1925, this requirement was extended to intermediate appellate proceedings, see Act of Feb. 13, 1925, ch. 229, $$ 6(d), 13,43 Stat. 940, 942. Before 1925, this Court readily concluded
it had no jurisdiction over appeals brought before it in the
absence of a certificate, see, e. g., Bilik v. Strassheim, 212U. S. 551 (1908);

Ex parte Patrick, 212 U. S. 555 (1908), and
House interpreted the 1925 amendment to produce the sameeffect in the courts of appeals and, consequently, in this

Court under the predecessor to $ 1254(1). Quite obviously,with

House on the books--neither overruled nor even cited
in the later opinions that the Court claims "disregarded" it--Congress presumably anticipated that $ 102 of AEDPA

would be interpreted in the same manner.3 In yet anotherstriking departure from our ordinary practice, the Court
qualifies the rule that statutes are deemed to adopt the ex-tant holdings of this Court, see

Keene Corp. v. United States,
508 U. S. 200, 212 (1993): They will not be deemed to adopt
them, the Court says, when legal commentators "question

3 The Court points to the fact that another provision of AEDPA, which
requires court of appeals authorization before a state prisoner can file a
second or successive habeas petition in district court, specifically states
that the denial of the authorization "shall not be appealable and shall not
be the subject of a petition . . . for a writ of certiorari." 28 U. S. C.

$ 2244(b)(3)(E) (1994 ed., Supp. II). This provision, the Court says, would
be rendered "superfluous" if we followed House, ante, at 249. That is
not so. Section 2244(b)(3) addresses whether there will be district-court
consideration of a second or successive petition at all, not whether the
district court's consideration may be reviewed by an appellate court.
Only the latter is covered by the holding of House. It is true enough that
the reasoning of House, if carried over to the other question, would
produce the same result; but Congress's specification of that result when
there is no Supreme Court holding precisely in point would more accurately be described as cautious than superfluous. Indeed, the greater
relevance of $ 2244(b)(3) to the question before us is this: It would be exceedingly strange to foreclose certiorari review of the denial of all federal
intervention, as that provision does, while according certiorari review of
the denial of appeal from the federal district court to the court of appeals.

the vitality" of the holdings. Ante, at 252. The confusionthat will be introduced by this new approach is obvious.

At bottom, the only justification for the Court's holding--and the only one that prompts the concurrence to overrule
House--is convenience: it "permits us to carry out our nor-mal function" of appellate review.

Ante, at 251. Our "nor-mal" function of appellate review, however, is no more and

no less than what Congress says it is. U. S. Const., Art. III,$ 2. The Court's defiance of the scheme created by Congress
in evident reliance on our precedent is a display not of "com-mon sense," ante, at 250, but of judicial willfulness. And a
doctrine of stare decisis that is suspended when five Justicesfind it inconvenient (or indeed, as the concurrence suggests,
even four Justices in search of a fifth) is no doctrine at all,but simply an excuse for adhering to cases we like and abandoning those we do not. II

Since I find no jurisdiction under $ 1254(1), I must addressthe Government's further argument that we can issue a
common-law writ of certiorari under the All Writs Act, 28U. S. C. $ 1651. The All Writs Act provides that "[t]he
Supreme Court . . . may issue all writs necessary or appro-priate in aid of [its] jurisdictio[n] and agreeable to the usages
and principles of law." As expressly noted in this Court'sRule 20.1, issuance of a writ under $ 1651 "is not a matter of
right, but of discretion sparingly exercised," and "[t]o justifythe granting of any such writ, the petition must show that
the writ will be in aid of the Court's appellate jurisdiction,that exceptional circumstances warrant the exercise of the
Court's discretionary powers, and that adequate relief cannotbe obtained in any other form or from any other court."

Petitioner (who filed a petition for a writ of certiorariunder $ 1254(1), not under the All Writs Act, Pet. for Cert.
1) has failed to establish that he meets these requirements.To begin with, he has not shown that adequate relief is unobtainable in any form or from any other court. AEDPA dif524US1 Unit: $U85 [09-14-00 16:49:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Scalia, J., dissenting
fers from the gatekeeping statute at issue in House in a cru-cial respect: when House was decided, claimants could seek

certificates of probable cause only from "the United Statescourt by which the final decision was rendered or a judge of
the circuit court of appeals," 28 U. S. C. $ 466 (1940 ed.),
whereas $ 102 of AEDPA permits claimants to seek COA'sfrom a "circuit

justice or judge." Because petitioner may
obtain the relief he seeks from a circuit justice, relief underthe All Writs Act is not "necessary."

Relief under the Act is also not "appropriate." The onlycircumstance alleged by petitioner to justify relief is that the
Eighth Circuit erroneously concluded that he failed to pre-sent a substantial constitutional question. There is nothing
"exceptional" about this claim; it is in fact the same claim
available to every petitioner when a COA is denied, and en-tertaining it would render application for this "extraordinary" writ utterly routine. Issuance of the writ is not "ap-propriate" for another reason as well: It would frustrate the
purpose of AEDPA, which is to prevent review unless a COAis granted. "Where a statute specifically addresses the particular issue at hand, it is that authority, and not the AllWrits Act, that is controlling. Although that Act empowers
federal courts to fashion extraordinary remedies when the
need arises, it does not authorize them to issue ad hoc writswhenever compliance with statutory procedures appears inconvenient or less appropriate." Pennsylvania Bureau of
Correction v. United States Marshals Service, 474 U. S. 34,
43 (1985).4 * * *

The purpose of AEDPA is not obscure. It was to eliminate the interminable delays in the execution of state andfederal criminal sentences, and the shameful overloading of

"necessary" or "appropriate" under $ 1651, I need not discuss whether it
fails the further requirement that it be "in aid of" our jurisdiction.

our federal criminal justice system, produced by various as-pects of this Court's habeas corpus jurisprudence. And the

purpose of the specific provision of AEDPA at issue here isalso not obscure: It was designed, in intelligent reliance upon
a holding of this Court, to end $ 2255 litigation in the districtcourt unless a court of appeals judge or the circuit justice
finds reasonable basis to appeal. By giving literally unprec-edented meaning to the words in two relevant statutes, and

266 OCTOBER TERM, 1997

Syllabus

FORNEY v. APFEL, COMMISSIONER OFSOCIAL SECURITY
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 97-5737. Argued April 22, 1998--Decided June 15, 1998
Petitioner Forney sought judicial review of a Social Security Administration final determination denying her disability benefits. When the District Court found that determination inadequately supported by the evidence and remanded the case to the agency for further proceedings
pursuant to sentence four of 42 U. S. C. $ 405(g), Forney appealed, contending that the agency's denial of benefits should be reversed outright.
The Ninth Circuit, however, decided that she did not have the legal
right to appeal. Before this Court, both Forney and the Solicitor General agree that she had the right to appeal, so an amicus has been
appointed to defend the Ninth Circuit's decision.

Held: A Social Security disability claimant seeking court reversal of an

agency decision denying benefits may appeal a district court order remanding the case to the agency for further proceedings pursuant to
sentence four of 42 U. S. C. $ 405(g). This Court has previously held
that the language of the Social Security Act's "judicial review" provision--"district courts" (reviewing, for example, agency denials of disability claims) "have the power to enter . . . a judgment affirming, modifying or reversing [an agency] decision . . . with or without remanding
the cause for a rehearing," and such "judgment . . . shall be final except
that it shall be subject to review in the same manner as" other civil
action judgments, 42 U. S. C. $ 405(g) (emphases added)--means that a
district court order remanding a Social Security disability claim to the
agency for further proceedings is a "final judgment" appealable under
28 U. S. C. $ 1291. Sullivan v. Finkelstein, 496 U. S. 617. Finkelstein
differs from this case in that it involved an appeal by the Government.
However, Finkelstein's logic makes that feature irrelevant here. That
case reasoned, primarily from $ 405(g)'s language, that a district court
judgment remanding a Social Security disability case fell within the
"class of orders" that are appealable under $ 1291. Neither the statute
nor Finkelstein suggests that such an order could be final for purposes
of an appeal by the Government, but not a claimant, or permits an inference that finality turns on the order's importance, or the availability
of an avenue for appeal from the agency determination that might
emerge after remand. The Ninth Circuit erred in concluding that For524us1$86Z 02-17-99 18:23:51 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
ney could not appeal because she was the prevailing party. A party is
"aggrieved" and ordinarily can appeal a decision granting in part and
denying in part the remedy requested, United States v. Jose, 519 U. S.
54, 56; Forney, who sought reversal of the administrative decision denying benefits and, in the alternative, a remand, received some, but not
all, of the relief requested. The Solicitor General disputes the Ninth
Circuit's assertion that a rule permitting appeals in these circumstances
would impose additional, and unnecessary, burdens upon federal appeals
courts. If the Solicitor General proves wrong in his prediction, the
remedy must be legislative, for the statutes at issue do not give the
courts the power to redefine or subdivide the classes of cases where
appeals will (or will not) lie. Pp. 269-273.

108 F. 3d 228, reversed and remanded.

Breyer, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.

Ralph Wilborn argued the cause for petitioner. With himon the briefs were Tim Wilborn and Eric Schnaufer.

Lisa Schiavo Blatt argued the cause for respondent insupport of petitioner. With her on the briefs were Solicitor General Waxman, Assistant Attorney General Hunger,Deputy Solicitor General Kneedler, and William Kanter.

Allen R. Snyder, by invitation of the Court, 522 U. S. 1088(1998), argued the cause as

amicus curiae in support of thejudgment below.

Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court.
The question in this case is whether a Social Security dis-ability claimant seeking court reversal of an agency decision

denying benefits may appeal a district court order remand-ing the case to the agency for further proceedings. We conclude that the law authorizes such an appeal.

I
Sandra K. Forney, the petitioner, applied for Social Secu-rity disability benefits under $ 223 of the Social Security Act,

as added, 70 Stat. 815, and as amended, 42 U. S. C. $ 423. ASocial Security Administration Administrative Law Judge
(ALJ) determined (1) that Forney had not worked since the

Opinion of the Court
onset of her medical problem, and (2) that she was more thanminimally disabled, but (3) that she was not disabled enough

to qualify for benefits automatically. Moreover, her disabil-ity, (4) while sufficiently serious to prevent her return to her
former work (cook, kitchen manager, or baker), (5) was not
serious enough to prevent her from holding other jobs avail-able in the economy (such as order clerk or telephone answering service operator). App. 12-28. The ALJ conse-quently denied her disability claim,

id., at 28, and the
Administration's Appeals Council denied Forney's requestfor review, App. to Pet. for Cert. 39-40; see generally

Bowen
v. Yuckert, 482 U. S. 137, 140-142 (1987) (setting forth fivepart "disability" test); 20 CFR $ 404.1520 (1997) (same).

Forney then sought judicial review in Federal District
Court. The court found the agency's final determination--
that Forney could hold other jobs--inadequately supported
because those jobs "require frequent or constant reaching,"
but the record showed that Forney's "ability to reach is
impaired." Forney v. Secretary, Civ. No. 94-6357 (D. Ore.,
May 1, 1995); App. 127-128. The District Court then entered a judgment, which remanded the case to the agency for
further proceedings (pursuant to sentence four of 42 U. S. C.

$ 405(g)). Id., at 128.

Forney sought to appeal the remand order. She contended that, because the agency had already had sufficient
opportunity to prove the existence of other relevant employment (and for other reasons), its denial of benefits should
be reversed outright. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit did not hear her claim, however, for it decided
that Forney did not have the legal right to appeal. Forney
v. Chater, 108 F. 3d 228, 234 (1997).

Forney sought certiorari. Both she and the Solicitor General agreed that Forney had the legal right to appeal from
the District Court's judgment. The Solicitor General suggested that we reverse the Ninth Circuit and remand the
case so that it could hear Forney's appeal. We granted cer524us1$86Q 02-17-99 18:23:51 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
tiorari to consider the merits of this position, and we ap-pointed an amicus to defend the Ninth Circuit's decision.

We now agree with Forney and the Solicitor General thatthe Court of Appeals should have heard Forney's appeal.

II
Section 1291 of Title 28 of the United States Code grantsthe "courts of appeals . . . jurisdiction of appeals from all

final decisions of the district courts." (Emphasis added.)Forney's appeal falls within the scope of this jurisdictional
grant. That is because the District Court entered its judg-ment under the authority of the special "judicial review" provision of the Social Security Act, which says, in its fourthsentence, that "district court[s]" (reviewing, for example,
agency denials of Social Security disability claims)

"shall have power to enter . . . a judgment affirming,modifying, or reversing the decision of the [agency] with

or without remanding the cause for a rehearing," 42U. S. C. $ 405(g) (emphasis added),

and which adds, in its eighth sentence, that the

"judgment of the court shall be final except that it shall
be subject to review in the same manner as a judgmentin other civil actions," ibid. (emphases added).

This Court has previously held that this statutory languagemeans what it says, namely, that a district court order remanding a Social Security disability benefit claim to theagency for further proceedings is a "final judgment" for
purposes of $ 1291 and it is, therefore, appealable. Sullivanv. Finkelstein, 496 U. S. 617 (1990); see also Shalala v.
Schaefer, 509 U. S. 292, 294 (1993) (statute that requiresattorney's fees application to be filed within "thirty days of
final judgment" requires filing within 30 days of entry of$ 405(g) "sentence four" district court remand order, not
within 30 days of final agency decision after remand).

270 FORNEY v. APFEL

Opinion of the Court
Finkelstein is not identical to the case before us. It involved an appeal by the Government; this case involves an
appeal by a disability benefits claimant. Moreover, the need
for immediate appeal in Finkelstein was arguably greater
than that here. The District Court there had invalidated a
set of Health and Human Services regulations, and the Government might have found it difficult to obtain appellate review of this matter of general importance. Further, the
Court, in Finkelstein, said specifically that it would "express
no opinion about appealability" where a party seeks to "appeal on the ground that" the district court should have
granted broader relief. 496 U. S., at 623, n. 3.

Finkelstein's logic, however, makes these features of that
case irrelevant here. Finkelstein focused upon a "class of
orders" that Congress had made "appealable under $ 1291."
Id., at 628. It reasoned, primarily from the language of

$ 405(g), that a district court judgment remanding a Social
Security disability benefit case fell within that class. Nothing in the language, either of the statute or the Court's opinion, suggests that such an order could be "final" for purposes
of appeal only when the Government seeks to appeal but not
when the claimant seeks to do so. Nor does the opinion's
reasoning permit an inference that "finality" turns on the
order's importance or the availability (or lack of availability)
of an avenue for appeal from the different, later, agency determination that might emerge after remand.

The Ninth Circuit itself recognized that the District
Court's judgment was "final" for purposes of appeal, for it
said that any effort "to conclude" that a judgment remanding
the case is "not final for the claimant" was "inconsistent"
with Finkelstein. 108 F. 3d, at 232. The court added that
it would be "error for the district court to attempt to retain
jurisdiction" after remanding the case; and it wrote that the
remand judgment, which ended the "civil action," must be
" `final' in a formalistic sense . . . for all parties to it." Ibid.

271Cite as: 524 U. S. 266 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
The Court of Appeals nonetheless reached a "no appeal"conclusion--but on a different ground. It pointed out that

a "party normally may not appeal [a] decision in its favor."Ibid. (citing Electrical Fittings Corp. v. Thomas & Betts Co.,
307 U. S. 241, 242 (1939)). And it said that Forney had obtained a decision in her favor here. Because Forney "may,on remand, secure all of the relief she seeks," the court

wrote, she is a "prevailing" party and therefore cannot ap-peal. 108 F. 3d, at 232-233.

We do not agree. We concede that this Court has heldthat a "party who receives all that he has sought generally
is not aggrieved by the judgment affording the relief andcannot appeal from it."

Deposit Guaranty Nat. Bank v.
Roper, 445 U. S. 326, 333 (1980). But this Court also has
clearly stated that a party is "aggrieved" and ordinarily canappeal a decision "granting in part and denying in part the

remedy requested." United States v. Jose, 519 U. S. 54, 56(1996)

(per curiam). And this latter statement determines
the outcome of this case.Forney's complaint sought as relief:

"1. That this court reverse and set aside the decision . . .denying [the] claim for disability benefits;
"2. In the alternative, that this court remand the caseback to the Secretary for proper evaluation of the evidence or a hearing de novo." App. 37.
The context makes clear that, from Forney's perspective, the
second "alternative," which means further delay and risk,is only half a loaf. Thus, the District Court's order gives

petitioner some, but not all, of the relief she requested; andshe consequently can appeal the District Court's order insofar as it denies her the relief she has sought. Indeed, tohold to the contrary would deny a disability claimant the
right to seek reversal (instead of remand) through a crossappeal in cases where the Government itself appeals a re524us1$86Q 02-17-99 18:23:51 PAGES OPINPGT

mand order, as the Government has every right to do. See
Finkelstein, supra, at 619.

The Solicitor General points to many cases that find a rightto appeal in roughly comparable circumstances. See Brief

for Respondent 21, n. 12 (citing Gargoyles, Inc. v. United
States, 113 F. 3d 1572 (CA Fed. 1997) (permitting appealwhere prevailing party recovered reasonable royalty but was

Finally, we recognize that the Ninth Circuit expressedconcern that a rule of law permitting appeals in these circumstances would impose additional, and unnecessary, bur-dens upon federal appeals courts. The Solicitor General,
while noting that the federal courts reviewed nearly 10,000Social Security Administration decisions in 1996, says that
the "[p]ractical [c]onsequences" of permitting appeals "[a]relimited." Brief for Respondent 26; Reply Brief for Respondent 17, n. 13. Except for unusual cases, he believes, aclaimant obtaining a remand will prefer to return to the
agency rather than to appeal immediately seeking outrightagency reversal--because appeal means further delay, because the chance of obtaining reversal should be small, andbecause the appeal (if it provokes a Government crossappeal) risks losing all. Brief for Respondent 26-29.Regardless, as we noted in Finkelstein, congressional statutes governing appealability normally proceed by defining"classes" of cases where appeals will (or will not) lie. 496
U. S., at 628. The statutes at issue here do not give courtsthe power to redefine, or to subdivide, those classes, according to whether or not they believe, in a particular case, fur-ther agency proceedings might obviate the need for an immediate appeal. Thus, if the Solicitor General proves wrong inhis prediction, the remedy must be legislative in nature.

For these reasons, the judgment of the Ninth Circuit isreversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings
consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered.

GEBSER et al. v. LAGO VISTA INDEPENDENTSCHOOL DISTRICT
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fifth circuit

No. 96-1866. Argued March 25, 1998--Decided June 22, 1998
Petitioner Gebser, a high school student in respondent Lago Vista Independent School District, had a sexual relationship with one of her teachers. She did not report the relationship to school officials. After the
couple was discovered having sex and the teacher was arrested, Lago
Vista terminated his employment. During this time, the district had
not distributed an official grievance procedure for lodging sexual harassment complaints or a formal antiharassment policy, as required by federal regulations. Gebser and her mother, also a petitioner here, filed
suit raising, among other things, a claim for damages against Lago Vista
under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which provides
in pertinent part that a person cannot "be subjected to discrimination
under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial
assistance," 20 U. S. C. $ 1681(a). The Federal District Court granted
Lago Vista summary judgment. In affirming, the Fifth Circuit held
that school districts are not liable under Title IX for teacher-student
sexual harassment unless an employee with supervisory power over the
offending employee actually knew of the abuse, had the power to end
it, and failed to do so, and ruled that petitioners could not satisfy that
standard.

Held: Damages may not be recovered for teacher-student sexual harassment in an implied private action under Title IX unless a school district
official who at a minimum has authority to institute corrective measures
on the district's behalf has actual notice of, and is deliberately indifferent to, the teacher's misconduct. Pp. 280-293.

(a) The express statutory means of enforcing Title IX is administrative, as the statute directs federal agencies who distribute education
funding to establish requirements in furtherance of the nondiscrimination mandate and allows agencies to enforce those requirements, including ultimately by suspending or terminating federal funding. The
Court held in Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U. S. 677, that
Title IX is also enforceable through an implied private right of action.
In Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools, 503 U. S. 60, the Court
established that monetary damages are available in such an action,
but made no effort to delimit the circumstances in which that remedy

Syllabus
should lie. Petitioners, relying on standards developed in the context
of Title VII, contend that damages are available in an implied action
under Title IX based on principles of respondeat superior and constructive notice, i. e., without actual notice to officials of discrimination in
school programs. Whether an educational institution can be said to violate Title IX based on principles of respondeat superior and constructive notice has not been resolved by the Court's decisions. In this case,
moreover, petitioners seek damages based on theories of respondeat
superior and constructive notice. Unlike Title IX, Title VII contains
an express cause of action for a damages remedy. Title IX's private
action is judicially implied, however, and so contains no legislative expression of the scope of available remedies. Pp. 280-284.

(b) Because the private right of action is judicially implied, this Court
must infer how Congress would have addressed the issue of monetary
damages had the action been expressly included in Title IX. It does
not appear that Congress contemplated unlimited damages against a
funding recipient that is unaware of discrimination in its programs.
When Title IX was enacted, the principal civil rights statutes containing
an express right of action did not allow monetary damages, and when
Title VII was amended to allow such damages, Congress limited the
amount recoverable in any individual case. Title IX was modeled after
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits race discrimination in programs receiving federal funds. Both statutes condition
federal funding on a recipient's promise not to discriminate, in what
amounts essentially to a contract between the Government and the
recipient. In contrast, Title VII is framed as an outright prohibition.
Title IX's contractual nature has implications for the construction of
the scope of available remedies. When Congress conditions the award
of federal funds under its spending power, the Court closely examines
the propriety of private actions holding recipients liable in damages
for violating the condition. It is sensible to assume that Congress did
not envision a recipient's liability in damages where the recipient was
unaware of the discrimination.

Title IX contains important clues that this was Congress' intent.
Title IX's express means of enforcement requires actual notice to officials of the funding recipient and an opportunity for voluntary compliance before administrative enforcement proceedings can commence.
The presumable purpose is to avoid diverting education funding from
beneficial uses where a recipient who is unaware of discrimination in
its programs is willing to institute prompt corrective measures. Allowing recovery of damages based on principles of respondeat superior
or constructive notice in cases of teacher-student sexual harassment
would be at odds with that basic objective, as liability would attach

Syllabus
even though the district had no actual knowledge of the teacher's conduct and no opportunity to take action to end the harassment. It would
be unsound for a statute's express enforcement system to require notice and an opportunity to comply while a judicially implied system
permits substantial liability--including potentially an award exceeding a recipient's federal funding level--without regard to either requirement. Pp. 284-290.

(c) Absent further direction from Congress, the implied damages
remedy should be fashioned along the same lines as the express remedial scheme. Thus, a damages remedy will not lie unless an official who
at a minimum has authority to address the alleged discrimination and
to institute corrective measures on the recipient's behalf has actual
knowledge of discrimination and fails adequately to respond. Moreover, the response must amount to deliberate indifference to discrimination, in line with the premise of the statute's administrative enforcement scheme of an official decision by the recipient not to remedy the
violation. Applying the framework to this case is fairly straightforward, as petitioners do not contend they can prevail under an actual
notice standard. Lago Vista's alleged failure to comply with federal
regulations requiring it to promulgate and publicize an effective policy
and grievance procedure for sexual harassment claims does not establish
the requisite actual notice and deliberate indifference, and the failure
to promulgate a grievance procedure does not itself constitute discrimination in violation of Title IX. Pp. 290-292.

Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court.
The question in this case is when a school district may beheld liable in damages in an implied right of action under

Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 86 Stat. 373,as amended, 20 U. S. C. $ 1681 et seq. (Title IX), for the sexual
harassment of a student by one of the district's teachers.We conclude that damages may not be recovered in those
circumstances unless an official of the school district who ata minimum has authority to institute corrective measures on
the district's behalf has actual notice of, and is deliberatelyindifferent to, the teacher's misconduct.

I
In the spring of 1991, when petitioner Alida Star Gebserwas an eighth-grade student at a middle school in respondent

Lago Vista Independent School District (Lago Vista), shejoined a high school book discussion group led by Frank Waldrop, a teacher at Lago Vista's high school. Lago Vista re-ceived federal funds at all pertinent times. During the book
discussion sessions, Waldrop often made sexually suggestivecomments to the students. Gebser entered high school in
the fall and was assigned to classes taught by Waldrop inboth semesters. Waldrop continued to make inappropriate

Opinion of the Court
remarks to the students, and he began to direct more of hissuggestive comments toward Gebser, including during the

substantial amount of time that the two were alone in hisclassroom. He initiated sexual contact with Gebser in the
spring, when, while visiting her home ostensibly to give her
a book, he kissed and fondled her. The two had sexual in-tercourse on a number of occasions during the remainder

of the school year. Their relationship continued through thesummer and into the following school year, and they often
had intercourse during class time, although never on schoolproperty.

Gebser did not report the relationship to school officials,
testifying that while she realized Waldrop's conduct was
improper, she was uncertain how to react and she wanted
to continue having him as a teacher. In October 1992, the
parents of two other students complained to the high school
principal about Waldrop's comments in class. The principal
arranged a meeting, at which, according to the principal,
Waldrop indicated that he did not believe he had made offensive remarks but apologized to the parents and said it would
not happen again. The principal also advised Waldrop to be
careful about his classroom comments and told the school
guidance counselor about the meeting, but he did not report
the parents' complaint to Lago Vista's superintendent, who
was the district's Title IX coordinator. A couple of months
later, in January 1993, a police officer discovered Waldrop
and Gebser engaging in sexual intercourse and arrested Waldrop. Lago Vista terminated his employment, and subsequently, the Texas Education Agency revoked his teaching
license. During this time, the district had not promulgated
or distributed an official grievance procedure for lodging sexual harassment complaints; nor had it issued a formal antiharassment policy.

Gebser and her mother filed suit against Lago Vista and
Waldrop in state court in November 1993, raising claims
against the school district under Title IX, Rev. Stat. $ 1979,

Opinion of the Court
42 U. S. C. $ 1983, and state negligence law, and claimsagainst Waldrop primarily under state law. They sought

compensatory and punitive damages from both defendants.After the case was removed, the United States District
Court for the Western District of Texas granted summary
judgment in favor of Lago Vista on all claims, and remandedthe allegations against Waldrop to state court. In rejecting

the Title IX claim against the school district, the court rea-soned that the statute "was enacted to counter

policies of
discrimination . . . in federally funded education programs,"and that "[o]nly if school administrators have some type of

notice of the gender discrimination and fail to respond in
good faith can the discrimination be interpreted as a policy
of the school district." App. to Pet. for Cert. 6a-7a. Here,
the court determined, the parents' complaint to the principal
concerning Waldrop's comments in class was the only one
Lago Vista had received about Waldrop, and that evidence
was inadequate to raise a genuine issue on whether the
school district had actual or constructive notice that Waldrop
was involved in a sexual relationship with a student.

Petitioners appealed only on the Title IX claim. The
Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed, Doe v. Lago
Vista Independent School Dist., 106 F. 3d 1223 (1997), relying in large part on two of its recent decisions, Rosa H. v.
San Elizario Independent School Dist., 106 F. 3d 648 (1997),
and Canutillo Independent School Dist. v. Leija, 101 F. 3d
393 (1996), cert. denied, 520 U. S. 1265 (1997). The court
first declined to impose strict liability on school districts for
a teacher's sexual harassment of a student, reiterating its
conclusion in Leija that strict liability is inconsistent with
"the Title IX contract." 106 F. 3d, at 1225 (internal quotation marks omitted). The court then determined that Lago
Vista could not be liable on the basis of constructive notice,
finding that there was insufficient evidence to suggest that a
school official should have known about Waldrop's relationship with Gebser. Ibid. Finally, the court refused to in524US2 Unit: $U87 [09-15-00 14:31:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
voke the common law principle that holds an employer vicar-iously liable when an employee is "aided in accomplishing [a]

tort by the existence of the agency relation," Restatement(Second) of Agency $ 219(2)(d) (1957) (hereinafter Restatement), explaining that application of that principle wouldresult in school district liability in essentially every case of
teacher-student harassment. 106 F. 3d, at 1225-1226.The court concluded its analysis by reaffirming its holding
in Rosa H. that "school districts are not liable in tort forteacher-student [sexual] harassment under Title IX unless
an employee who has been invested by the school boardwith supervisory power over the offending employee actually knew of the abuse, had the power to end the abuse, andfailed to do so," 106 F. 3d, at 1226, and ruling that petitioners
could not satisfy that standard. The Fifth Circuit's analysisrepresents one of the varying approaches adopted by the
Courts of Appeals in assessing a school district's liabilityunder Title IX for a teacher's sexual harassment of a student. See Smith v. Metropolitan School Dist. Perry Twp.,128 F. 3d 1014 (CA7 1997);

Kracunas v. Iona College, 119F. 3d 80 (CA2 1997); Doe v. Claiborne County, 103 F. 3d 495,

513-515 (CA6 1996); Kinman v. Omaha Public School Dist.,94 F. 3d 463, 469 (CA8 1996). We granted certiorari to address the issue, 522 U. S. 1011 (1997), and we now affirm.

Title IX provides in pertinent part: "No person . . . shall,on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be

denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discriminationunder any education program or activity receiving Federal
financial assistance." 20 U. S. C. $ 1681(a). The expressstatutory means of enforcement is administrative: The statute directs federal agencies that distribute education fundingto establish requirements to effectuate the nondiscrimination
mandate, and permits the agencies to enforce those require-ments through "any . . . means authorized by law," including

Opinion of the Court
ultimately the termination of federal funding. $ 1682. TheCourt held in

Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U. S. 677
(1979), that Title IX is also enforceable through an impliedprivate right of action, a conclusion we do not revisit

here. We subsequently established in Franklin v. Gwinnett
County Public Schools, 503 U. S. 60 (1992), that monetarydamages are available in the implied private action.

In Franklin, a high school student alleged that a teacherhad sexually abused her on repeated occasions and that
teachers and school administrators knew about the har-assment but took no action, even to the point of dissuading
her from initiating charges. See id., at 63-64. The lower
courts dismissed Franklin's complaint against the school district on the ground that the implied right of action under
Title IX, as a categorical matter, does not encompass recovery in damages. We reversed the lower courts' blanket rule,
concluding that Title IX supports a private action for damages, at least "in a case such as this, in which intentional
discrimination is alleged." See id., at 74-75. Franklin
thereby establishes that a school district can be held liable
in damages in cases involving a teacher's sexual harassment
of a student; the decision, however, does not purport to define the contours of that liability.

We face that issue squarely in this case. Petitioners,
joined by the United States as amicus curiae, would invoke
standards used by the Courts of Appeals in Title VII cases
involving a supervisor's sexual harassment of an employee
in the workplace. In support of that approach, they point to
a passage in Franklin in which we stated: "Unquestionably,
Title IX placed on the Gwinnett County Public Schools the
duty not to discriminate on the basis of sex, and `when a
supervisor sexually harasses a subordinate because of the
subordinate's sex, that supervisor "discriminate[s]" on the
basis of sex.' Meritor Sav. Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477 U. S.
57, 64 (1986). We believe the same rule should apply when a
teacher sexually harasses and abuses a student." Id., at 75.

282 GEBSER v. LAGO VISTA INDEPENDENT SCHOOL DIST.

Opinion of the Court
Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477 U. S. 57 (1986),
directs courts to look to common law agency principles when
assessing an employer's liability under Title VII for sexual
harassment of an employee by a supervisor. See id., at 72.
Petitioners and the United States submit that, in light of
Franklin's comparison of teacher-student harassment with
supervisor-employee harassment, agency principles should
likewise apply in Title IX actions.

Specifically, they advance two possible standards under
which Lago Vista would be liable for Waldrop's conduct.
First, relying on a 1997 "Policy Guidance" issued by the Department of Education, they would hold a school district
liable in damages under Title IX where a teacher is " `aided
in carrying out the sexual harassment of students by his or
her position of authority with the institution,' " irrespective
of whether school district officials had any knowledge of the
harassment and irrespective of their response upon becoming
aware. Brief for Petitioners 36 (quoting Dept. of Education,
Office for Civil Rights, Sexual Harassment Policy Guidance:
Harrassment of Students by School Employees, Other Students, or Third Parties, 62 Fed. Reg. 12034, 12039 (1997)
(1997 Policy Guidance)); Brief for United States as Amicus
Curiae 14. That rule is an expression of respondeat superior liability, i. e., vicarious or imputed liability, see Restatement $ 219(2)(d), under which recovery in damages against a
school district would generally follow whenever a teacher's
authority over a student facilitates the harassment. Second, petitioners and the United States submit that a school
district should at a minimum be liable for damages based on
a theory of constructive notice, i. e., where the district knew
or "should have known" about harassment but failed to uncover and eliminate it. Brief for Petitioners 28; Brief for
United States as Amicus Curiae 15-16; see Restatement

$ 219(2)(b). Both standards would allow a damages recovery
in a broader range of situations than the rule adopted by the

524US2 Unit: $U87 [09-15-00 14:31:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN

283Cite as: 524 U. S. 274 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
Court of Appeals, which hinges on actual knowledge by aschool official with authority to end the harassment.

Whether educational institutions can be said to violateTitle IX based solely on principles of

respondeat superior or
constructive notice was not resolved by Franklin's citation
of Meritor. That reference to Meritor was made with re-gard to the general proposition that sexual harassment can

constitute discrimination on the basis of sex under Title IX,see

Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc., 523 U. S.
75, 80-81 (1998), an issue not in dispute here. In fact, theschool district's liability in

Franklin did not necessarily turn
on principles of imputed liability or constructive notice, as
there was evidence that school officials knew about the
harassment but took no action to stop it. See 503 U. S., at
63-64. Moreover, Meritor's rationale for concluding that
agency principles guide the liability inquiry under Title VII
rests on an aspect of that statute not found in Title IX:
Title VII, in which the prohibition against employment discrimination runs against "an employer," 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-
2(a), explicitly defines "employer" to include "any agent,"

$ 2000e(b). See Meritor, supra, at 72. Title IX contains
no comparable reference to an educational institution's
"agents," and so does not expressly call for application of
agency principles.

In this case, moreover, petitioners seek not just to establish a Title IX violation but to recover damages based on
theories of respondeat superior and constructive notice. It
is that aspect of their action, in our view, that is most critical
to resolving the case. Unlike Title IX, Title VII contains an
express cause of action, $ 2000e-5(f), and specifically provides for relief in the form of monetary damages, $ 1981a.
Congress therefore has directly addressed the subject of
damages relief under Title VII and has set out the particular situations in which damages are available as well as the
maximum amounts recoverable. $ 1981a(b). With respect
to Title IX, however, the private right of action is judicially

524US2 Unit: $U87 [09-15-00 14:31:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN
284 GEBSER v. LAGO VISTA INDEPENDENT SCHOOL DIST.

Opinion of the Court
implied, see Cannon, 441 U. S., at 717, and there is thus nolegislative expression of the scope of available remedies, including when it is appropriate to award monetary damages.In addition, although the general presumption that courts
can award any appropriate relief in an established cause ofaction,

e. g., Bell v. Hood, 327 U. S. 678, 684 (1946), coupledwith Congress' abrogation of the States' Eleventh Amendment immunity under Title IX, see 42 U. S. C. $ 2000d-7, ledus to conclude in Franklin that Title IX recognizes a damages remedy, 503 U. S., at 68-73; see id., at 78 (Scalia, J.,concurring in judgment), we did so in response to lower
court decisions holding that Title IX does not support dam-ages relief at all. We made no effort in

Franklin to delimitthe circumstances in which a damages remedy should lie.

III
Because the private right of action under Title IX isjudicially implied, we have a measure of latitude to shape a

sensible remedial scheme that best comports with the stat-ute. See, e. g., Musick, Peeler & Garrett v. Employers Ins.
of Wausau, 508 U. S. 286, 292-293 (1993); Virginia Bank-shares, Inc. v. Sandberg, 501 U. S. 1083, 1104 (1991). That
endeavor inherently entails a degree of speculation, sinceit addresses an issue on which Congress has not specifically
spoken. See, e. g., Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind, Prupis & Petigrow v. Gilbertson, 501 U. S. 350, 359 (1991). To guide theanalysis, we generally examine the relevant statute to ensure that we do not fashion the scope of an implied rightin a manner at odds with the statutory structure and purpose. See Musick, Peeler, 508 U. S., at 294-297; id., at 300(

Thomas, J., dissenting); Virginia Bankshares, supra, at1102.

Those considerations, we think, are pertinent not only tothe scope of the implied right, but also to the scope of the
available remedies. See Transamerica Mortgage Advisors,Inc. v. Lewis, 444 U. S. 11 (1979); see also Franklin, supra,

524US2 Unit: $U87 [09-15-00 14:31:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN

285Cite as: 524 U. S. 274 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
at 77-78 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment). We sug-gested as much in

Franklin, where we recognized "the general rule that all appropriate relief is available in an actionbrought to vindicate a federal right," but indicated that the

rule must be reconciled with congressional purpose. 503
U. S., at 68. The "general rule," that is, "yields where nec-essary to carry out the intent of Congress or to avoid frustrating the purposes of the statute involved." Guardians
Assn. v. Civil Serv. Comm'n of New York City, 463 U. S. 582,
595 (1983) (opinion of White, J.); cf., Cannon, 441 U. S, at 703("[A] private remedy should not be implied if it would frustrate the underlying purpose of the legislative scheme").

Applying those principles here, we conclude that it would
"frustrate the purposes" of Title IX to permit a damages
recovery against a school district for a teacher's sexual harassment of a student based on principles of respondeat superior or constructive notice, i. e., without actual notice to a
school district official. Because Congress did not expressly
create a private right of action under Title IX, the statutory
text does not shed light on Congress' intent with respect to
the scope of available remedies. Franklin, 503 U. S., at 71;
id., at 76 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment). Instead, "we
attempt to infer how the [1972] Congress would have addressed the issue had the . . . action been included as an
express provision in the" statute. Central Bank of Denver,
N. A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A., 511 U. S. 164,
178 (1994) (internal quotation marks omitted); see Musick,
Peeler, supra, at 294-295; North Haven Bd. of Ed. v. Bell,
456 U. S. 512, 529 (1982).

As a general matter, it does not appear that Congress contemplated unlimited recovery in damages against a funding
recipient where the recipient is unaware of discrimination in
its programs. When Title IX was enacted in 1972, the principal civil rights statutes containing an express right of action did not provide for recovery of monetary damages at all,
instead allowing only injunctive and equitable relief. See 42

Opinion of the Court
U. S. C. $ 2000a-3(a) (1970 ed.); $$ 2000e-5(e), (g) (1970 ed.,Supp. II). It was not until 1991 that Congress made damages available under Title VII, and even then, Congress care-fully limited the amount recoverable in any individual case,
calibrating the maximum recovery to the size of the employer. See 42 U. S. C. $ 1981a(b)(3). Adopting petitioners'position would amount, then, to allowing unlimited recovery

of damages under Title IX where Congress has not spokenon the subject of either the right or the remedy, and in the
face of evidence that when Congress expressly consideredboth in Title VII it restricted the amount of damages
available.

Congress enacted Title IX in 1972 with two principal objectives in mind: "[T]o avoid the use of federal resources to
support discriminatory practices" and "to provide individual
citizens effective protection against those practices." Cannon, supra, at 704. The statute was modeled after Title VI
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, see 441 U. S., at 694-696;
Grove City College v. Bell, 465 U. S. 555, 566 (1984), which
is parallel to Title IX except that it prohibits race discrimination, not sex discrimination, and applies in all programs
receiving federal funds, not only in education programs.
See 42 U. S. C. $ 2000d et seq. The two statutes operate in
the same manner, conditioning an offer of federal funding on
a promise by the recipient not to discriminate, in what
amounts essentially to a contract between the Government
and the recipient of funds. See Guardians, 463 U. S., at 599
(opinion of White, J.); id., at 609 (Powell, J., concurring in
judgment); cf. Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U. S. 1, 17 (1981).

That contractual framework distinguishes Title IX from
Title VII, which is framed in terms not of a condition but of
an outright prohibition. Title VII applies to all employers
without regard to federal funding and aims broadly to "eradicat[e] discrimination throughout the economy." Landgraf
v. USI Film Products, 511 U. S. 244, 254 (1994) (internal quo524US2 Unit: $U87 [09-15-00 14:31:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
tation marks omitted). Title VII, moreover, seeks to "makepersons whole for injuries suffered through past discrimination." Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus,whereas Title VII aims centrally to compensate victims of
discrimination, Title IX focuses more on "protecting" individuals from discriminatory practices carried out by re-cipients of federal funds.

Cannon, supra, at 704. That
might explain why, when the Court first recognized the im-plied right under Title IX in

Cannon, the opinion referred
to injunctive or equitable relief in a private action, see 441U. S., at 705, and n. 38, 710, n. 44, 711, but not to a damages

remedy.

Title IX's contractual nature has implications for our
construction of the scope of available remedies. When
Congress attaches conditions to the award of federal funds
under its spending power, U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 8, cl. 1, as
it has in Title IX and Title VI, we examine closely the
propriety of private actions holding the recipient liable in
monetary damages for noncompliance with the condition.
See Franklin, supra, at 74-75; Guardians, supra, at 596-

603 (White, J.); see generally Pennhurst, supra, at 28-29.
Our central concern in that regard is with ensuring that "the
receiving entity of federal funds [has] notice that it will be
liable for a monetary award." Franklin, supra, at 74. Justice White's opinion announcing the Court's judgment in
Guardians Assn. v. Civil Serv. Comm'n of New York City,
for instance, concluded that the relief in an action under Title
VI alleging unintentional discrimination should be prospective only, because where discrimination is unintentional, "it
is surely not obvious that the grantee was aware that it was
administering the program in violation of the [condition]."
463 U. S., at 598. We confront similar concerns here. If a
school district's liability for a teacher's sexual harassment
rests on principles of constructive notice or respondeat superior, it will likewise be the case that the recipient of funds
was unaware of the discrimination. It is sensible to as524US2 Unit: $U87 [09-15-00 14:31:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN
288 GEBSER v. LAGO VISTA INDEPENDENT SCHOOL DIST.

Opinion of the Court
sume that Congress did not envision a recipient's liability indamages in that situation. See

Rosa H., 106 F. 3d, at 654
("When the school board accepted federal funds, it agreednot to discriminate on the basis of sex. We think it unlikely

that it further agreed to suffer liability whenever its employees discriminate on the basis of sex").Most significantly, Title IX contains important clues that

Congress did not intend to allow recovery in damages whereliability rests solely on principles of vicarious liability or
constructive notice. Title IX's express means of enforce-ment--by administrative agencies--operates on an assumption of actual notice to officials of the funding recipient. The
statute entitles agencies who disburse education funding
to enforce their rules implementing the nondiscrimination
mandate through proceedings to suspend or terminate funding or through "other means authorized by law." 20 U. S. C.

$ 1682. Significantly, however, an agency may not initiate
enforcement proceedings until it "has advised the appropriate person or persons of the failure to comply with the
requirement and has determined that compliance cannot
be secured by voluntary means." Ibid. The administrative
regulations implement that obligation, requiring resolution
of compliance issues "by informal means whenever possible,"
34 CFR $ 100.7(d) (1997), and prohibiting commencement of
enforcement proceedings until the agency has determined
that voluntary compliance is unobtainable and "the recipient . . . has been notified of its failure to comply and of

the action to be taken to effect compliance," $ 100.8(d); see

$ 100.8(c).

In the event of a violation, a funding recipient may be
required to take "such remedial action as [is] deem[ed]
necessary to overcome the effects of [the] discrimination."

$ 106.3. While agencies have conditioned continued funding
on providing equitable relief to the victim, see, e. g., North
Haven, 456 U. S., at 518 (reinstatement of employee), the
regulations do not appear to contemplate a condition order524US2 Unit: $U87 [09-15-00 14:31:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
ing payment of monetary damages, and there is no indicationthat payment of damages has been demanded as a condition

of finding a recipient to be in compliance with the statute.See Brief for United States as

Amicus Curiae in Franklin
v. Gwinnett County School District, O. T. 1991, No. 90-918,
p. 24. In Franklin, for instance, the Department of Educa-tion found a violation of Title IX but determined that the

school district came into compliance by virtue of the offend-ing teacher's resignation and the district's institution of a
grievance procedure for sexual harassment complaints. 503U. S., at 64, n. 3.

Presumably, a central purpose of requiring notice of the
violation "to the appropriate person" and an opportunity for
voluntary compliance before administrative enforcement
proceedings can commence is to avoid diverting education
funding from beneficial uses where a recipient was unaware
of discrimination in its programs and is willing to institute
prompt corrective measures. The scope of private damages
relief proposed by petitioners is at odds with that basic
objective. When a teacher's sexual harassment is imputed
to a school district or when a school district is deemed to
have "constructively" known of the teacher's harassment,
by assumption the district had no actual knowledge of the
teacher's conduct. Nor, of course, did the district have an
opportunity to take action to end the harassment or to limit
further harassment.

It would be unsound, we think, for a statute's express system of enforcement to require notice to the recipient and
an opportunity to come into voluntary compliance while a
judicially implied system of enforcement permits substantial
liability without regard to the recipient's knowledge or its
corrective actions upon receiving notice. Cf. Central Bank
of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A.,
511 U. S., at 180 ("[I]t would be `anomalous to impute to Congress an intention to expand the plaintiff class for a judicially
implied cause of action beyond the bounds it delineated for

Opinion of the Court
comparable express causes of action' "), quoting Blue ChipStamps v. Manor Drug Stores, 421 U. S. 723, 736 (1975).

Moreover, an award of damages in a particular case mightwell exceed a recipient's level of federal funding. See Tr. of
Oral Arg. 35 (Lago Vista's federal funding for 1992-1993 wasroughly $120,000). Where a statute's express enforcement
scheme hinges its most severe sanction on notice and un-successful efforts to obtain compliance, we cannot attribute
to Congress the intention to have implied an enforcementscheme that allows imposition of greater liability without
comparable conditions. IV

Because the express remedial scheme under Title IX ispredicated upon notice to an "appropriate person" and an
opportunity to rectify any violation, 20 U. S. C. $ 1682, weconclude, in the absence of further direction from Congress,
that the implied damages remedy should be fashioned alongthe same lines. An "appropriate person" under $ 1682 is, at
a minimum, an official of the recipient entity with authorityto take corrective action to end the discrimination. Consequently, in cases like this one that do not involve official pol-icy of the recipient entity, we hold that a damages remedy
will not lie under Title IX unless an official who at a mini-mum has authority to address the alleged discrimination and
to institute corrective measures on the recipient's behalf hasactual knowledge of discrimination in the recipient's programs and fails adequately to respond.We think, moreover, that the response must amount to deliberate indifference to discrimination. The administrativeenforcement scheme presupposes that an official who is advised of a Title IX violation refuses to take action to bringthe recipient into compliance. The premise, in other words,
is an official decision by the recipient not to remedy the viola-tion. That framework finds a rough parallel in the standard
of deliberate indifference. Under a lower standard, therewould be a risk that the recipient would be liable in dam524US2 Unit: $U87 [09-15-00 14:31:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN

291Cite as: 524 U. S. 274 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
ages not for its own official decision but instead for its em-ployees' independent actions. Comparable considerations

led to our adoption of a deliberate indifference standardfor claims under $ 1983 alleging that a municipality's actions
in failing to prevent a deprivation of federal rights was the
cause of the violation. See Board of Comm'rs of Bryan Cty.v.

Brown, 520 U. S. 397 (1997); Canton v. Harris, 489 U. S.
378, 388-392 (1989); see also Collins v. Harker Heights, 503U. S. 115, 123-124 (1992).

Applying the framework to this case is fairly straight-forward, as petitioners do not contend they can prevail under
an actual notice standard. The only official alleged to have
had information about Waldrop's misconduct is the high
school principal. That information, however, consisted of a
complaint from parents of other students charging only that
Waldrop had made inappropriate comments during class,
which was plainly insufficient to alert the principal to the
possibility that Waldrop was involved in a sexual relationship with a student. Lago Vista, moreover, terminated Waldrop's employment upon learning of his relationship with
Gebser. Justice Stevens points out in his dissenting opinion that Waldrop of course had knowledge of his own actions.
See post, at 299, n. 8. Where a school district's liability rests
on actual notice principles, however, the knowledge of the
wrongdoer himself is not pertinent to the analysis. See Restatement $ 280.

Petitioners focus primarily on Lago Vista's asserted failure to promulgate and publicize an effective policy and grievance procedure for sexual harassment claims. They point to
Department of Education regulations requiring each funding
recipient to "adopt and publish grievance procedures providing for prompt and equitable resolution" of discrimination
complaints, 34 CFR $ 106.8(b) (1997), and to notify students
and others that "it does not discriminate on the basis of sex
in the educational programs or activities which it operates,"

$ 106.9(a). Lago Vista's alleged failure to comply with the

292 GEBSER v. LAGO VISTA INDEPENDENT SCHOOL DIST.

Opinion of the Court
regulations, however, does not establish the requisite actualnotice and deliberate indifference. And in any event, the

failure to promulgate a grievance procedure does not itselfconstitute "discrimination" under Title IX. Of course, the
Department of Education could enforce the requirement ad-ministratively: Agencies generally have authority to promulgate and enforce requirements that effectuate the statute'snondiscrimination mandate, 20 U. S. C. $ 1682, even if those
requirements do not purport to represent a definition of dis-crimination under the statute.

E. g., Grove City, 465 U. S.,at 574-575 (permitting administrative enforcement of regulation requiring college to execute an "Assurance of Compli-ance" with Title IX). We have never held, however, that
the implied private right of action under Title IX allowsrecovery in damages for violation of those sorts of administrative requirements. V

The number of reported cases involving sexual harassmentof students in schools confirms that harassment unfortunately is an all too common aspect of the educational experi-ence. No one questions that a student suffers extraordinary
harm when subjected to sexual harassment and abuse by ateacher, and that the teacher's conduct is reprehensible and
undermines the basic purposes of the educational system.The issue in this case, however, is whether the independent
misconduct of a teacher is attributable to the school districtthat employs him under a specific federal statute designed
primarily to prevent recipients of federal financial assistancefrom using the funds in a discriminatory manner. Our decision does not affect any right of recovery that an individualmay have against a school district as a matter of state law
or against the teacher in his individual capacity under statelaw or under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983. Until Congress speaks directly on the subject, however, we will not hold a schooldistrict liable in damages under Title IX for a teacher's
sexual harassment of a student absent actual notice and de524US2 Unit: $U87 [09-15-00 14:31:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN

liberate indifference. We therefore affirm the judgment ofthe Court of Appeals.

It is so ordered.
Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Souter, Justice
Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer join, dissenting.

The question that the petition for certiorari asks us to ad-dress is whether the Lago Vista Independent School District

(respondent) is liable in damages for a violation of Title IX ofthe Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U. S. C. $ 1681

et seq.(Title IX). The Court provides us with a negative answer

to that question because respondent did not have actual no-tice of, and was not deliberately indifferent to, the odious
misconduct of one of its teachers. As a basis for its decision,the majority relies heavily on the notion that because the
private cause of action under Title IX is "judicially implied,"the Court has "a measure of latitude" to use its own judgment in shaping a remedial scheme. See ante, at 284. Thisassertion of lawmaking authority is not faithful either to our
precedents or to our duty to interpret, rather than to revise,congressional commands. Moreover, the majority's policy
judgment about the appropriate remedy in this case thwartsthe purposes of Title IX.

It is important to emphasize that in Cannon v. University
of Chicago, 441 U. S. 677 (1979), the Court confronted a ques-tion of statutory construction. The decision represented

our considered judgment about the intent of the Congressthat enacted Title IX in 1972. After noting that Title IX
had been patterned after Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of1964, which had been interpreted to include a private right
of action, we concluded that Congress intended to authorizethe same private enforcement of Title IX. 441 U. S., at 694-
698; see also id., at 703 ("We have no doubt that Congressintended to create Title IX remedies comparable to those
available under Title VI and that it understood Title VI as

authorizing an implied private cause of action for victims of
the prohibited discrimination").1 As long as the intent of
Congress is clear, an implicit command has the same legal
force as one that is explicit. The fact that a statute does not
authorize a particular remedy "in so many words is no more
significant than the fact that it does not in terms authorize
execution to issue on a judgment recovered under [the statute]." Deckert v. Independence Shares Corp., 311 U. S. 282,
288 (1940).2

In Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools, 503 U. S.
60 (1992), we unanimously concluded that Title IX authorized

1 We explained: "In 1972 when Title IX was enacted, the critical language in Title VI had already been construed as creating a private
remedy . . . . It is always appropriate to assume that our elected representatives, like other citizens, know the law; in this case, because of their
repeated references to Title VI and its modes of enforcement, we are especially justified in presuming both that those representatives were aware
of the prior interpretation of Title VI and that that interpretation reflects
their intent with respect to Title IX." 441 U. S., at 696-698. We also
observed that "during the period between the enactment of Title VI in
1964 and the enactment of Title IX in 1972, this Court had consistently
found implied remedies--often in cases much less clear than this. It was
after 1972 that this Court decided Cort v. Ash[, 422 U. S. 66 (1975),] and
the other cases cited by the Court of Appeals in support of its strict construction of the remedial aspect of the statute. We, of course, adhere to
the strict approach followed in our recent cases, but our evaluation of
congressional action in 1972 must take into account its contemporary legal
contest. In sum, it is not only appropriate but also realistic to presume
that Congress was thoroughly familiar with these unusually important
precedents from this and other federal courts and that it expected its
enactment to be interpreted in conformity with them." Id., at 698-699
(footnotes omitted).

2 In Consolidated Rail Corporation v. Darrone, 465 U. S. 624 (1984),

we unanimously concluded that comparable language in the statute prohibiting discrimination against the handicapped by federal grant recipients
authorized a private right of action for the recovery of backpay. That
decision, like Cannon, relied on the fact that the comparable language in
Title VI had authorized a private remedy. See 465 U. S., at 626, 635.

on the presumption that Congress intends to authorize "allappropriate remedies" unless it expressly indicates otherwise. Id., at 66.3 He then noted that two amendments 4to Title IX enacted after the decision in

Cannon had vali-dated Cannon's holding and supported the conclusion that

Justice

Cannon's holding,' ante,at 72, but also as an implicit acknowledgment that damages

are available." 503 U. S., at 78.

deserve this high appellation, if the laws furnish no remedy for the violation of a vested legal right.' This principle originated in the English common law, and Blackstone described it as `a general and indisputable rule,

Stevens, J., dissenting
Because these constructions of the statute have been ac-cepted by Congress and are unchallenged here, they have

the same legal effect as if the private cause of action seekingdamages had been explicitly, rather than implicitly, authorized by Congress. We should therefore seek guidance fromthe text of the statute and settled legal principles rather
than from our views about sound policy.

II
We have already noted that the text of Title IX shouldbe accorded " `a sweep as broad as its language.' " North

Haven Bd. of Ed. v. Bell, 456 U. S. 512, 521 (1982) (quotingUnited States v. Price, 383 U. S. 787 (1966)). That sweep is
broad indeed. "No person . . . shall, on the basis of sex, . . .be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance . . . ."20 U. S. C. $ 1681(a). As Judge Rovner has correctly observed, the use of passive verbs in Title IX, focusing onthe victim of the discrimination rather than the particular wrongdoer, gives this statute broader coverage thanTitle VII. See

Smith v. Metropolitan School Dist. PerryTwp., 128 F. 3d 1014, 1047 (CA7 1997) (dissenting opinion).

5 "Unlike Title VII . . . , which focuses on the discriminator, making it
unlawful for an employer to engage in certain prohibited practices (see 42
U. S. C. $ 2000e-2(a)), Title IX is drafted from the perspective of the person discriminated against. That statute names no actor, but using passive
verbs, focuses on the setting in which the discrimination occurred. In
effect, the statute asks but a single question--whether an individual was
subjected to discrimination under a covered program or activity. . . . And
because Title IX as drafted includes no actor at all, it necessarily follows
that the statute also would not reference `agents' of that non-existent
actor." Smith v. Metropolitan School Dist. Perry Twp., 128 F. 3d, at

Moreover, because respondent assumed the statutory dutyset out in Title IX as part of its consideration for the receipt

of federal funds, that duty constitutes an affirmative under-taking that is more significant than a mere promise to obey
the law.Both of these considerations are reflected in our decision
in Franklin. Explaining why Title IX is violated when ateacher sexually abuses a student, we wrote:

"Unquestionably, Title IX placed on the GwinnettCounty Public Schools the duty not to discriminate on
the basis of sex, and `when a supervisor sexually har-asses a subordinate because of the subordinate's sex,
that supervisor "discriminate[s]" on the basis of sex.'
Meritor Sav. Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477 U. S. 57, 64(1986). We believe the same rule should apply when a

teacher sexually harasses and abuses a student. Congress surely did not intend for federal moneys to be ex-pended to support the intentional actions it sought by

statute to proscribe." 503 U. S., at 75 (emphasis added).
Franklin therefore stands for the proposition that sexualharassment of a student by a teacher violates the duty--

assumed by the school district in exchange for federalfunds--not to discriminate on the basis of sex, and that a
student may recover damages from a school district for sucha violation.

Although the opinion the Court announces today is not en-tirely clear, it does not purport to overrule Franklin. See
ante, at 281 ("Franklin thereby establishes that a school dis-trict can be held liable in damages in cases involving a teacher's sexual harassment of a student"). Moreover, I do notunderstand the Court to question the conclusion that an intentional violation of Title IX, of the type we recognized in

Stevens, J., dissenting
Franklin,6 has been alleged in this case.7 During her freshman and sophomore years of high school, petitioner Alida
Star Gebser was repeatedly subjected to sexual abuse by her
teacher, Frank Waldrop, whom she had met in the eighth
grade when she joined his high school book discussion group.
Waldrop's conduct was surely intentional, and it occurred
during, and as a part of, a curriculum activity in which he
wielded authority over Gebser that had been delegated to
him by respondent. Moreover, it is undisputed that the
activity was subsidized, in part, with federal moneys.

The Court nevertheless holds that the law does not provide a damages remedy for the Title IX violation alleged
in this case because no official of the school district with
"authority to institute corrective measures on the district's
behalf " had actual notice of Waldrop's misconduct. Ante,
at 277. That holding is at odds with settled principles of

6 As the Court notes, the student in Franklin--unlike the student in
this case--alleged that school administrators knew about the harassment
but failed to act. See ante, at 281; Franklin v. Gwinnett County Schools,
503 U. S., at 64. The Franklin opinion does not suggest, however, that
that allegation was relevant to its holding that the school district could be
liable in damages for an intentional violation of Title IX as a result of
teacher-student harassment.

7 Cf. Brief for Respondent 9 ("It is important to bear in mind that the

question in this case is not whether school districts are somehow `responsible' for violations of Title IX and for failure to comply with administrative
procedures. The issue is in what circumstances a school district may be
compelled to answer in damages for a violation of Title IX or its implementing regulations"); id., at 13 ("In sum, the manner in which Title IX is
phrased simply determines that a violation of the statute may occur whenever a person is discriminated against on the basis of sex, regardless of
the school district's knowledge of the discrimination. But nothing in the
language of the statute indicates that a school district must respond in
damages for every such violation, regardless of its own knowledge or
culpability"). But see id., at 19 ("[T]here is no evidence that Lago Vista
committed an intentional violation of Title IX").

the tort by the existence of the agency relation." Restate-ment (Second) of Agency $ 219(2)(d) (1957).

9 This case presents a paradigmatic example of a tort that was made pos-sible, that was effected, and that was repeated over a

prolonged period because of the powerful influence that Wal-drop had over Gebser by reason of the authority that his
employer, the school district, had delegated to him. As asecondary school teacher, Waldrop exercised even greater
authority and control over his students than employers andsupervisors exercise over their employees. His gross misuse of that authority allowed him to abuse his young stu-dent's trust.

8 The Court's holding is also questionable as a factual matter. Waldrop
himself surely had ample authority to maintain order in the classes that
he conducted. Indeed, that is a routine part of every teacher's responsibilities. If Gebser had been the victim of sexually harassing conduct by
other students during those classes, surely the teacher would have had
ample authority to take corrective measures. The fact that he did not
prevent his own harassment of Gebser is the consequence of his lack of
will, not his lack of authority.

9 The Court suggests that agency principles are inapplicable to this case

because Title IX does not expressly refer to an "agent," as Title VII does.
See ante, at 283 (citing 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e(b)). Title IX's focus on the
protected class rather than the fund recipient fully explains the statute's
failure to mention "agents" of the recipient, however. See n. 5, supra.
Moreover, in Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477 U. S. 57 (1986),
we viewed Title VII's reference to an "agent" as a limitation on the liability of the employer: "Congress' decision to define `employer' to include any
`agent' of an employer, 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e(b), surely evinces an intent to
place some limits on the acts of employees for which employers under Title
VII are to be held responsible." Id., at 72.

10 For example, Waldrop first sexually abused Gebser when he visited

her house on the pretense of giving her a book that she needed for a school
project. See App. 54a (deposition of Alida Star Gebser). Gebser, then a
high school freshman, stated that she "was terrified": "He was the main
teacher at the school with whom I had discussions, and I didn't know what

Stevens, J., dissenting
Reliance on the principle set out in $ 219(2)(b) of the
Restatement comports with the relevant agency's interpretation of Title IX. The United States Department of Education, through its Office for Civil Rights, recently issued
a policy "Guidance" stating that a school district is liable
under Title IX if one of its teachers "was aided in carrying
out the sexual harassment of students by his or her position
of authority with the institution." Sexual Harassment Policy Guidance: Harassment of Students by School Employees,
Other Students, or Third Parties, 62 Fed. Reg. 12034, 12039
(1997). As the agency charged with administering and enforcing Title IX, see 20 U. S. C. $ 1682, the Department of
Education has a special interest in ensuring that federal
funds are not used in contravention of Title IX's mandate.
It is therefore significant that the Department's interpretation of the statute wholly supports the conclusion that
respondent is liable in damages for Waldrop's sexual abuse
of his student, which was made possible only by Waldrop's
affirmative misuse of his authority as her teacher.

The reason why the common law imposes liability on the
principal in such circumstances is the same as the reason
why Congress included the prohibition against discrimination on the basis of sex in Title IX: to induce school boards
to adopt and enforce practices that will minimize the danger
that vulnerable students will be exposed to such odious
behavior. The rule that the Court has crafted creates the
opposite incentive. As long as school boards can insulate
themselves from knowledge about this sort of conduct, they

to do." Id., at 56a. Gebser was the only student to attend Waldrop's
summer advanced placement course, and the two often had sexual intercourse during the time allotted for the class. See id., at 60a. Gebser
stated that she declined to report the sexual relationship because "if I was
to blow the whistle on that, then I wouldn't be able to have this person as
a teacher anymore." Id., at 62a. She also stated that Waldrop "was the
person in Lago administration . . . who I most trusted, and he was the one
that I would have been making the complaint against." Id., at 63a.

can claim immunity from damages liability.11 Indeed, therule that the Court adopts would preclude a damages remedy even if every teacher at the school knew about the har-assment but did not have "authority to institute corrective
measures on the district's behalf." Ante, at 277. It is notmy function to determine whether this newly fashioned rule
is wiser than the established common-law rule. It is proper,however, to suggest that the Court bears the burden of justifying its rather dramatic departure from settled law, and toexplain why its opinion fails to shoulder that burden.

III
The Court advances several reasons why it would "frus-trate the purposes" of Title IX to allow recovery against a

school district that does not have actual notice of a teacher'ssexual harassment of a student. Ante, at 285 (internal quotation marks omitted). As the Court acknowledges, how-ever, the two principal purposes that motivated the enactment of Title IX were: (1) " `to avoid the use of federalresources to support discriminatory practices' "; and (2) " `to
provide individual citizens effective protection against thosepractices.' "

Ante, at 286 (quoting Cannon, 441 U. S., at704). It seems quite obvious that both of those purposes

would be served--not frustrated--by providing a damagesremedy in a case of this kind. To the extent that the Court's
reasons for its policy choice have any merit, they suggestthat no damages should ever be awarded in a Title IX case--
in other words, that our unanimous holding in Franklinshould be repudiated.

11 The Court concludes that its holding "does not affect any right of recovery that an individual may have against a school district as a matter
of state law or against the teacher in his individual capacity under state
law or under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983." Ante, at 292. In this case, of course,
the District Court denied petitioners' $ 1983 claim on summary judgment,
and it is undisputed that the Texas Tort Claims Act, Tex. Civ. Prac. &
Rem. Code Ann. $ 101.051 (1997), immunizes school districts from tort liability in cases like this one.

302 GEBSER v. LAGO VISTA INDEPENDENT SCHOOL DIST.

Stevens, J., dissenting
First, the Court observes that at the time Title IX wasenacted, "the principal civil rights statutes containing an

express right of action did not provide for recovery of mon-etary damages at all." Ante, at 285. Franklin, however,
forecloses this reevaluation of legislative intent; in that case,we "evaluate[d] the state of the law when the Legislature
passed Title IX," 503 U. S., at 71, and concluded that "thesame contextual approach used to justify an implied right of
action more than amply demonstrates the lack of any legisla-tive intent to abandon the traditional presumption in favor
of all available remedies," id., at 72. The Court also sug-gests that the fact that Congress has imposed a ceiling on
the amount of damages that may be recovered in Title VIIcases, see 42 U. S. C. $ 1981a, is somehow relevant to the
question whether any damages at all may be awarded in aTitle IX case. Ante, at 286. The short answer to this creative argument is that the Title VII ceiling does not haveany bearing on when damages may be recovered from a
defendant in a Title IX case. Moreover, this case does notpresent any issue concerning the amount of any possible
damages award.12Second, the Court suggests that the school district did
not have fair notice when it accepted federal funding thatit might be held liable " `for a monetary award' " under
Title IX. Ante, at 287 (quoting Franklin, 503 U. S., at 74).The Court cannot mean, however, that respondent was not

12 The lower courts are not powerless to control the size of damages
verdicts. See n. 18, infra. Courts retain the power to order a remittitur,
for example. In addition, the size of a jury verdict presumably would
depend on several factors, at least some of which a school district could
control. For example, one important factor might be whether the district
had adopted and disseminated an effective policy on sexual harassment.

on notice that sexual harassment of a student by a teacherconstitutes an "intentional" violation of Title IX for which

damages are available, because we so held shortly beforeWaldrop began abusing Gebser. See

id., at 74-75. Given
the fact that our holding in Franklin was unanimous, it is
not unreasonable to assume that it could have been foreseenby counsel for the recipients of Title IX funds. Moreover,

the nondiscrimination requirement set out in Title IX isclear, and this Court held that sexual harassment constitutes
intentional sex discrimination long before the sexual abusein this case began. See

Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477 U. S. 57, 64 (1986). Normally, of course, we presume that the citizen has knowledge of the law.

The majority nevertheless takes the position that a school
district that accepts federal funds under Title IX should not
be held liable in damages for an intentional violation of that
statute if the district itself "was unaware of the discrimination." Ante, at 287. The Court reasons that because administrative proceedings to terminate funding cannot be
commenced until after the grant recipient has received notice
of its noncompliance and the agency determines that voluntary compliance is not possible, see 20 U. S. C. $ 1682, there
should be no damages liability unless the grant recipient has
actual notice of the violation (and thus an opportunity to end
the harassment). See ante, at 288-290.

The fact that Congress has specified a particular administrative procedure to be followed when a subsidy is to be terminated, however, does not illuminate the question of what
the victim of discrimination on the basis of sex must prove
in order to recover damages in an implied private right of
action. Indeed, in Franklin, 503 U. S., at 64, n. 3, we noted
that the Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights had
declined to terminate federal funding of the school district
at issue--despite its finding that a Title IX violation had
occurred--because the "district [had come] into compliance"
with Title IX after the harassment at issue. See ante, at

Stevens, J., dissenting
289. That fact did not affect the Court's analysis, much lesspersuade the Court that a damages remedy was unavailable.

Cf. Cannon, 441 U. S., at 711 ("The fact that other provisionsof a complex statutory scheme create express remedies has
not been accepted as a sufficient reason for refusing to implyan otherwise appropriate remedy under a separate section").

The majority's inappropriate reliance on Title IX's admin-istrative enforcement scheme to limit the availability of a
damages remedy leads the Court to require not only actualknowledge on the part of "an official who at a minimum has
authority to address the alleged discrimination and to insti-tute corrective measures on the recipient's behalf," but also
that official's "refus[al] to take action," or "deliberate indif-ference" toward the harassment. Ante, at 290.

13 Presumably, few Title IX plaintiffs who have been victims of inten-tional discrimination will be able to recover damages under

this exceedingly high standard. The Court fails to recog-nize that its holding will virtually "render inutile causes of
action authorized by Congress through a decision that noremedy is available." Franklin, 503 U. S., at 74.

IV
We are not presented with any question concerning theaffirmative defenses that might eliminate or mitigate the

recovery of damages for a Title IX violation. It has beenargued, for example, that a school district that has adopted
and vigorously enforced a policy that is designed to preventsexual harassment and redress the harms that such conduct
may produce should be exonerated from damages liability.14

13 The only decisions the Court cites to support its adoption of such a
stringent standard are cases arising under a quite different statute, 42
U. S. C. $ 1983. See ante, at 291.

14 See Brief for National Education Association as Amicus Curiae 15

(proposing affirmative defense that "the entity had adopted and has
implemented an effective prevention and compliance program").

Stevens, J., dissenting
The Secretary of Education has promulgated regulations directing grant recipients to adopt such policies and disseminate them to students.15 A rule providing an affirmative
defense for districts that adopt and publish such policies
pursuant to the regulations would not likely be helpful to
respondent, however, because it is not at all clear whether
respondent adopted any such policy,16 and there is no evidence that such a policy was made available to students, as
required by regulation.17

A theme that seems to underlie the Court's opinion is a
concern that holding a school district liable in damages might
deprive it of the benefit of the federal subsidy--that the
damages remedy is somehow more onerous than a possible
termination of the federal grant. See, e. g., ante, at 290
(stating that "an award of damages in a particular case might
well exceed a recipient's level of federal funding"). It is possible, of course, that in some cases the recoverable damages,
in either a Title IX action or a state-law tort action, would

15 The school district must "adopt and publish grievance procedures providing for prompt and equitable resolution of student and employee complaints" of discrimination. 34 CFR $ 106.8(b) (1997). The district also
must inform students and their parents of Title IX's antidiscrimination
requirement. $ 106.9.

16 Factual questions remain with respect to whether respondent had

an adequate antidiscrimination policy. Compare App. 44a-45a (affidavit
of superintendent/Title IX coordinator Virginia Collier) (stating that the
district had a policy) with Plaintiffs' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, Record 332; id., Exh. 2 (Collier deposition), at 42, 44 (stating that
the district had no formal policy).

17 The district's superintendent stated that she did not remember if any

handbook alerting students to grievance procedures was disseminated to
students. App. 72a-73a (Collier deposition). Moreover, Gebser herself
stated: "If I had known at the beginning what I was supposed to do when
a teacher starts making sexual advances towards me, I probably would
have reported it. I was bewildered and terrified and I had no idea where
to go from where I was." Id., at 64a-65a.

exceed the amount of a federal grant.18 That is surely notrelevant to the question whether the school district or the

injured student should bear the risk of harm--a risk againstwhich the district, but not the student, can insure. It is not
clear to me why the well-settled rules of law that imposeresponsibility on the principal for the misconduct of its
agents should not apply in this case. As a matter of policy,the Court ranks protection of the school district's purse
above the protection of immature high school students thatthose rules would provide. Because those students are
members of the class for whose special benefit Congressenacted Title IX, that policy choice is not faithful to the
intent of the policymaking branch of our Government.I respectfully dissent.

Justice Ginsburg, with whom Justice Souter and
Justice Breyer join, dissenting.

Justice Stevens' opinion focuses on the standard ofschool district liability for teacher-on-student harassment in

secondary schools. I join that opinion, which reserves thequestion whether a district should be relieved from damages liability if it has in place, and effectively publicizes andenforces, a policy to curtail and redress injuries caused by
sexual harassment. Ante, at 304-305. I think it appro-priate to answer that question for these reasons: (1) the dimensions of a claim are determined not only by the plaintiff 's

allegations, but by the allowable defenses; (2) this Court'spathmarkers are needed to afford guidance to lower courts

and school officials responsible for the implementation ofTitle IX.

In line with the tort law doctrine of avoidable conse-quences, see generally C. McCormick, Law of Damages 127-
159 (1935), I would recognize as an affirmative defense to aTitle IX charge of sexual harassment, an effective policy for
reporting and redressing such misconduct. School districtssubject to Title IX's governance have been instructed by the
Secretary of Education to install procedures for "prompt andequitable resolution" of complaints, 34 CFR $ 106.8(b) (1997),
and the Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights hasdetailed elements of an effective grievance process, with
specific reference to sexual harassment, 62 Fed. Reg. 12034,12044-12045 (1997).

The burden would be the school district's to show thatits internal remedies were adequately publicized and likely
would have provided redress without exposing the com-plainant to undue risk, effort, or expense. Under such a regime, to the extent that a plaintiff unreasonably failed toavail herself of the school district's preventive and remedial
measures, and consequently suffered avoidable harm, shewould not qualify for Title IX relief.

Syllabus

CARON v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe first circuit

No. 97-6270. Argued April 21, 1998--Decided June 22, 1998
Federal law forbids a person convicted of a serious offense to possess any

firearm, 18 U. S. C. $ 922(g)(1), and requires that a three-time violent
felon who violates $ 922(g) receive an enhanced sentence, $ 924(e).
However, a previous conviction is not a predicate for the substantive
offense or the enhanced sentence if the offender's civil rights have been
restored, "unless such . . . restoration . . . expressly provides that the
person may not . . . possess . . . firearms." $ 921(a)(20). Petitioner,
who has an extensive criminal record, was convicted of possessing, inter
alia, six rifles and shotguns in violation of $ 922(g). The District Court
enhanced his sentence based on one California conviction and three
Massachusetts convictions, but the First Circuit vacated the sentence,
concluding that his civil rights had been restored by operation of a
Massachusetts law that permitted him to possess rifles but restricted
his right to carry handguns. On remand, the District Court disregarded the Massachusetts convictions, finding that, because Massachusetts law allowed petitioner to possess rifles, $ 921(a)(20)'s "unless
clause" was not activated, and that the handgun restriction was irrelevant because the case involved rifles and shotguns. The First Circuit
reversed, counting the convictions because petitioner remained subject
to significant firearms restrictions.

Held: The handgun restriction activates the unless clause, making the

Massachusetts convictions count under federal law. The phrase "may
not . . . possess . . . firearms" must be interpreted under either of two
"all-or-nothing" approaches: either it applies when the State forbids one
or more types of firearms, as the Government contends; or it does not
apply if the State permits one or more types of firearms, regardless
of the one possessed in the particular case. This Court agrees with
the Government's approach, under which a state weapons limitation
activates the uniform federal ban on possessing any firearms at all.
Even if a State permitted an offender to have the guns he possessed,
federal law uses the State's determination that the offender is more
dangerous than law-abiding citizens to impose its own broader stricture. Under petitioner's approach, if he had possessed a handgun in
violation of state law, the unless clause would not apply because he could
have possessed a rifle. This approach contradicts a likely, and rational,

Opinion of the Court
congressional intent. Congress, believing that existing state laws provided less than positive assurance that a repeat violent offender no
longer poses an unacceptable risk of dangerousness, intended to keep
guns away from all offenders who might cause harm, even if they were
not deemed dangerous by the States. Dickerson v. New Banner Institute, Inc., 460 U. S. 103, 119, 120. To provide the missing assurance,
federal law must reach primary conduct not covered by state law. The
fact that state law determines the restoration of civil rights does not
mean that state law also controls the unless clause: As to weapons possession, the Federal Government has an interest in a single, national,
protective policy, broader than required by state law. The rule of lenity
does not apply here, since petitioner relies on an implausible reading
of the congressional purpose. See United States v. Shabani, 513 U. S.
10, 17. Pp. 312-317.

Under federal law, a person convicted of a crime punish-able by more than one year in prison may not possess any

an enhanced sentence. $ 924(e). A previous conviction is apredicate for neither the substantive offense nor the sentence enhancement if the offender has had his civil rightsrestored, "unless such . . . restoration of civil rights expressly
provides that the person may not . . . possess . . . firearms."$ 921(a)(20). This is the so-called "unless clause" we now
must interpret. As the ellipses suggest, the statute is more

Opinion of the Court
complex, but the phrase as quoted presents the issue forour decision.

The parties, reflecting a similar division among variousCourts of Appeals, disagree over the interpretation of the
unless clause in the following circumstance. What if theState restoring the offender's rights forbids possession of
some firearms, say pistols, but not others, say rifles? In onesense, he "may not . . . possess . . . firearms" under the unless clause because the ban on specified weapons is a ban on"firearms." In another sense, he can possess firearms under
the unless clause because the state ban is not absolute.Compare,

e. g., United States v. Estrella, 104 F. 3d 3, 8(CA1) (adopting former reading), cert. denied, 521 U. S. 1110

(1997), and United States v. Driscoll, 970 F. 2d 1472, 1480-1481 (CA6 1992) (same), cert. denied, 506 U. S. 1083 (1993),
with United States v. Qualls, 140 F. 3d 824, 826 (CA9 1998)(en banc) (intermediate position), and

United States v. Shoe-maker, 2 F. 3d 53, 55-56 (CA4 1993) (same), cert. denied, 510

U. S. 1047 (1994).The Government contends the class of criminals who "may
not . . . possess . . . firearms" includes those forbidden tohave some guns but not others. On this reading, the restoration of rights is of no effect here, the previous offensesare chargeable, and petitioner's sentence must be enhanced. On appeal, the Government's position prevailed inthe Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, and we now affirm
its judgment. I

Petitioner Gerald Caron has an extensive criminal rec-ord, including felonies. In Massachusetts state court, he
was convicted in 1958 of attempted breaking and enteringat night and, in 1959 and 1963, of breaking and entering at
night. In California state court, he was convicted in 1970 ofassault with intent to commit murder and attempted murder.

In July 1993, petitioner walked into the home of WalterMiller, carrying a semiautomatic rifle. He threatened Miller,

Opinion of the Court
brandished the rifle in his face, and pointed it at his wife, hisdaughters, and his 3-year-old grandson. Police officers disarmed and arrested petitioner.In September 1993, a federal agent called on petitioner at
home to determine if he had other unlawful firearms. Petitioner said he had only flintlock or other antique weapons(not forbidden by law) and owned no conventional firearms. Federal law, the agent told him, forbade his posses-sion of firearms and was not superseded by state law. In
December 1993, agents executed a search warrant at peti-tioner's house, seizing six rifles and shotguns and 6,823
rounds of ammunition.

A federal jury convicted petitioner of four counts of possessing a firearm or ammunition after having been convicted
of a serious offense. See 18 U. S. C. $ 922(g)(1). The District Court enhanced his sentence because he was at least a
three-time violent felon, based on his one California and
three Massachusetts convictions. See $ 924(e). Petitioner
claimed the court should not have counted his Massachusetts
convictions because his civil rights had been restored by operation of Massachusetts law. Massachusetts law allowed
petitioner to possess rifles or shotguns, as he had the necessary firearm permit and his felony convictions were more
than five years old. Mass. Gen. Laws $$ 140:123, 140:129B,
140:129C (1996). The law forbade him to possess handguns outside his home or business. See $$ 140:121, 140:131,
269:10.

At first, the District Court rejected the claim that Massachusetts had restored petitioner's civil rights. It held
civil rights had to be restored by an offender-specific action rather than by operation of law. The First Circuit
disagreed, vacating the sentence and remanding the case.
United States v. Caron, 77 F. 3d 1, 2, 6 (1996) (en banc). We
denied certiorari. 518 U. S. 1027 (1996). On remand, the
District Court, interpreting the unless clause of the federal statute, disregarded the Massachusetts convictions.

312 CARON v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
It ruled Massachusetts law did not forbid petitioner's pos-session of firearms because he could possess rifles. 941 F.

Supp. 238, 251-254 (Mass. 1996). Though Massachusettsrestricted petitioner's right to carry a handgun, the District Court considered the restriction irrelevant becausehis case involved rifles and shotguns. See

ibid. The FirstCircuit reversed, counting the convictions because petitioner remained subject to significant firearms restrictions.We granted certiorari. 522 U. S. 1038 (1998).

II
A federal statute forbids possession of firearms by thoseconvicted of serious offenses. An abbreviated version of the

statute is as follows:

"It shall be unlawful for any person--"(1) who has been convicted in any court of, a crime

punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding oneyear;

. . . . .
"to ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce,or possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition; or to receive any firearm or ammunition whichhas been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign
commerce." 18 U. S. C. $ 922(g).
Three-time violent felons who violate $ 922(g) faceenhanced sentences of at least 15 years' imprisonment.

$ 924(e)(1). "Violent felony" is defined to include burglaryand other crimes creating a serious risk of physical injury.

$ 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). This term includes petitioner's previousoffenses discussed above.

Not all violent felony convictions, however, count for pur-poses of $ 922(g) or $ 924(e). Until 1986, federal law alone
determined whether a state conviction counted, regard-less of whether the State had expunged the conviction.

Dickerson v. New Banner Institute, Inc., 460 U. S. 103, 119-122 (1983). Congress modified this aspect of

Dickerson by
adopting the following language:

"What constitutes a conviction of such a crime shall be
determined in accordance with the law of the jurisdic-tion in which the proceedings were held. Any conviction which has been expunged, or set aside or for whicha person has been pardoned or has had civil rights restored shall not be considered a conviction for purposesof this chapter, unless such pardon, expungement, or
restoration of civil rights expressly provides that the
person may not ship, transport, possess, or receive fire-arms." $ 921(a)(20).

The first sentence and the first clause of the second sentence
define convictions, pardons, expungements, and restorations
of civil rights by reference to the law of the convictingjurisdiction. See

Beecham v. United States, 511 U. S. 368,
371 (1994).Aside from the unless clause, the parties agree Massachusetts law has restored petitioner's civil rights. As for
the unless clause, state law permits him to possess rifles
and shotguns but forbids him to possess handguns outside
his home or business. The question presented is whether
the handgun restriction activates the unless clause, making
the convictions count under federal law.

We note these preliminary points. First, Massachusetts
restored petitioner's civil rights by operation of law rather
than by pardon or the like. This fact makes no difference.
Nothing in the text of $ 921(a)(20) requires a case-by-case
decision to restore civil rights to this particular offender.
While the term "pardon" connotes a case-by-case determination, "restoration of civil rights" does not. Massachusetts
has chosen a broad rule to govern this situation, and federal
law gives effect to its rule. All Courts of Appeals to ad524US2 Unit: $U88 [09-06-00 16:44:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN

dress the point agree. See Caron, 77 F. 3d, at 2; McGrathv. United States, 60 F. 3d 1005, 1008 (CA2 1995), cert. denied,

516 U. S. 1121 (1996); United States v. Hall, 20 F. 3d 1066,1068-1069 (CA10 1994); United States v. Glaser, 14 F. 3d

1990).Second, the District Court ruled, and petitioner urges
here, that the unless clause allows an offender to possesswhat state law permits him to possess, and nothing more.
Here, petitioner's shotguns and rifles were permitted bystate law, so, under their theory, the weapons would not be
covered by the unless clause. While we do not dispute thecommon sense of this approach, the words of the statute
do not permit it. The unless clause is activated if a resto-ration of civil rights "expressly provides that the person
may not . . . possess . . . firearms." 18 U. S. C. $ 921(a)(20).Either the restorations forbade possession of "firearms" and
the convictions count for all purposes, or they did not andthe convictions count not at all. The unless clause looks to
the terms of the past restorations alone and does not referto the weapons at issue in the present case. So if the Massachusetts convictions count for some purposes, they count forall and bar possession of all guns.

III
The phrase "may not . . . possess . . . firearms," then, mustbe interpreted under either of what the parties call the two

"all-or-nothing" approaches. Either it applies when theState forbids one or more types of firearms, as the Government contends; or it does not apply if state law permits oneor more types of firearms, regardless of the one possessed in
the particular case.

Opinion of the Court
Under the Government's approach, a state weapons limi-tation on an offender activates the uniform federal ban on

possessing any firearms at all. This is so even if the gunsthe offender possessed were ones the State permitted him
to have. The State has singled out the offender as more
dangerous than law-abiding citizens, and federal law usesthis determination to impose its own broader stricture.

Although either reading creates incongruities, petitioner'sapproach yields results contrary to a likely, and rational, congressional policy. If permission to possess one firearm en-tailed permission to possess all, then state permission to
have a pistol would allow possession of an assault weapon
as well. Under this view, if petitioner, in violation of state
law, had possessed a handgun, the unless clause would still
not apply because he could have possessed a rifle. Not only
would this strange result be inconsistent with any conceivable federal policy, but it also would arise often enough to
impair the working of the federal statute. Massachusetts,
in this case, and some 15 other States choose to restore civil
rights while restricting firearm rights in part. The permissive reading would make these partial restrictions a
nullity under federal law, indeed in the egregious cases
with the most dangerous weapons. Congress cannot have
intended this bizarre result.

Under petitioner's all-or-nothing argument, federal law
would forbid only a subset of activities already criminal
under state law. This limitation would contradict the intent
of Congress. In Congress' view, existing state laws "provide less than positive assurance that the person in question
no longer poses an unacceptable risk of dangerousness."
Dickerson, 460 U. S., at 120. Congress meant to keep guns
away from all offenders who, the Federal Government
feared, might cause harm, even if those persons were not
deemed dangerous by States. See id., at 119. If federal
law is to provide the missing "positive assurance," it must
reach primary conduct not covered by state law. The need

524US2 Unit: $U88 [09-06-00 16:44:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN
316 CARON v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
for this caution is borne out by petitioner's rifle attack on
the Miller family, in which petitioner used a gun permitted
by state law. Any other result would reduce federal law to
a sentence enhancement for some state-law violations, a result inconsistent with the congressional intent we recognized
in Dickerson. Permission to possess one gun cannot mean
permission to possess all.

Congress responded to our ruling in Dickerson by providing that the law of the State of conviction, not federal law,
determines the restoration of civil rights as a rule. While
state law is the source of law for restorations of other civil
rights, however, it does not follow that state law also controls
the unless clause. Under the Government's approach, with
which we agree, the federal policy still governs the interpretation of the unless clause. We see nothing contradictory in this analysis. Restoration of the right to vote, the
right to hold office, and the right to sit on a jury turns on so
many complexities and nuances that state law is the most
convenient source for definition. As to the possession of
weapons, however, the Federal Government has an interest
in a single, national, protective policy, broader than required
by state law. Petitioner's approach would undermine this
protective purpose.

As a final matter, petitioner says his reading is required
by the rule of lenity, but his argument is unavailing. The
rule of lenity is not invoked by a grammatical possibility.
It does not apply if the ambiguous reading relied on is an
implausible reading of the congressional purpose. See
United States v. Shabani, 513 U. S. 10, 17 (1994) (requiring
use of traditional tools of statutory construction to resolve
ambiguities before resorting to the rule of lenity). For the
reasons we have explained, petitioner's reading is not plausible enough to satisfy this condition.

In sum, Massachusetts treats petitioner as too dangerous to trust with handguns, though it accords this right to

law-abiding citizens. Federal law uses this state findingof dangerousness in forbidding petitioner to have any guns.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is Affirmed.

Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Scalia and Justice Souter join, dissenting.

The only limitation that Massachusetts law imposed onpetitioner's possession of firearms was that he could not

carry handguns outside his home or business. See ante,at 311. In my view, Massachusetts law did not "expressly
provid[e]" that petitioner "may not . . . possess . . . firearms,"18 U. S. C. $ 921(a)(20), and thus petitioner cannot be sentenced as an armed career criminal under $ 924(e). Becausethe Court holds to the contrary, I respectfully dissent.

Petitioner's prior Massachusetts convictions qualify asviolent felonies for purposes of $ 924(e) only if the "restoration of [his] civil rights" by operation of Massachusettslaw "expressly provide[d] that [petitioner] may not . . .
possess . . . firearms." $ 921(a)(20). In 1994, Massachu-setts law did not expressly provide that petitioner could not
possess firearms. To the contrary: Petitioner was permit-ted by Massachusetts law to possess shotguns, rifles, and
handguns. See ante, at 311; Mass. Gen. Laws $$ 140:123,140:129B, 140:129C (1996). Indeed, Massachusetts provided
petitioner with a firearm identification card that enabled himto possess such firearms.* The only restriction Massachusetts law placed on petitioner's possession of firearms was
that he could not carry handguns outside his home or busi-ness. See $ 269:10(A). By prohibiting petitioner from pos*Petitioner was "entitled to" a firearm identification card five years

also Commonwealth v. Landry, 6 Mass. App. 404, 406, 376 N. E. 2d 1243,
1245 (1978) (firearm identification card can be obtained as a "matter of
right").

Thomas, J., dissenting
sessing only certain firearms (handguns) in only certainplaces (outside his home or office), Massachusetts law did not

expressly provide that petitioner could not possess firearms.The plain meaning of $ 921(a)(20) thus resolves this case.
The Court, however, rejects this plain meaning on the basis
of "a likely, and rational, congressional policy" of prohibitingfirearms possession by all ex-felons whose ability to possess

certain firearms is in any way restricted by state law. Ante,at 315. According to the Court, Congress could not have
intended the "bizarre result" that a conviction would notcount as a violent felony if a State only partially restricts
the possession of firearms by the ex-felon. But this would
not be a bizarre result at all. Under $ 921(a)(20), state-law
limitations on firearms possession are only relevant once it
has been established that an ex-felon's other civil rights, such
as the right to vote, the right to seek and to hold public
office, and the right to serve on a jury, have been restored.
See 77 F. 3d 1, 2 (CA1 1996). In restoring those rights, the
State has presumably deemed such ex-felons worthy of participating in civic life. Once a State makes such a decision,
it is entirely rational (and certainly not bizarre) for Congress
to authorize the increased sentences in $ 924(e) only when the
State additionally prohibits those ex-felons from possessing
firearms altogether.

Moreover, as the Court concedes, its own interpretation
creates "incongruities." Ante, at 315. Under the statute,
whether a prior state conviction qualifies as a violent felony
conviction under $ 924(e) turns entirely on state law. Given
the primacy of state law in the statutory scheme, it is bizarre
to hold that the legal possession of firearms under state law
subjects a person to a sentence enhancement under federal
law. That, however, is precisely the conclusion the Court
reaches in this case. It is simply not true, as the Court
reasons, that federal law "must reach primary conduct not
covered by state law." Ibid. It is entirely plausible that
Congress simply intended to create stiffer penalties for

Thomas, J., dissenting
weapons possessions that are already illegal under state law.And such a purpose is consistent with the statutory direction

that state law controls what constitutes a conviction for aviolent felony.

I believe that the plain meaning of the statute is that Massachusetts did not "expressly provid[e]" that petitioner "maynot . . . possess . . . firearms." At the very least, this interpretation is a plausible one. Indeed, both the Governmentand the Court concede as much. See Brief for United States
16 ("grammatically possible" to read statute to say that itscondition is not satisfied if the State does permit its felons
to possess some firearms); ante, at 316 (this "reading is not
plausible enough"). Accordingly, it is far from clear under
the statute that a prior state conviction counts as a violent
felony conviction for purposes of $ 924(e) just because the
State imposes some restriction, no matter how slight, on
firearms possession by ex-felons. The rule of lenity must
therefore apply: "[T]he Court will not interpret a federal
criminal statute so as to increase the penalty that it places
on an individual when such an interpretation can be based
on no more than a guess as to what Congress intended."
Ladner v. United States, 358 U. S. 169, 178 (1958). Ex-felons
cannot be expected to realize that a federal statute that
explicitly relies on state law prohibits behavior that state
law allows.

The Court rejects the rule of lenity in this case because
it thinks the purported statutory ambiguity rests on a
"grammatical possibility" and "an implausible reading of the
congressional purpose." Ante, at 316. But the alleged ambiguity does not result from a mere grammatical possibility;
it exists because of an interpretation that, for the reasons
I have described, both accords with a natural reading of
the statutory language and is consistent with the statutory
purpose.

The plain meaning of $ 921(a)(20) is that Massachusetts
law did not "expressly provid[e] that [petitioner] may not . . .

I would therefore reverse the judgment below.

321OCTOBER TERM, 1997
Syllabus

UNITED STATES v. BAJAKAJIAN
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 96-1487. Argued November 4, 1997--Decided June 22, 1998
After customs inspectors found respondent and his family preparing to

board an international flight carrying $357,144, he was charged with,
inter alia, attempting to leave the United States without reporting, as
required by 31 U. S. C. $ 5316(a)(1)(A), that he was transporting more
than $10,000 in currency. The Government also sought forfeiture of
the $357,144 under 18 U. S. C. $ 982(a)(1), which provides that a person
convicted of willfully violating $ 5316 shall forfeit "any property . . .
involved in such an offense." Respondent pleaded guilty to the failure
to report and elected to have a bench trial on the forfeiture. The District Court found, among other things, that the entire $357,144 was subject to forfeiture because it was "involved in" the offense, that the funds
were not connected to any other crime, and that respondent was transporting the money to repay a lawful debt. Concluding that full forfeiture would be grossly disproportional to the offense in question
and would therefore violate the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth
Amendment, the court ordered forfeiture of $15,000, in addition to three
years' probation and the maximum fine of $5,000 under the Sentencing
Guidelines. The Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding that a forfeiture must
fulfill two conditions to satisfy the Clause: The property forfeited must
be an "instrumentality" of the crime committed, and the property's
value must be proportional to its owner's culpability. The court determined that respondent's currency was not an "instrumentality" of the
crime of failure to report, which involves the withholding of information
rather than the possession or transportation of money; that, therefore,

$ 982(a)(1) could never satisfy the Clause in a currency forfeiture case;
that it was unnecessary to apply the "proportionality" prong of the test;
and that the Clause did not permit forfeiture of any of the unreported
currency, but that the court lacked jurisdiction to set the $15,000 forfeiture aside because respondent had not cross-appealed to challenge it.

Held: Full forfeiture of respondent's $357,144 would violate the Excessive

Fines Clause. Pp. 327-344.

(a) The forfeiture at issue is a "fine" within the meaning of the Clause,
which provides that "excessive fines [shall not be] imposed." The
Clause limits the Government's power to extract payments, whether in
cash or in kind, as punishment for some offense. Austin v. United

Syllabus
States, 509 U. S. 602, 609-610. Forfeitures--payments in kind--are
thus "fines" if they constitute punishment for an offense. Section
982(a)(1) currency forfeitures do so. The statute directs a court to
order forfeiture as an additional sanction when "imposing sentence on a
person convicted of" a willful violation of $ 5316's reporting requirement. The forfeiture is thus imposed at the culmination of a criminal
proceeding and requires conviction of an underlying felony, and it cannot
be imposed upon an innocent owner of unreported currency. Cf. id., at
619. The Court rejects the Government's argument that such forfeitures serve important remedial purposes--by deterring illicit movements of cash and giving the Government valuable information to investigate and detect criminal activities associated with that cash--because
the asserted loss of information here would not be remedied by confiscation of respondent's $357,144. The Government's argument that the

$ 982(a)(1) forfeiture is constitutional because it falls within a class of
historic forfeitures of property tainted by crime is also rejected. In so
arguing, the Government relies upon a series of cases involving traditional civil in rem forfeitures that are inapposite because such forfeitures were historically considered nonpunitive. See, e. g., The Palmyra,
12 Wheat. 1, 14-15. Section 982(a)(1) descends from a different historical tradition: that of in personam criminal forfeitures. Similarly, the
Court declines to accept the Government's contention that the forfeiture here is constitutional because it involves an "instrumentality" of
respondent's crime. Because instrumentalities historically have been
treated as a form of "guilty property" forfeitable in civil in rem proceedings, it is irrelevant whether respondent's currency is an instrumentality; the forfeiture is punitive, and the test for its excessiveness involves
solely a proportionality determination. Pp. 327-334.

(b) A punitive forfeiture violates the Excessive Fines Clause if it is
grossly disproportional to the gravity of the offense that it is designed
to punish. Although the proportionality principle has always been the
touchstone of the inquiry, see, e. g., Austin, supra, at 622-623, the
Clause's text and history provide little guidance as to how disproportional a forfeiture must be to be "excessive." Until today, the Court
has not articulated a governing standard. In deriving the standard,
the Court finds two considerations particularly relevant. The first, previously emphasized in cases interpreting the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause, is that judgments about the appropriate punishment belong in the first instance to the legislature. See, e. g., Solem v. Helm,
463 U. S. 277, 290. The second is that any judicial determination regarding the gravity of a particular criminal offense will be inherently
imprecise. Because both considerations counsel against requiring strict

Syllabus
proportionality, the Court adopts the gross disproportionality standard
articulated in, e. g., id., at 288. Pp. 334-337.

(c) The forfeiture of respondent's entire $357,144 would be grossly
disproportional to the gravity of his offense. His crime was solely a
reporting offense. It was permissible to transport the currency out of
the country so long as he reported it. And because $ 982(a)(1) orders
currency forfeited for a "willful" reporting violation, the essence of the
crime is a willful failure to report. Furthermore, the District Court
found his violation to be unrelated to any other illegal activities. Whatever his other vices, respondent does not fit into the class of persons
for whom the statute was principally designed: money launderers, drug
traffickers, and tax evaders. And the maximum penalties that could
have been imposed under the Sentencing Guidelines, a 6-month sentence
and a $5,000 fine, confirm a minimal level of culpability and are dwarfed
by the $357,144 forfeiture sought by the Government. The harm that
respondent caused was also minimal. The failure to report affected
only the Government, and in a relatively minor way. There was no
fraud on the Government and no loss to the public fisc. Had his crime
gone undetected, the Government would have been deprived only of
the information that $357,144 had left the country. Thus, there is no
articulable correlation between the $357,144 and any Government injury. Pp. 337-340.

(d) The Court rejects the contention that the proportionality of full
forfeiture is demonstrated by the fact that the First Congress, at
roughly the same time the Eighth Amendment was ratified, enacted
statutes requiring full forfeiture of goods involved in customs offenses
or the payment of monetary penalties proportioned to the goods' value.
The early customs statutes do not support the Government's assertion
because, unlike $ 982(a)(1), the type of forfeiture they imposed was not
considered punishment for a criminal offense, but rather was civil in
rem forfeiture, in which the Government proceeded against the "guilty"
property itself. See, e. g., Harford v. United States, 8 Cranch 109.
Similarly, the early statutes imposing monetary "forfeitures" proportioned to the value of the goods involved were considered not as punishment for an offense, but rather as serving the remedial purpose of reimbursing the Government for the losses accruing from evasion of customs
duties. See, e. g., Stockwell v. United States, 13 Wall. 531, 546-547.

Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.
Respondent Hosep Bajakajian attempted to leave theUnited States without reporting, as required by federal law,

that he was transporting more than $10,000 in currency.Federal law also provides that a person convicted of willfully
violating this reporting requirement shall forfeit to the Gov-ernment "any property . . . involved in such offense." 18
U. S. C. $ 982(a)(1). The question in this case is whether for-feiture of the entire $357,144 that respondent failed to declare would violate the Excessive Fines Clause of the EighthAmendment. We hold that it would, because full forfeiture
of respondent's currency would be grossly disproportional tothe gravity of his offense.

On June 9, 1994, respondent, his wife, and his two daugh-ters were waiting at Los Angeles International Airport to

board a flight to Italy; their final destination was Cyprus.Using dogs trained to detect currency by its smell, customs
inspectors discovered some $230,000 in cash in the Bajakaji-ans' checked baggage. A customs inspector approached respondent and his wife and told them that they were requiredto report all money in excess of $10,000 in their possession
or in their baggage. Respondent said that he had $8,000 and

that his wife had another $7,000, but that the family had noadditional currency to declare. A search of their carry-on

bags, purse, and wallet revealed more cash; in all, customsinspectors found $357,144. The currency was seized and
respondent was taken into custody.A federal grand jury indicted respondent on three counts.
Count One charged him with failing to report, as requiredby 31 U. S. C. $ 5316(a)(1)(A),

1 that he was transporting more

than $10,000 outside the United States, and with doing so"willfully," in violation of $ 5322(a).

2 Count Two charged

him with making a false material statement to the UnitedStates Customs Service, in violation of 18 U. S. C. $ 1001.

Count Three sought forfeiture of the $357,144 pursuant to 18U. S. C. $ 982(a)(1), which provides:

"The court, in imposing sentence on a person convictedof an offense in violation of section . . . 5316, . . . shall
order that the person forfeit to the United States anyproperty, real or personal, involved in such offense, or
any property traceable to such property." 18 U. S. C.$ 982(a)(1).

statement charge in Count Two; and respondent elected tohave a bench trial on the forfeiture in Count Three. After

in" the offense. Ibid. The court also found that the fundswere not connected to any other crime and that respondent

was transporting the money to repay a lawful debt. Tr.61-62 (Jan. 19, 1995). The District Court further found that
respondent had failed to report that he was taking the currency out of the United States because of fear stemmingfrom "cultural differences": Respondent, who had grown up

as a member of the Armenian minority in Syria, had a "dis-trust for the Government."

Id., at 63; see Tr. of Oral Arg.
30.Although $ 982(a)(1) directs sentencing courts to impose

full forfeiture, the District Court concluded that such forfeiture would be "extraordinarily harsh" and "grossly disproportionate to the offense in question," and that it would therefore violate the Excessive Fines Clause. Tr. 63. The court
instead ordered forfeiture of $15,000, in addition to a sentence of three years of probation and a fine of $5,000--the
maximum fine under the Sentencing Guidelines--because the
court believed that the maximum Guidelines fine was "too
little" and that a $15,000 forfeiture would "make up for what
I think a reasonable fine should be." Ibid.

The United States appealed, seeking full forfeiture of respondent's currency as provided in $ 982(a)(1). The Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed. 84 F. 3d 334 (1996).
Applying Circuit precedent, the court held that, to satisfy
the Excessive Fines Clause, a forfeiture must fulfill two conditions: The property forfeited must be an "instrumentality"
of the crime committed, and the value of the property must
be proportional to the culpability of the owner. Id., at 336
(citing United States v. Real Property Located in El Dorado
County, 59 F. 3d 974, 982 (CA9 1995)). A majority of the
panel determined that the currency was not an "instrumentality" of the crime of failure to report because " `[t]he crime

in United States Currency, 62 F. 3d 1161, 1167 (CA9 1995)).The majority therefore held that $ 982(a)(1) could never satisfy the Excessive Fines Clause in cases involving forfeituresof currency and that it was unnecessary to apply the "proportionality" prong of the test. Although the panel majorityconcluded that the Excessive Fines Clause did not permit
forfeiture of any of the unreported currency, it held that itlacked jurisdiction to set the $15,000 forfeiture aside because
respondent had not cross-appealed to challenge that forfeit-ure. 84 F. 3d, at 338.

Judge Wallace concurred in the result. He viewed re-spondent's currency as an instrumentality of the crime because "without the currency, there can be no offense," id., at339, and he criticized the majority for "strik[ing] down a portion of " the statute, id., at 338. He nonetheless agreed thatfull forfeiture would violate the Excessive Fines Clause in
respondent's case, based upon the "proportionality" prong ofthe Ninth Circuit test. Finding no clear error in the District Court's factual findings, he concluded that the reducedforfeiture of $15,000 was proportional to respondent's culpability. Id., at 339-340.Because the Court of Appeals' holding--that the forfeiture
ordered by $ 982(a)(1) was per se unconstitutional in cases ofcurrency forfeiture--invalidated a portion of an Act of Congress, we granted certiorari. 520 U. S. 1239 (1997).

The Eighth Amendment provides: "Excessive bail shallnot be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and

unusual punishments inflicted." U. S. Const., Amdt. 8.This Court has had little occasion to interpret, and has never
actually applied, the Excessive Fines Clause. We have,however, explained that at the time the Constitution
was adopted, "the word `fine' was understood to mean apayment to a sovereign as punishment for some offense."

Opinion of the Court
Inc., 492 U. S. 257, 265 (1989). The Excessive Fines Clausethus "limits the government's power to extract payments,

whether in cash or in kind, `as punishment for some of-fense.' "

Austin v. United States, 509 U. S. 602, 609-610
(1993) (emphasis deleted). Forfeitures--payments in kind--
are thus "fines" if they constitute punishment for an offense.We have little trouble concluding that the forfeiture of currency ordered by $ 982(a)(1) constitutes punishment. Thestatute directs a court to order forfeiture as an additional
sanction when "imposing sentence on a person convicted of "a willful violation of $ 5316's reporting requirement. The
forfeiture is thus imposed at the culmination of a criminalproceeding and requires conviction of an underlying felony,
and it cannot be imposed upon an innocent owner of unreported currency, but only upon a person who has himselfbeen convicted of a $ 5316 reporting violation.

3 Cf. id., at

619 (holding forfeiture to be a "fine" in part because the
forfeiture statute "expressly provide[d] an `innocent owner'
defense" and thus "look[ed] . . . like punishment").

3 Although the currency reporting statute provides that "a person or an
agent or bailee of the person shall file a report," 31 U. S. C. $ 5316(a), the
statute ordering the criminal forfeiture of unreported currency provides
that "[t]he court, in imposing sentence on a person convicted of" failure to
file the required report, "shall order that the person forfeit to the United
States" any property "involved in" or "traceable to" the offense, 18 U. S. C.

$ 982(a)(1). The combined effect of these two statutes is that an owner of
unreported currency is not subject to criminal forfeiture if his agent or
bailee is the one who fails to file the required report, because such an
owner could not be convicted of the reporting offense. The United States
endorsed this interpretation at oral argument in this case. See Tr. of
Oral Arg. 24-25.

For this reason, the dissent's speculation about the effect of today's holding on "kingpins" and "cash couriers" is misplaced. See post, at 352, 354.
Section 982(a)(1)'s criminal in personam forfeiture reaches only currency
owned by someone who himself commits a reporting crime. It is unlikely
that the Government, in the course of criminally indicting and prosecuting
a cash courier, would not bother to investigate the source and true ownership of unreported funds.

Opinion of the Court
The United States argues, however, that the forfeiture ofcurrency under $ 982(a)(1) "also serves important remedial

purposes." Brief for United States 20. The Governmentasserts that it has "an overriding sovereign interest in controlling what property leaves and enters the country." Ibid.It claims that full forfeiture of unreported currency supports
that interest by serving to "dete[r] illicit movements of cash"and aiding in providing the Government with "valuable information to investigate and detect criminal activities associ-ated with that cash."

Id., at 21. Deterrence, however, hastraditionally been viewed as a goal of punishment, and

forfeiture of the currency here does not serve the remedialpurpose of compensating the Government for a loss. See
Black's Law Dictionary 1293 (6th ed. 1990) ("[R]emedial ac-tion" is one "brought to obtain compensation or indemnity");
One Lot Emerald Cut Stones v. United States, 409 U. S.232 (1972)

(per curiam) (monetary penalty provides "a rea-sonable form of liquidated damages," id., at 237, to the

Government and is thus a "remedial" sanction because itcompensates Government for lost revenues). Although the
Government has asserted a loss of information regarding theamount of currency leaving the country, that loss would not
be remedied by the Government's confiscation of respond-ent's $357,144.

The United States also argues that the forfeiture man-dated by $ 982(a)(1) is constitutional because it falls within a

class of historic forfeitures of property tainted by crime.See Brief for United States 16 (citing,

inter alia, The Pal4 We do not suggest that merely because the forfeiture of respondent's
currency in this case would not serve a remedial purpose, other forfeitures
may be classified as nonpunitive (and thus not "fines") if they serve some
remedial purpose as well as being punishment for an offense. Even if the
Government were correct in claiming that the forfeiture of respondent's
currency is remedial in some way, the forfeiture would still be punitive in
part. (The Government concedes as much.) This is sufficient to bring
the forfeiture within the purview of the Excessive Fines Clause. See
Austin v. United States, 509 U. S. 602, 621-622 (1993).

In so doing, the Government reliesupon a series of cases involving traditional civil in rem forfeitures that are inapposite because such forfeitures werehistorically considered nonpunitive.

The theory behind such forfeitures was the fiction that the
action was directed against "guilty property," rather thanagainst the offender himself.

5 See, e. g., Various Items of

Personal Property v. United States, 282 U. S. 577, 581 (1931)("[I]t is the property which is proceeded against, and, by

resort to a legal fiction, held guilty and condemned as thoughit were conscious instead of inanimate and insentient"); see
also R. Waples, Proceedings In Rem 13, 205-209 (1882).Historically, the conduct of the property owner was irrelevant; indeed, the owner of forfeited property could be entirely innocent of any crime. See, e. g., Origet v. United
States, 125 U. S. 240, 246 (1888) ("[T]he merchandise is to be
forfeited irrespective of any criminal prosecution. . . . Theperson punished for the offence may be an entirely different

person from the owner of the merchandise, or any personinterested in it. The forfeiture of the goods of the principal
can form no part of the personal punishment of his agent").As Justice Story explained:

"The thing is here primarily considered as the offender,or rather the offence is attached primarily to the thing;
and this, whether the offence be malum prohibitum, or
5 The "guilty property" theory behind in rem forfeiture can be traced to
the Bible, which describes property being sacrificed to God as a means of
atoning for an offense. See Exodus 21:28. In medieval Europe and at
common law, this concept evolved into the law of deodand, in which offending property was condemned and confiscated by the church or the Crown
in remediation for the harm it had caused. See 1 M. Hale, Pleas of the
Crown 420-424 (1st Am. ed. 1847); 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the
Laws of England 290-292 (1765); O. Holmes, The Common Law 10-13,

Traditional in rem forfeitures were thus not consideredpunishment against the individual for an offense. See

id., at14; Dobbins's Distillery v. United States, supra, at 401; Van

267, 293 (1996) (Kennedy, J., concurring) ("[C]ivil in remforfeiture is not punishment of the wrongdoer for his criminal offense"). Because they were viewed as nonpunitive,such forfeitures traditionally were considered to occupy a
place outside the domain of the Excessive Fines Clause.Recognizing the nonpunitive character of such proceedings,
we have held that the Double Jeopardy Clause does not barthe institution of a civil,

in rem forfeiture action after thecriminal conviction of the defendant. See

id., at 278.6The forfeiture in this case does not bear any of the hallmarks of traditional civil in rem forfeitures. The Govern6 It does not follow, of course, that all modern civil in rem forfeitures are
nonpunitive and thus beyond the coverage of the Excessive Fines Clause.
Because some recent federal forfeiture laws have blurred the traditional
distinction between civil in rem and criminal in personam forfeiture, we
have held that a modern statutory forfeiture is a "fine" for Eighth Amendment purposes if it constitutes punishment even in part, regardless of
whether the proceeding is styled in rem or in personam. See Austin v.
United States, supra, at 621-622 (although labeled in rem, civil forfeiture
of real property used "to facilitate" the commission of drug crimes was
punitive in part and thus subject to review under the Excessive Fines
Clause).

Opinion of the Court
ment has not proceeded against the currency itself, but has
instead sought and obtained a criminal conviction of respondent personally. The forfeiture serves no remedial purpose,
is designed to punish the offender, and cannot be imposed
upon innocent owners.

Section 982(a)(1) thus descends not from historic in rem
forfeitures of guilty property, but from a different historical
tradition: that of in personam, criminal forfeitures. Such
forfeitures have historically been treated as punitive, being
part of the punishment imposed for felonies and treason in
the Middle Ages and at common law. See W. McKechnie,
Magna Carta 337-339 (2d ed. 1958); 2 F. Pollock & F. Maitland, The History of English Law 460-466 (2d ed. 1909). Although in personam criminal forfeitures were well established in England at the time of the founding, they were
rejected altogether in the laws of this country until very
recently.7

7 The First Congress explicitly rejected in personam forfeitures as punishments for federal crimes, see Act of Apr. 30, 1790, ch. 9, $ 24, 1 Stat.
117 ("[N]o conviction or judgment . . . shall work corruption of blood, or
any forfeiture of estate"), and Congress reenacted this ban several times
over the course of two centuries. See Rev. Stat. $ 5326 (1875); Act of Mar.
4, 1909, ch. 321, $ 341, 35 Stat. 1159; Act of June 25, 1948, ch. 645, $ 3563,

Nov. 1, 1987, Pub. L. 98-473, 98 Stat. 1987.

It was only in 1970 that Congress resurrected the English common law
of punitive forfeiture to combat organized crime and major drug trafficking. See Organized Crime Control Act of 1970, 18 U. S. C. $ 1963, and
Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, 21
U. S. C. $ 848(a). In providing for this mode of punishment, which had
long been unused in this country, the Senate Judiciary Committee acknowledged that "criminal forfeiture . . . represents an innovative attempt
to call on our common law heritage to meet an essentially modern problem." S. Rep. No. 91-617, p. 79 (1969). Indeed, it was not until 1992 that
Congress provided for the criminal forfeiture of currency at issue here.

Opinion of the Court
The Government specifically contends that the forfeiture
of respondent's currency is constitutional because it involves
an "instrumentality" of respondent's crime.8 According to
the Government, the unreported cash is an instrumentality
because it "does not merely facilitate a violation of law," but
is " `the very sine qua non of the crime.' " Brief for United
States 20 (quoting United States v. United States Currency
in the Amount of One Hundred Forty-Five Thousand, One
Hundred Thirty-Nine Dollars, 18 F. 3d 73, 75 (CA2), cert.
denied sub nom. Etim v. United States, 513 U. S. 815 (1994)).
The Government reasons that "there would be no violation
at all without the exportation (or attempted exportation) of
the cash." Brief for United States 20.

Acceptance of the Government's argument would require
us to expand the traditional understanding of instrumentality forfeitures. This we decline to do. Instrumentalities
historically have been treated as a form of "guilty property"
that can be forfeited in civil in rem proceedings. In this
case, however, the Government has sought to punish respondent by proceeding against him criminally, in personam,
rather than proceeding in rem against the currency. It is
therefore irrelevant whether respondent's currency is an
instrumentality; the forfeiture is punitive, and the test for

8 Although the term "instrumentality" is of recent vintage, see Austin
v. United States, 509 U. S., at 627-628 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and
concurring in judgment), it fairly characterizes property that historically
was subject to forfeiture because it was the actual means by which an
offense was committed. See infra this page; see, e. g., J. W. Goldsmith,
Jr.-Grant Co. v. United States, 254 U. S. 505, 508-510 (1921). "Instrumentality" forfeitures have historically been limited to the property actually
used to commit an offense and no more. See Austin v. United States,
supra, at 627-628 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). A forfeiture that reaches beyond this strict historical limitation
is ipso facto punitive and therefore subject to review under the Excessive
Fines Clause.

334 UNITED STATES v. BAJAKAJIAN

Opinion of the Court
the excessiveness of a punitive forfeiture involves solelya proportionality determination. See infra this page and

335-337.9 III

Because the forfeiture of respondent's currency constitutespunishment and is thus a "fine" within the meaning of
the Excessive Fines Clause, we now turn to the questionwhether it is "excessive."

A
The touchstone of the constitutional inquiry under the Ex-cessive Fines Clause is the principle of proportionality: The

amount of the forfeiture must bear some relationship to thegravity of the offense that it is designed to punish. See
Austin v. United States, 509 U. S., at 622-623 (noting Courtof Appeals' statement that " `the government is exacting too
high a penalty in relation to the offense committed' "); Alexander v. United States, 509 U. S. 544, 559 (1993) ("It is inthe light of the extensive criminal activities which petitioner

apparently conducted . . . that the question whether the for-feiture was `excessive' must be considered"). Until today,
however, we have not articulated a standard for determiningwhether a punitive forfeiture is constitutionally excessive.
We now hold that a punitive forfeiture violates the ExcessiveFines Clause if it is grossly disproportional to the gravity of
a defendant's offense.

9 The currency in question is not an instrumentality in any event. The
Court of Appeals reasoned that the existence of the currency as a "precondition" to the reporting requirement did not make it an "instrumentality"
of the offense. See 84 F. 3d 334, 337 (CA9 1996). We agree; the currency
is merely the subject of the crime of failure to report. Cash in a suitcase
does not facilitate the commission of that crime as, for example, an automobile facilitates the transportation of goods concealed to avoid taxes.
See, e. g., J. W. Goldsmith, Jr.-Grant Co. v. United States, supra, at 508.
In the latter instance, the property is the actual means by which the criminal act is committed. See Black's Law Dictionary 801 (6th ed. 1990) ("Instrumentality" is "[s]omething by which an end is achieved; a means,
medium, agency").

Opinion of the Court
The text and history of the Excessive Fines Clause demon-strate the centrality of proportionality to the excessiveness

inquiry; nonetheless, they provide little guidance as to howdisproportional a punitive forfeiture must be to the gravity
of an offense in order to be "excessive." Excessive meanssurpassing the usual, the proper, or a normal measure of
proportion. See 1 N. Webster, American Dictionary of theEnglish Language (1828) (defining excessive as "beyond the
common measure or proportion"); S. Johnson, A Dictionaryof the English Language 680 (4th ed. 1773) ("[b]eyond the
common proportion"). The constitutional question that weaddress, however, is just how proportional to a criminal offense a fine must be, and the text of the Excessive FinesClause does not answer it.

Nor does its history. The Clause was little discussed inthe First Congress and the debates over the ratification of
the Bill of Rights. As we have previously noted, the Clausewas taken verbatim from the English Bill of Rights of 1689.
See Browning-Ferris Industries of Vt., Inc. v. Kelco Disposal, Inc., 492 U. S., at 266-267. That document's prohibi-tion against excessive fines was a reaction to the abuses of

the King's judges during the reigns of the Stuarts, id., at267, but the fines that those judges imposed were described
contemporaneously only in the most general terms. SeeEarl of Devonshire's Case, 11 State Tr. 1367, 1372 (H. L.
1689) (fine of #30,000 "excessive and exorbitant, againstMagna Charta, the common right of the subject, and the law
of the land"). Similarly, Magna Charta--which the Stuartjudges were accused of subverting--required only that
amercements (the medieval predecessors of fines) should beproportioned to the offense and that they should not deprive
a wrongdoer of his livelihood:

"A Free-man shall not be amerced for a small fault,but after the manner of the fault; and for a great fault

after the greatness thereof, saving to him his contene-ment; (2) and a Merchant likewise, saving to him his

Opinion of the Court
merchandise; (3) and any other's villain than ours shallbe likewise amerced, saving his wainage." Magna

Charta, 9 Hen. III, ch. 14 (1225), 1 Stat. at Large 6-7(1762 ed.).

None of these sources suggests how disproportional to thegravity of an offense a fine must be in order to be deemed
constitutionally excessive.We must therefore rely on other considerations in deriving
a constitutional excessiveness standard, and there are twothat we find particularly relevant. The first, which we have
emphasized in our cases interpreting the Cruel and UnusualPunishments Clause, is that judgments about the appropriate punishment for an offense belong in the first instanceto the legislature. See,

e. g., Solem v. Helm, 463 U. S. 277,290 (1983) ("Reviewing courts . . . should grant substantial

deference to the broad authority that legislatures necessarilypossess in determining the types and limits of punishments
for crimes"); see also Gore v. United States, 357 U. S. 386,393 (1958) ("Whatever views may be entertained regarding
severity of punishment, . . . these are peculiarly questions oflegislative policy"). The second is that any judicial determination regarding the gravity of a particular criminal offensewill be inherently imprecise. Both of these principles counsel against requiring strict proportionality between theamount of a punitive forfeiture and the gravity of a criminal
offense, and we therefore adopt the standard of gross dispro-portionality articulated in our Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause precedents. See, e. g., Solem v. Helm, supra,at 288;

Rummel v. Estelle, 445 U. S. 263, 271 (1980).In applying this standard, the district courts in the first

instance, and the courts of appeals, reviewing the propor-tionality determination de novo,

10 must compare the amount

10 At oral argument, respondent urged that a district court's determination of excessiveness should be reviewed by an appellate court for abuse
of discretion. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 32. We cannot accept this submission.

Opinion of the Court
of the forfeiture to the gravity of the defendant's offense. Ifthe amount of the forfeiture is grossly disproportional to the

gravity of the defendant's offense, it is unconstitutional.

B
Under this standard, the forfeiture of respondent's entire$357,144 would violate the Excessive Fines Clause.

11 Respondent's crime was solely a reporting offense. It was per-missible to transport the currency out of the country so long

as he reported it. Section 982(a)(1) orders currency to beforfeited for a "willful" violation of the reporting requirement. Thus, the essence of respondent's crime is a willfulfailure to report the removal of currency from the United
States.12 Furthermore, as the District Court found, resiveness inquiry, of course, must be accepted unless clearly erroneous.
See Anderson v. Bessemer City, 470 U. S. 564, 574-575 (1985). But the
question whether a fine is constitutionally excessive calls for the application of a constitutional standard to the facts of a particular case, and in
this context de novo review of that question is appropriate. See Ornelas
v. United States, 517 U. S. 690, 697 (1996).

11 The only question before this Court is whether the full forfeiture of

respondent's $357,144 as directed by $ 982(a)(1) is constitutional under the
Excessive Fines Clause. We hold that it is not. The Government petitioned for certiorari seeking full forfeiture, and we reject that request.
Our holding that full forfeiture would be excessive reflects no judgment
that "a forfeiture of even $15,001 would have suffered from a gross disproportion," nor does it "affir[m] the reduced $15,000 forfeiture on de novo
review." Post, at 349. Those issues are simply not before us. Nor, indeed, do we address in any respect the validity of the forfeiture ordered
by the District Court, including whether a court may disregard the terms
of a statute that commands full forfeiture: As noted, supra, at 327, respondent did not cross-appeal the $15,000 forfeiture ordered by the District Court. The Court of Appeals thus declined to address the $15,000
forfeiture, and that question is not properly presented here either.

12 Contrary to the dissent's contention, the nature of the nonreporting

offense in this case was not altered by respondent's "lies" or by the "suspicious circumstances" surrounding his transportation of his currency. See
post, at 352-353. A single willful failure to declare the currency constitutes the crime, the gravity of which is not exacerbated or mitigated by

338 UNITED STATES v. BAJAKAJIAN

Opinion of the Court
spondent's violation was unrelated to any other illegal activities. The money was the proceeds of legal activity and was
to be used to repay a lawful debt. Whatever his other vices,
respondent does not fit into the class of persons for whom
the statute was principally designed: He is not a money
launderer, a drug trafficker, or a tax evader.13 See Brief
for United States 2-3. And under the Sentencing Guidelines, the maximum sentence that could have been imposed
on respondent was six months, while the maximum fine
was $5,000. App. to Pet. for Cert. 17a (transcript of District Court sentencing hearing); United States Sentencing
Commission, Guidelines Manual $ 5(e)1.2, Sentencing Table

"fable[s]" that respondent told one month, or six months, later. See post,
at 352. The Government indicted respondent under 18 U. S. C. $ 1001 for
"lying," but that separate count did not form the basis of the nonreporting
offense for which $ 982(a)(1) orders forfeiture.

Further, the District Court's finding that respondent's lies stemmed
from a fear of the Government because of "cultural differences," supra, at
326, does not mitigate the gravity of his offense. We reject the dissent's
contention that this finding was a "patronizing excuse" that "demeans millions of law-abiding American immigrants by suggesting they cannot be
expected to be as truthful as every other citizen." Post, at 353. We are
confident that the District Court concurred in the dissent's incontrovertible proposition that "[e]ach American, regardless of culture or ethnicity,
is equal before the law." Ibid. The District Court did nothing whatsoever to imply that "cultural differences" excuse lying, but rather made
this finding in the context of establishing that respondent's willful failure
to report the currency was unrelated to any other crime--a finding highly
relevant to the determination of the gravity of respondent's offense. The
dissent's charge of ethnic paternalism on the part of the District Court
finds no support in the record, nor is there any indication that the District
Court's factual finding that respondent "distrust[ed] . . . the Government,"
see supra, at 326, was clearly erroneous.

13 Nor, contrary to the dissent's repeated assertion, see post, at 344, 346-

351, 354, 356, is respondent a "smuggl[er]." Respondent owed no customs
duties to the Government, and it was perfectly legal for him to possess
the $357,144 in cash and to remove it from the United States. His crime
was simply failing to report the wholly legal act of transporting his
currency.

Opinion of the Court
(Nov. 1994). Such penalties confirm a minimal level of
culpability.14

The harm that respondent caused was also minimal. Failure to report his currency affected only one party, the Government, and in a relatively minor way. There was no fraud
on the United States, and respondent caused no loss to the
public fisc. Had his crime gone undetected, the Government
would have been deprived only of the information that
$357,144 had left the country. The Government and the dissent contend that there is a correlation between the amount
forfeited and the harm that the Government would have suffered had the crime gone undetected. See Brief for United
States 30 (forfeiture is "perfectly calibrated"); post, at 344 ("a
fine calibrated with this accuracy"). We disagree. There is
no inherent proportionality in such a forfeiture. It is impossible to conclude, for example, that the harm respondent
caused is anywhere near 30 times greater than that caused
by a hypothetical drug dealer who willfully fails to report
taking $12,000 out of the country in order to purchase drugs.

Comparing the gravity of respondent's crime with the
$357,144 forfeiture the Government seeks, we conclude that
such a forfeiture would be grossly disproportional to the

14 In considering an offense's gravity, the other penalties that the Legislature has authorized are certainly relevant evidence. Here, as the Government and the dissent stress, Congress authorized a maximum fine of
$250,000 plus five years' imprisonment for willfully violating the statutory
reporting requirement, and this suggests that it did not view the reporting
offense as a trivial one. That the maximum fine and Guideline sentence
to which respondent was subject were but a fraction of the penalties authorized, however, undercuts any argument based solely on the statute,
because they show that respondent's culpability relative to other potential
violators of the reporting provision--tax evaders, drug kingpins, or money
launderers, for example--is small indeed. This disproportion is telling
notwithstanding the fact that a separate Guideline provision permits
forfeiture if mandated by statute, see post, at 350-351. That Guideline,
moreover, cannot override the constitutional requirement of proportionality review.

gravity of his offense.15 It is larger than the $5,000 fine im-posed by the District Court by many orders of magnitude,

and it bears no articulable correlation to any injury sufferedby the Government.

C
Finally, we must reject the contention that the proportion-ality of full forfeiture is demonstrated by the fact that the

First Congress enacted statutes requiring full forfeiture ofgoods involved in customs offenses or the payment of monetary penalties proportioned to the goods' value. It is arguedthat the enactment of these statutes at roughly the same
time that the Eighth Amendment was ratified suggests thatfull forfeiture, in the customs context at least, is a proportional punishment. The early customs statutes, however, donot support such a conclusion because, unlike $ 982(a)(1), the
type of forfeiture that they imposed was not considered pun-ishment for a criminal offense.

Certain of the early customs statutes required the forfeit-ure of goods imported in violation of the customs laws, and,
in some instances, the vessels carrying them as well. See,
e. g., Act of Aug. 4, 1790, $ 27, 1 Stat. 163 (goods unladenwithout a permit from the collector). These forfeitures,

however, were civil in rem forfeitures, in which the Govern-ment proceeded against the property itself on the theory
that it was guilty, not against a criminal defendant. See,
e. g., Harford v. United States, 8 Cranch 109 (1814) (goodsunladen without a permit); Locke v. United States, 7 Cranch

339, 340 (1813) (same). Such forfeitures sought to vindicatethe Government's underlying property right in customs duties, and like other traditional in rem forfeitures, they werenot considered at the founding to be punishment for an
offense. See supra, at 330-331. They therefore indicate

15 Respondent does not argue that his wealth or income are relevant to
the proportionality determination or that full forfeiture would deprive him
of his livelihood, see supra, at 335-336, and the District Court made no
factual findings in this respect.

Opinion of the Court
nothing about the proportionality of the punitive forfeitureat issue here. See supra, at 330-332.

16

Other statutes, however, imposed monetary "forfeitures"proportioned to the value of the goods involved. See, e. g.,

Act of July 31, 1789, $ 22, 1 Stat. 42 (if an importer, "withdesign to defraud the revenue," did not invoice his goods at
their actual cost at the place of export, "all such goods, waresor merchandise, or the value thereof . . . shall be forfeited");

$ 25, id., at 43 (any person concealing or purchasing goods,knowing they were liable to seizure for violation of the customs laws, was liable to "forfeit and pay a sum double thevalue of the goods so concealed or purchased"); see also Act
of Aug. 4, 1790, $$ 10, 14, 22, id., at 156, 158, 161. Similarstatutes were passed in later Congresses. See, e. g., Act of
Mar. 2, 1799, $$ 24, 28, 45, 46, 66, 69, 79, 84, id., at 646, 648,661, 662, 677, 678, 687, 694; Act of Mar. 3, 1823, ch. 58, $ 1, 3
Stat. 781.These "forfeitures" were similarly not considered punishments for criminal offenses. This Court so recognized in
Stockwell v. United States, 13 Wall. 531 (1871), a case interpreting a statute that, like the Act of July 31, 1789, provided
that a person who had concealed goods liable to seizure forcustoms violations should "forfeit and pay a sum double the

amount or value of the goods." Act of Mar. 3, 1823, ch. 58,$ 2, 3 Stat. 781-782. The

Stockwell Court rejected the de16 The nonpunitive nature of these early forfeitures was not lost on the
Department of Justice, in commenting on the punitive forfeiture provisions
of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970:

" `The concept of forfeiture as a criminal penalty which is embodied in
this provision differs from other presently existing forfeiture provisions
under Federal statutes where the proceeding is in rem against the property and the thing which is declared unlawful under the statute, or which
is used for an unlawful purpose, or in connection with the prohibited property or transaction, is considered the offender, and the forfeiture is no
part of the punishment for the criminal offense. Examples of such forfeiture provisions are those contained in the customs, narcotics, and revenue laws.' " S. Rep. No. 91-617, p. 79 (1969) (emphasis added).

Opinion of the Court
fendant's contention that this provision was "penal," statinginstead that it was "fully as remedial in its character, designed as plainly to secure [the] rights [of the Government],as are the statutes rendering importers liable to duties." 13
Wall., at 546. The Court reasoned:

"When foreign merchandise, subject to duties, is im-ported into the country, the act of importation imposes

on the importer the obligation to pay the legal charges.Besides this the goods themselves, if the duties be not
paid, are subject to seizure . . . . Every act, therefore,which interferes with the right of the government to
seize and appropriate the property which has been for-feited to it . . . is a wrong to property rights, and is a fit
subject for indemnity." Ibid.
Significantly, the fact that the forfeiture was a multiple ofthe value of the goods did not alter the Court's conclusion:

"The act of abstracting goods illegally imported, re-ceiving, concealing, or buying them, interposes difficulties in the way of a government seizure, and impairs,therefore, the value of the government right. It is,
then, hardly accurate to say that the only loss the gov-ernment can sustain from concealing the goods liable to
seizure is their single value . . . . Double the value maynot be more than complete indemnity." Id., at 546-547.

The early monetary forfeitures, therefore, were considerednot as punishment for an offense, but rather as serving the
remedial purpose of reimbursing the Government for thelosses accruing from the evasion of customs duties.

17 In each of the statutes from the early Congresses cited by the dissent,
the activities giving rise to the monetary forfeitures, if undetected, were
likely to cause the Government losses in customs revenue. The forfeiture
imposed by the Acts of Aug. 4, 1790, and Mar. 2, 1799, was not simply for
"transferring goods from one ship to another," post, at 346, but rather for
doing so "before such ship . . . shall come to the proper place for the
discharge of her cargo . . . and be there duly authorized by the proper
officer or officers of the customs to unlade" the goods, see 1 Stat. 157,

Opinion of the Court
were thus no different in purpose and effect than the in rem
forfeitures of the goods to whose value they were proportioned.18 Cf. One Lot Emerald Cut Stones v. United States,
409 U. S., at 237 (customs statute requiring the forfeiture of
undeclared goods concealed in baggage and imposing a monetary penalty equal to the value of the goods imposed a "remedial, rather than [a] punitive sanctio[n]").19 By contrast,

158, 648, whereupon duties would be assessed. Similarly, the forfeiture
imposed by the Act of Mar. 3, 1823, was for failing to deliver the ship's
manifest of cargo--which was to list "merchandise subject to duty"--to
the collector of customs. See Act of Mar. 2, 1821, $ 1, 3 Stat. 616; Act of
Mar. 3, 1823, $ 1, id., at 781. And the "invoices" that if "false" gave rise
to the forfeiture imposed by the Act of Mar. 3, 1863, were to include the
value or quantity of any dutiable goods. $ 1, 12 Stat. 737-738.

18 The nonpunitive nature of the monetary forfeitures was also reflected

in their procedure: like traditional in rem forfeitures, they were brought
as civil actions, and as such are distinguishable from the punitive criminal
fine at issue here. Instead of instituting an information of libel in rem
against the goods, see, e. g., Locke v. United States, 7 Cranch 339 (1813),
the Government filed "a civil action of debt" against the person from whom
it sought payment. See, e. g., Stockwell v. United States, 13 Wall. 531,
541-542 (1871). In both England and the United States, an action of debt
was used to recover import duties owed the Government, being "the general remedy for the recovery of all sums certain, whether the legal liability
arise from contract, or be created by a statute. And the remedy as well
lies for the government itself, as for a citizen." United States v. Lyman,
26 F. Cas. 1024, 1030 (No. 15,647) (CC Mass. 1818) (Story, C. J.). Thus
suits for the payment of monetary forfeitures were viewed no differently
than suits for the customs duties themselves.

19 One Lot Emerald Cut Stones differs from this case in the most fundamental respect. We concluded that the forfeiture provision in Emerald
Cut Stones was entirely remedial and thus nonpunitive, primarily because
it "provide[d] a reasonable form of liquidated damages" to the Government. 409 U. S., at 237. The additional fact that such a remedial forfeiture also "serves to reimburse the Government for investigation and enforcement expenses," ibid.; see post, at 346, is essentially meaningless,
because even a clearly punitive criminal fine or forfeiture could be said in
some measure to reimburse for criminal enforcement and investigation.
Contrary to the dissent's assertion, this certainly does not mean that the
forfeiture in this case--which, as the dissent acknowledges, see post, at
344 (respondent's forfeiture is a "fine"); post, at 353 ($ 982(a)(1) imposes a

Kennedy, J., dissenting
the full forfeiture mandated by $ 982(a)(1) in this case servesno remedial purpose; it is clearly punishment. The customs

statutes enacted by the First Congress, therefore, in no waysuggest that $ 982(a)(1)'s currency forfeiture is constitutionally proportional. * * *

For the foregoing reasons, the full forfeiture of respond-ent's currency would violate the Excessive Fines Clause.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is

Affirmed.

Justice Kennedy, with whom The Chief Justice, Justice O'Connor, and Justice Scalia join, dissenting.

For the first time in its history, the Court strikes down afine as excessive under the Eighth Amendment. The decision is disturbing both for its specific holding and for thebroader upheaval it foreshadows. At issue is a fine Congress fixed in the amount of the currency respondent soughtto smuggle or to transport without reporting. If a fine calibrated with this accuracy fails the Court's test, its decisionportends serious disruption of a vast range of statutory fines.
The Court all but says the offense is not serious anyway.This disdain for the statute is wrong as an empirical matter
and disrespectful of the separation of powers. The irony ofthe case is that, in the end, it may stand for narrowing constitutional protection rather than enhancing it. To make itsrationale work, the Court appears to remove important
classes of fines from any excessiveness inquiry at all. This,too, is unsound; and with all respect, I dissent.

harm suffered. Remedial penalties, the Court holds, are notsubject to the Excessive Fines Clause at all. See,

e. g., ante,
at 342. Proceeding from this premise, the majority holdscustoms fines are remedial and not at all punitive, even if

they amount to many times the duties due on the goods.
See ante, at 341-344. In the majority's universe, a fine isnot a punishment even if it is much larger than the money

owed. This confuses whether a fine is excessive withwhether it is a punishment.

This novel, mistaken approach requires reordering a tradi-tion existing long before the Republic and confirmed in its
early years. The Court creates its category to reconcile its
unprecedented holding with a six-century-long tradition of
in personam customs fines equal to one, two, three, or even
four times the value of the goods at issue. E. g., Cross v.

Rich. 2, Stat. 1, chs. 2, 3 (1381) (Eng.) (exporting gold orsilver without a license; using ships other than those of the
King's allegiance).

In order to sweep all these precedents aside, the majority'sremedial analysis assumes the settled tradition was limited

to "reimbursing the Government for" unpaid duties. Ante,at 342. The assumption is wrong. Many offenses did not
require a failure to pay a duty at all. See, e. g., Act of Mar.3, 1863, $ 1, 12 Stat. 738 (importing under false invoices); Act
of Mar. 3, 1823, ch. 58, $ 1, 3 Stat. 781 (failing to deliver ship's
manifest); Act of Mar. 2, 1799, $ 28, 1 Stat. 648 (transferring
goods from one ship to another); Act of Aug. 4, 1790, $ 14, 1
Stat. 158 (same); 5 Rich. II, st. 1, ch. 2 (1381) (Eng.) (exporting gold or silver without a license). None of these in personam penalties depended on a compensable monetary loss to
the Government. True, these offenses risked causing harm,
ante, at 342-343, n. 17, but so does smuggling or not reporting cash. A sanction proportioned to potential rather than
actual harm is punitive, though the potential harm may make
the punishment a reasonable one. See TXO Production
Corp. v. Alliance Resources Corp., 509 U. S. 443, 460-462
(1993) (opinion of Stevens, J.). The majority nonetheless
treats the historic penalties as nonpunitive and thus not subject to the Excessive Fines Clause, though they are indistinguishable from the fine in this case. (It is a mark of the
Court's doctrinal difficulty that we must speak of nonpunitive penalties, which is a contradiction in terms.)

Even if the majority's typology were correct, it would have
to treat the instant penalty as nonpunitive. In this respect,
the Court cannot distinguish the case on which it twice relies, One Lot Emerald Cut Stones v. United States, 409 U. S.
232 (1972) (per curiam). Ante, at 329, 343. Emerald
Stones held forfeiture of smuggled goods plus a fine equal to
their value was remedial and not punitive, for purposes of

Kennedy, J., dissenting
double jeopardy, because the fine "serves to reimburse theGovernment for investigation and enforcement expenses."

409 U. S., at 237. The logic, however, applies with equalforce here. Forfeiture of the money involved in the offense
would compensate for the investigative and enforcement ex-penses of the Customs Service. There is no reason to treat
the cases differently, just because a small duty was at stakein one and a disclosure form in the other. See

Bollinger'sChampagne, 3 Wall. 560, 564 (1866) (holding falsehoods on

customs forms justify forfeiture even if the lies do not affectthe duties due and paid). The majority, in short, is not even
faithful to its own artificial category of remedial penalties.

B
The majority's novel holding creates another anomaly aswell. The majority suggests

in rem forfeitures of the in-strumentalities of crimes are not fines at all. See

ante, at333-334, and nn. 8, 9. The point of the instrumentality theory is to distinguish goods having a "close enough relation-ship to the offense" from those incidentally related to it.
Austin v. United States, 509 U. S. 602, 628 (1993) (Scalia, J.,concurring in part and concurring in judgment). From this,
the Court concludes the money in a cash-smuggling or nonre-porting offense cannot be an instrumentality, unlike, say, a
car used to transport goods concealed from taxes. Ante, at334, n. 9. There is little logic in this rationale. The car
plays an important role in the offense but is not essential;one could also transport goods by jet or by foot. The link
between the cash and the cash-smuggling offense is closer,as the offender must fail to report while smuggling more
than $10,000. See 31 U. S. C. $$ 5316(a), 5322(a). The cashis not just incidentally related to the offense of cash smuggling. It is essential, whereas the car is not. Yet the carplays an important enough role to justify forfeiture, as the
majority concedes. A fortiori, the cash does as well. Evenif there were a clear distinction between instrumentalities

and incidental objects, when the Court invokes the distinc-tion it gets the results backwards.

II
Turning to the question of excessiveness, the majoritystates the test: A defendant must prove a gross disproportion before a court will strike down a fine as excessive. See
ante, at 334. This test would be a proper way to apply theClause, if only the majority were faithful in applying it. The

Court does not, however, explain why in this case forfeitureof all of the cash would have suffered from a gross disproportion. The offense is a serious one, and respondent's smug-gling and failing to report were willful. The cash was lawful
to own, but this fact shows only that the forfeiture was afine; it cannot also prove that the fine was excessive.

The majority illuminates its test with a principle of defer-ence. Courts " `should grant substantial deference to the
broad authority that legislatures necessarily possess' " insetting punishments.

Ante, at 336 (quoting Solem v. Helm,463 U. S. 277, 290 (1983)). Again, the principle is sound

but the implementation is not. The majority's assessmentof the crime accords no deference, let alone substantial
deference, to the judgment of Congress. Congress deemsthe crime serious, but the Court does not. Under the congressional statute, the crime is punishable by a prison sen-tence, a heavy fine, and the forfeiture here at issue. As the
statute makes clear, the Government needs the informationto investigate other serious crimes, and it needs the penalties
to ensure compliance. A

By affirming, the majority in effect approves a meager$15,000 forfeiture. The majority's holding purports to be
narrower, saying only that forfeiture of the entire $357,144would be excessive. Ante, at 337, and n. 11. This narrow
holding is artificial in constricting the question presentedfor this Court's review. The statute mandates forfeiture of

524US2 Unit: $U89 [09-11-00 13:24:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Kennedy, J., dissenting
the entire $357,144. See 18 U. S. C. $ 982(a)(1). The onlyground for reducing the forfeiture, then, is that any higher

amount would be unconstitutional. The majority affirms thereduced $15,000 forfeiture on

de novo review, see ante, at
336-337, and n. 11, which it can do only if a forfeiture of
even $15,001 would have suffered from a gross disproportion.Indeed, the majority leaves open whether the $15,000 forfeiture itself was too great. See ante, at 337, n. 11. Moneylaunderers, among the principal targets of this statute, may
get an even greater return from their crime.The majority does not explain why respondent's knowing,
willful, serious crime deserves no higher penalty than
$15,000. It gives only a cursory explanation of why forfeiture of all of the money would have suffered from a gross
disproportion. The majority justifies its evisceration of the
fine because the money was legal to have and came from a
legal source. See ante, at 337-338. This fact, however,
shows only that the forfeiture was a fine, not that it was
excessive. As the majority puts it, respondent's money was
lawful to possess, was acquired in a lawful manner, and was
lawful to export. Ibid. It was not, however, lawful to possess the money while concealing and smuggling it. Even if
one overlooks this problem, the apparent lawfulness of the
money adds nothing to the argument. If the items possessed had been dangerous or unlawful to own, for instance,
narcotics, the forfeiture would have been remedial and would
not have been a fine at all. See Austin, supra, at 621; e. g.,
United States v. One Assortment of 89 Firearms, 465 U. S.
354, 364 (1984) (unlicensed guns); Commonwealth v. Dana,
43 Mass. 329, 337 (1841) (forbidden lottery tickets). If respondent had acquired the money in an unlawful manner, it
would have been forfeitable as proceeds of the crime. As a
rule, forfeitures of criminal proceeds serve the nonpunitive
ends of making restitution to the rightful owners and of
compelling the surrender of property held without right or
ownership. See United States v. Ursery, 518 U. S. 267, 284

(1996). Most forfeitures of proceeds, as a consequence, arenot fines at all, let alone excessive fines. Hence, the lawfulness of the money shows at most that the forfeiture was afine; it cannot at the same time prove that the fine was
excessive. B

In assessing whether there is a gross disproportion, themajority concedes, we must grant " `substantial deference' "

to Congress' choice of penalties. Ante, at 336 (quotingSolem, supra, at 290). Yet, ignoring its own command, the
Court sweeps aside Congress' reasoned judgment and substi-tutes arguments that are little more than speculation.

Congress considered currency smuggling and nonre-porting a serious crime and imposed commensurate penalties. It authorized punishments of five years' imprison-ment, a $250,000 fine, plus forfeiture of all the undeclared
cash. 31 U. S. C. $ 5322(a); 18 U. S. C. $ 982(a)(1). Congressfound the offense standing alone is a serious crime, for the
same statute doubles the fines and imprisonment for failuresto report cash "while violating another law of the United
States. " 31 U. S. C. $ 5322(b). Congress experimentedwith lower penalties on the order of one year in prison plus a
$1,000 fine, but it found the punishments inadequate to deterlucrative money laundering. See President's Commission on
Organized Crime, The Cash Connection: Organized Crime,Financial Institutions, and Money Laundering 27, 60 (Oct.
1984). The Court today rejects this judgment.The Court rejects the congressional judgment because, it
says, the Sentencing Guidelines cap the appropriate fine at$5,000. See

ante, at 338-339, and n. 14. The purpose of theGuidelines, however, is to select punishments with precise

proportion, not to opine on what is a gross disproportion. Inaddition, there is no authority for elevating the Commission's
judgment of what is prudent over the congressional judg524US2 Unit: $U89 [09-11-00 13:24:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Kennedy, J., dissenting
ment of what is constitutional. The majority, then, departsfrom its promise of deference in the very case announcing

the standard.The Court's argument is flawed, moreover, by a serious
misinterpretation of the Guidelines on their face. TheGuidelines do not stop at the $5,000 fine the majority cites.
They augment it with this vital point: "Forfeiture is to beimposed upon a convicted defendant as provided by statute."
United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual$ 5E1.4 (Nov. 1995). The fine thus supplements the forfeiture; it does not replace it. Far from contradicting congres-sional judgment on the offense, the Guidelines implement
and mandate it. 2

The crime of smuggling or failing to report cash is moreserious than the Court is willing to acknowledge. The drug
trade, money laundering, and tax evasion all depend in parton smuggled and unreported cash. Congress enacted the
reporting requirement because secret exports of money werebeing used in organized crime, drug trafficking, money
laundering, and other crimes. See H. R. Rep. No. 91-975,pp. 12-13 (1970). Likewise, tax evaders were using cash
exports to dodge hundreds of millions of dollars in taxesowed to the Government. See

ibid.The Court does not deny the importance of these interests

but claims they are not implicated here because respondentmanaged to disprove any link to other crimes. Here, to be
sure, the Government had no affirmative proof that themoney was from an illegal source or for an illegal purpose.
This will often be the case, however. By its very nature,
money laundering is difficult to prove; for if the money laun-derers have done their job, the money appears to be clean.

The point of the statute, which provides for even heavierpenalties if a second crime can be proved, is to mandate
forfeiture regardless. See 31 U. S. C. $ 5322(b); 18 U. S. C.

$ 982(a)(1). It is common practice, of course, for a cash cou-rier not to confess a tainted source but to stick to a wellrehearsed story. The kingpin, the real owner, need notcome forward to make a legal claim to the funds. He has
his own effective enforcement measures to ensure delivery
at destination or return at origin if the scheme is thwarted.He is, of course, not above punishing the courier who deviates from the story and informs. The majority is wrong,then, to assume

in personam forfeitures cannot affect kingpins, as their couriers will claim to own the money and paythe penalty out of their masters' funds. See

ante, at 328,
n. 3. Even if the courier confessed, the kingpin could face
an in personam forfeiture for his agent's authorized acts, for
the kingpin would be a co-principal in the commission of the
crime. See 18 U. S. C. $ 2.

In my view, forfeiture of all the unreported currency is
sustainable whenever a willful violation is proved. The
facts of this case exemplify how hard it can be to prove ownership and other crimes, and they also show respondent is
far from an innocent victim. For one thing, he was guilty
of repeated lies to Government agents and suborning lies by
others. Customs inspectors told respondent of his duty to
report cash. He and his wife claimed they had only $15,000
with them, not the $357,144 they in fact had concealed. He
then told customs inspectors a friend named Abe Ajemian
had lent him about $200,000. Ajemian denied this. A
month later, respondent said Saeed Faroutan had lent him
$170,000. Faroutan, however, said he had not made the loan
and respondent had asked him to lie. Six months later, respondent resurrected the fable of the alleged loan from
Ajemian, though Ajemian had already contradicted the
story. As the District Court found, respondent "has lied,
and has had his friends lie." Tr. 54 (Jan. 19, 1995). He had
proffered a "suspicious and confused story, documented in
the poorest way, and replete with past misrepresentation."

Respondent told these lies, moreover, in most suspiciouscircumstances. His luggage was stuffed with more than a

third of a million dollars. All of it was in cash, and much ofit was hidden in a case with a false bottom.

The majority ratifies the District Court's see-no-evil approach. The District Court ignored respondent's lies inassessing a sentence. It gave him a two-level downward

adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, instead of anincrease for obstruction of justice. See

id., at 62. It dismissed the lies as stemming from "distrust for the Gov-ernment" arising out of "cultural differences."

Id., at 63.
While the majority is sincere in not endorsing this excuse,
ante, at 337-338, n. 12, it nonetheless affirms the fine tainted
by it. This patronizing excuse demeans millions of lawabiding American immigrants by suggesting they cannot be
expected to be as truthful as every other citizen. Each
American, regardless of culture or ethnicity, is equal before
the law. Each has the same obligation to refrain from perjury and false statements to the Government.

In short, respondent was unable to give a single truthful
explanation of the source of the cash. The multitude of lies
and suspicious circumstances points to some form of crime.
Yet, though the Government rebutted each and every fable
respondent proffered, it was unable to adduce affirmative
proof of another crime in this particular case.

Because of the problems of individual proof, Congress
found it necessary to enact a blanket punishment. See
S. Rep. No. 99-130, p. 21 (1985); see also Drug Money Laundering Control Efforts, Hearing before the Subcommittee on
Consumer and Regulatory Affairs of the Senate Banking,
Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, 101st Cong., 1st
Sess., 84 (1989) (former Internal Revenue Service agent
found it " `unbelievably difficult' " to discern which money
flows were legitimate and which were tied to crime). One
of the few reliable warning signs of some serious crimes is
the use of large sums of cash. See id., at 83. So Congress

Kennedy, J., dissenting
punished all cash smuggling or nonreporting, authorizingsingle penalties for the offense alone and double penalties for

the offense coupled with proof of other crimes. See 31U. S. C. $$ 5322(a), (b). The requirement of willfulness, it
judged, would be enough to protect the innocent. See ibid.The majority second-guesses this judgment without explaining why Congress' blanket approach was unreasonable.Money launderers will rejoice to know they face forfeitures of less than 5% of the money transported, provided theyhire accomplished liars to carry their money for them. Five
percent, of course, is not much of a deterrent or punishment;it is comparable to the fee one might pay for a mortgage
lender or broker. Cf. 15 U. S. C. $ 1602(aa)(1)(B) (high-costmortgages cost more than 8% in points and fees). It is far
less than the 20%-26% commissions some drug dealers paymoney launderers. See Hearing on Money Laundering and
the Drug Trade before the Subcommittee on Crime of theHouse Judiciary Committee, 105th Cong., 1st Sess., 62 (1997)
(testimony of M. Zeldin); Andelman, The Drug Money Maze,73 Foreign Affairs 108 (July/Aug. 1994). Since many couriers evade detection, moreover, the average forfeiture perdollar smuggled could amount, courtesy of today's decision,
to far less than 5%. In any event, the fine permitted bythe majority would be a modest cost of doing business in
the world of drugs and crime. See US/Mexico Bi-NationalDrug Threat Assessment 84 (Feb. 1997) (to drug dealers,
transaction costs of 13%-15% are insignificant compared totheir enormous profit margins).

Given the severity of respondent's crime, the Constitutiondoes not forbid forfeiture of all of the smuggled or unreported cash. Congress made a considered judgment in set-ting the penalty, and the Court is in serious error to set
it aside. III

The Court's holding may in the long run undermine thepurpose of the Excessive Fines Clause. One of the main

purposes of the ban on excessive fines was to prevent theKing from assessing unpayable fines to keep his enemies in

debtor's prison. See Browning-Ferris Industries of Vt.,Inc. v. Kelco Disposal, Inc., 492 U. S. 257, 267 (1989); 4 W.
Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 373(1769) ("[C]orporal punishment, or a stated imprisonment,
. . . is better than an excessive fine, for that amounts to im-prisonment for life. And this is the reason why fines in the
king's court are frequently denominated ransoms . . .").Concern with imprisonment may explain why the Excessive
Fines Clause is coupled with, and follows right after, theExcessive Bail Clause. While the concern is not implicated
here--for of necessity the money is there to satisfy the for-feiture--the Court's restrictive approach could subvert this
purpose. Under the Court's holding, legislators may rely onmandatory prison sentences in lieu of fines. Drug lords will
be heartened by this, knowing the prison terms will fall upontheir couriers while leaving their own wallets untouched.

At the very least, today's decision will encourage legisla-tures to take advantage of another avenue the majority
leaves open. The majority subjects this forfeiture to scru-tiny because it is

in personam, but it then suggests most inrem forfeitures (and perhaps most civil forfeitures) may not

be fines at all. Ante, at 331, 340-341, and n. 16; but see ante,at 331, n. 6. The suggestion, one might note, is inconsistent
or at least in tension with Austin v. United States, 509 U. S.602 (1993). In any event, these remarks may encourage a
legislative shift from in personam to in rem forfeitures,avoiding

mens rea as a predicate and giving owners fewerprocedural protections. By invoking the Excessive Fines

Clause with excessive zeal, the majority may in the long runencourage Congress to circumvent it.

the Constitution. Nonremedial fines may be subject to def-erence in theory but overbearing scrutiny in fact. So-called

remedial penalties, most in rem forfeitures, and perhaps civilfines may not be subject to scrutiny at all. I would not create these exemptions from the Excessive Fines Clause. Iwould also accord genuine deference to Congress' judgments
about the gravity of the offenses it creates. I would furtherfollow the long tradition of fines calibrated to the value of
the goods smuggled. In these circumstances, the Constitu-tion does not forbid forfeiture of all of the $357,144 transported by respondent. I dissent.

PENNSYLVANIA BOARD OF PROBATION ANDPAROLE

v. SCOTT

certiorari to the supreme court of pennsylvania

No. 97-581. Argued March 30, 1998--Decided June 22, 1998
A condition of respondent's Pennsylvania parole was that he refrain from

owning or possessing weapons. Based on evidence that he had violated
this and other such conditions, parole officers entered his home and
found firearms, a bow, and arrows. At his parole violation hearing, respondent objected to the introduction of this evidence on the ground
that the search was unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment. The
hearing examiner rejected the challenge and admitted the evidence.
As a result, petitioner parole board found sufficient evidence to support
the charges and recommitted respondent. The Commonwealth Court
of Pennsylvania reversed, and the Pennsylvania Supreme Court affirmed
the reversal, holding, inter alia, that although the federal exclusionary
rule, which prohibits the introduction at criminal trial of evidence obtained in violation of a defendant's Fourth Amendment rights, does not
generally apply in parole revocation hearings, it applied in this case
because the officers who conducted the search were aware of respondent's parole status. The court reasoned that, otherwise, illegal searches
would be undeterred when officers know that their subjects are parolees and that illegally obtained evidence can be introduced at parole
hearings.

Held: The federal exclusionary rule does not bar the introduction at

parole revocation hearings of evidence seized in violation of parolees'
Fourth Amendment rights. The State's use of such evidence does not
itself violate the Constitution. See, e. g., United States v. Leon, 468
U. S. 897, 906. Rather, a violation is "fully accomplished" by the illegal
search or seizure, and no exclusion of evidence can cure the invasion
of rights the defendant has already suffered. E. g., id., at 906. The
exclusionary rule is instead a judicially created means of deterring illegal searches and seizures. United States v. Calandra, 414 U. S. 338,
348. As such, it does not proscribe the introduction of illegally seized
evidence in all proceedings or against all persons, Stone v. Powell, 428
U. S. 465, 486, but applies only in contexts where its remedial objectives
are thought most efficaciously served, e. g., Calandra, supra, at 348.
Moreover, because the rule is prudential rather than constitutionally
mandated, it applies only where its deterrence benefits outweigh the
substantial social costs inherent in precluding consideration of reliable,

probative evidence. Leon, 468 U. S., at 907. Recognizing these costs,
the Court has repeatedly declined to extend the rule to proceedings
other than criminal trials. E. g., id., at 909. It again declines to do so
here. The social costs of allowing convicted criminals who violate their
parole to remain at large are particularly high, see Morrissey v. Brewer,
408 U. S. 471, 477, 483, and are compounded by the fact that parolees
(particularly those who have already committed parole violations) are
more likely to commit future crimes than are average citizens, see Griffin v. Wisconsin, 483 U. S. 868, 880. Application of the exclusionary
rule, moreover, would be incompatible with the traditionally flexible,
nonadversarial, administrative procedures of parole revocation, see
Morrissey, supra, at 480, 489, in that it would require extensive litigation to determine whether particular evidence must be excluded,
cf., e. g., Calandra, supra, at 349. The rule would provide only minimal
deterrence benefits in this context, because its application in criminal trials already provides significant deterrence of unconstitutional
searches. Cf. United States v. Janis, 428 U. S. 433, 448, 454. The
Pennsylvania Supreme Court's special rule for situations in which the
searching officer knows his subject is a parolee is rejected because this
Court has never suggested that the exclusionary rule must apply in
every circumstance in which it might provide marginal deterrence, e. g.,
Calandra, supra, at 350; because such a piecemeal approach would add
an additional layer of collateral litigation regarding the officer's knowledge of the parolee's status; and because, in any event, any additional
deterrence would be minimal, whether the person conducting the search
was a police officer or a parole officer. Pp. 362-369.

term of 10 to 20 years, beginning on March 31, 1983. OnSeptember 1, 1993, just months after completing the minimum sentence, respondent was released on parole. One ofthe conditions of respondent's parole was that he would refrain from "owning or possessing any firearms or other weapons." App. 5a. The parole agreement, which respondentsigned, further provided:

"I expressly consent to the search of my person, property and residence, without a warrant by agents of thePennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole. Any

items, in [sic] the possession of which constitutes a violation of parole/reparole shall be subject to seizure, andmay be used as evidence in the parole revocation process." Id., at 7a.
About five months later, after obtaining an arrest warrant
based on evidence that respondent had violated several con-ditions of his parole by possessing firearms, consuming alcohol, and assaulting a co-worker, three parole officers arrestedrespondent at a local diner. Before being transferred to a
correctional facility, respondent gave the officers the keysto his residence. The officers entered the home, which was
owned by his mother, but did not perform a search for paroleviolations until respondent's mother arrived. The officers
neither requested nor obtained consent to perform the
search, but respondent's mother did direct them to his bed-room. After finding no relevant evidence there, the officers

searched an adjacent sitting room in which they found fivefirearms, a compound bow, and three arrows.

At his parole violation hearing, respondent objected to the
introduction of the evidence obtained during the search of
his home on the ground that the search was unreasonable
under the Fourth Amendment. The hearing examiner, however, rejected the challenge and admitted the evidence. As
a result, the Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole
found sufficient evidence in the record to support the weap524US2 Unit: $U90 [09-15-00 14:33:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ons and alcohol charges and recommitted respondent to
serve 36 months' backtime.

The Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania reversed and
remanded, holding, inter alia, that the hearing examiner had
erred in admitting the evidence obtained during the search
of respondent's residence.1 The court ruled that the search
violated respondent's Fourth Amendment rights because it
was conducted without the owner's consent and was not
authorized by any state statutory or regulatory framework
ensuring the reasonableness of searches by parole officers.
668 A. 2d 590, 596 (1995). The court further held that the
exclusionary rule should apply because, in the circumstances
of respondent's case, the deterrence benefits of the rule outweighed its costs. Id., at 600.2

The Pennsylvania Supreme Court affirmed. 548 Pa. 418,
698 A. 2d 32 (1997). The court stated that respondent's
Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable searches and
seizures was "unaffected" by his signing of the parole agreement giving parole officers permission to conduct warrantless searches. Id., at 427, 698 A. 2d, at 36. It then held
that the search in question was unreasonable because it was
supported only by "mere speculation" rather than a "reasonable suspicion" of a parole violation. Ibid. Carving out an
exception to its per se bar against application of the exclusionary rule in parole revocation hearings, see Commonwealth v. Kates, 452 Pa. 102, 120, 305 A. 2d 701, 710 (1973),
the court further ruled that the federal exclusionary rule
applied to this case because the officers who conducted the

admitting hearsay evidence regarding alcohol consumption and a separate
incident of weapons possession.

Commonwealth Court filed an en banc opinion in another case that overruled its decision in respondent's case and held that the exclusionary rule
does not apply in parole revocation hearings. Kyte v. Pennsylvania Bd.

Amendment exclusionary rule applies to parole revocationproceedings. 522 U. S. 992 (1997).

We have emphasized repeatedly that the government's useof evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment

does not itself violate the Constitution. See, e. g., UnitedStates v. Leon, 468 U. S. 897, 906 (1984); Stone v. Powell, 428
U. S. 465, 482, 486 (1976). Rather, a Fourth Amendmentviolation is " `fully accomplished' " by the illegal search or
seizure, and no exclusion of evidence from a judicial or admin-istrative proceeding can " `cure the invasion of the defendant's
rights which he has already suffered.' " United States v.
Leon, supra, at 906 (quoting Stone v. Powell, supra, at 540

3 We also invited the parties to brief the question whether a search of a
parolee's residence must be based on reasonable suspicion where the parolee has consented to searches as a condition of parole. Respondent argues that we lack jurisdiction to decide this question in this case because
the Pennsylvania Supreme Court held, as a matter of Pennsylvania law,
that respondent's consent to warrantless searches as a condition of his
state parole did not constitute consent to searches that are unreasonable
under the Fourth Amendment. Petitioner and its amici contend that the
Pennsylvania Supreme Court's opinion was at least ambiguous as to
whether it relied on state or federal law to determine the extent of respondent's consent, and that we therefore have jurisdiction under Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 1032 (1983). We need not parse the Pennsylvania
Supreme Court's decision in an attempt to discern its intent, however,
because it is clear that we have jurisdiction to determine whether the
exclusionary rule applies to state parole revocation proceedings, and our
decision on that issue is sufficient to decide the case. We therefore
express no opinion regarding the constitutionality of the search.

Opinion of the Court
(White, J., dissenting)). The exclusionary rule is instead ajudicially created means of deterring illegal searches and seizures. United States v. Calandra, 414 U. S. 338, 348 (1974).As such, the rule does not "proscribe the introduction of
illegally seized evidence in all proceedings or against all
persons," Stone v. Powell, supra, at 486, but applies only incontexts "where its remedial objectives are thought most

efficaciously served," United States v. Calandra, supra, at348; see also

United States v. Janis, 428 U. S. 433, 454 (1976)
("If . . . the exclusionary rule does not result in appreciabledeterrence, then, clearly, its use in the instant situation is

unwarranted"). Moreover, because the rule is prudential
rather than constitutionally mandated, we have held it to be
applicable only where its deterrence benefits outweigh its
"substantial social costs." United States v. Leon, 468 U. S.,
at 907.

Recognizing these costs, we have repeatedly declined to
extend the exclusionary rule to proceedings other than criminal trials. Id., at 909; United States v. Janis, supra, at 447.
For example, in United States v. Calandra, we held that the
exclusionary rule does not apply to grand jury proceedings;
in so doing, we emphasized that such proceedings play a special role in the law enforcement process and that the traditionally flexible, nonadversarial nature of those proceedings
would be jeopardized by application of the rule. 414 U. S.,
at 343-346, 349-350. Likewise, in United States v. Janis,
we held that the exclusionary rule did not bar the introduction of unconstitutionally obtained evidence in a civil tax proceeding because the costs of excluding relevant and reliable
evidence would outweigh the marginal deterrence benefits,
which, we noted, would be minimal because the use of the
exclusionary rule in criminal trials already deterred illegal
searches. 428 U. S., at 448, 454. Finally, in INS v. LopezMendoza, 468 U. S. 1032 (1984), we refused to extend the
exclusionary rule to civil deportation proceedings, citing the
high social costs of allowing an immigrant to remain illegally

in this country and noting the incompatibility of the rulewith the civil, administrative nature of those proceedings.

Id., at 1050.As in Calandra, Janis, and Lopez-Mendoza, we are asked
to extend the operation of the exclusionary rule beyond thecriminal trial context. We again decline to do so. Application of the exclusionary rule would both hinder the function-ing of state parole systems and alter the traditionally flexible, administrative nature of parole revocation proceedings.The rule would provide only minimal deterrence benefits in
this context, because application of the rule in the criminaltrial context already provides significant deterrence of unconstitutional searches. We therefore hold that the federalexclusionary rule does not bar the introduction at parole revocation hearings of evidence seized in violation of parolees'Fourth Amendment rights.

Because the exclusionary rule precludes consideration ofreliable, probative evidence, it imposes significant costs: It
undeniably detracts from the truthfinding process and allows
many who would otherwise be incarcerated to escape theconsequences of their actions. See

Stone v. Powell, supra,
at 490. Although we have held these costs to be worth bear-ing in certain circumstances,

4 our cases have repeatedly emphasized that the rule's "costly toll" upon truth-seeking and
law enforcement objectives presents a high obstacle for those

4 As discussed above, we have generally held the exclusionary rule to
apply only in criminal trials. We have, moreover, significantly limited its
application even in that context. For example, we have held that the rule
does not apply when the officer reasonably relied on a search warrant that
was later deemed invalid, United States v. Leon, 468 U. S. 897, 920-922
(1984); when the officer reasonably relied on a statute later deemed unconstitutional, Illinois v. Krull, 480 U. S. 340, 349-350 (1987); when the defendant seeks to assert another person's Fourth Amendment rights, Alderman v. United States, 394 U. S. 165, 174-175 (1969); and when the illegally
obtained evidence is used to impeach a defendant's testimony, United
States v. Havens, 446 U. S. 620, 627-628 (1980); Walder v. United States,
347 U. S. 62, 65 (1954).

urging application of the rule. United States v. Payner, 447U. S. 727, 734 (1980).

The costs of excluding reliable, probative evidence are par-ticularly high in the context of parole revocation proceedings. Parole is a "variation on imprisonment of convictedcriminals,"

Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U. S. 471, 477 (1972), inwhich the State accords a limited degree of freedom in return for the parolee's assurance that he will comply with theoften strict terms and conditions of his release. In most
cases, the State is willing to extend parole only because it isable to condition it upon compliance with certain requirements. The State thus has an "overwhelming interest" inensuring that a parolee complies with those requirements
and is returned to prison if he fails to do so. Id., at 483.The exclusion of evidence establishing a parole violation,
however, hampers the State's ability to ensure compliancewith these conditions by permitting the parolee to avoid the
consequences of his noncompliance. The costs of allowing aparolee to avoid the consequences of his violation are compounded by the fact that parolees (particularly those whohave already committed parole violations) are more likely to
commit future criminal offenses than are average citizens.See Griffin v. Wisconsin, 483 U. S. 868, 880 (1987). Indeed,
this is the very premise behind the system of close parolesupervision. Ibid.

The exclusionary rule, moreover, is incompatible with thetraditionally flexible, administrative procedures of parole
revocation. Because parole revocation deprives the paroleenot "of the absolute liberty to which every citizen is entitled,
but only of the conditional liberty properly dependent on ob-servance of special parole restrictions,"

Morrissey v. Brewer,supra, at 480, States have wide latitude under the Constitution to structure parole revocation proceedings.5 Most

Opinion of the Court

States, including Pennsylvania, see 548 Pa., at 427-428, 698A. 2d, at 36; Rivenbark v. Pennsylvania Bd. of Probation

and Parole, 509 Pa. 248, 501 A. 2d 1110 (1985), have adoptedinformal, administrative parole revocation procedures in
order to accommodate the large number of parole proceed-ings. These proceedings generally are not conducted by
judges, but instead by parole boards, "members of whichneed not be judicial officers or lawyers."

Morrissey v.Brewer, 408 U. S., at 489. And traditional rules of evidence

generally do not apply. Ibid. ("[T]he process should beflexible enough to consider evidence including letters, affidavits, and other material that would not be admissible in anadversary criminal trial"). Nor are these proceedings entirely adversarial, as they are designed to be " `predictiveand discretionary' as well as factfinding."

Gagnon v. Scar-pelli, 411 U. S. 778, 787 (1973) (quoting Morrissey v. Brewer,

supra, at 480).Application of the exclusionary rule would significantly
alter this process. The exclusionary rule frequently re-quires extensive litigation to determine whether particular
evidence must be excluded. Cf. United States v. Calandra,414 U. S., at 349 (noting that application of the exclusionary
rule "would delay and disrupt grand jury proceedings" be-cause "[s]uppression hearings would halt the orderly process
of an investigation and might necessitate extended litigationof issues only tangentially related to the grand jury's primary objective"); INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, 468 U. S., at 1048(noting that "[t]he prospect of even occasional invocation of
the exclusionary rule might significantly change and compli-cate the character of " the deportation system). Such litigation is inconsistent with the nonadversarial, administrativeprocesses established by the States. Although States could
adapt their parole revocation proceedings to accommodate
does not attach to such proceedings because the introduction of counsel
would "alter significantly the nature of the proceeding," Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U. S. 778, 787 (1973).

Opinion of the Court
such litigation, such a change would transform those pro-ceedings from a "predictive and discretionary" effort to promote the best interests of both parolees and society intotrial-like proceedings "less attuned" to the interests of the
parolee. Gagnon v. Scarpelli, supra, at 787-788 (quoting
Morrissey v. Brewer, supra, at 480). We are simply unwill-ing so to intrude into the States' correctional schemes. See

Morrissey v. Brewer, supra, at 483 (recognizing that Stateshave an "overwhelming interest" in maintaining informal,
administrative parole revocation procedures). Such a trans-formation ultimately might disadvantage parolees because
in an adversarial proceeding, "the hearing body may be less
tolerant of marginal deviant behavior and feel more pressure
to reincarcerate than to continue nonpunitive rehabilitation."
Gagnon v. Scarpelli, supra, at 788. And the financial costs
of such a system could reduce the State's incentive to extend
parole in the first place, as one of the purposes of parole is
to reduce the costs of criminal punishment while maintaining
a degree of supervision over the parolee.

The deterrence benefits of the exclusionary rule would not
outweigh these costs. As the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania recognized, application of the exclusionary rule to parole
revocation proceedings would have little deterrent effect
upon an officer who is unaware that the subject of his search
is a parolee. 548 Pa., at 431, 698 A. 2d, at 38. In that situation, the officer will likely be searching for evidence of criminal conduct with an eye toward the introduction of the
evidence at a criminal trial. The likelihood that illegally obtained evidence will be excluded from trial provides deterrence against Fourth Amendment violations, and the remote
possibility that the subject is a parolee and that the evidence
may be admitted at a parole revocation proceeding surely
has little, if any, effect on the officer's incentives. Cf. United
States v. Janis, 428 U. S., at 448.

The Pennsylvania Supreme Court thus fashioned a special
rule for those situations in which the officer performing the

524US2 Unit: $U90 [09-15-00 14:33:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN
368 PENNSYLVANIA BD. OF PROBATION

AND PAROLE v. SCOTT

Opinion of the Court

search knows that the subject of his search is a parolee. Wedecline to adopt such an approach. We have never suggested that the exclusionary rule must apply in every cir-cumstance in which it might provide marginal deterrence.
United States v. Calandra, supra, at 350; Alderman v.
United States, 394 U. S. 165, 174 (1969). Furthermore, sucha piecemeal approach to the exclusionary rule would add an

additional layer of collateral litigation regarding the officer'sknowledge of the parolee's status.

In any event, any additional deterrence from the Pennsyl-vania Supreme Court's rule would be minimal. Where the
person conducting the search is a police officer, the officer's
focus is not upon ensuring compliance with parole conditions
or obtaining evidence for introduction at administrative proceedings, but upon obtaining convictions of those who commit crimes. The noncriminal parole proceeding "falls outside the offending officer's zone of primary interest." Janis,
supra, at 458. Thus, even when the officer knows that the
subject of his search is a parolee, the officer will be deterred
from violating Fourth Amendment rights by the application
of the exclusionary rule to criminal trials.

Even when the officer performing the search is a parole
officer, the deterrence benefits of the exclusionary rule remain limited. Parole agents, in contrast to police officers,
are not "engaged in the often competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime," United States v. Leon, 468 U. S., at 914;
instead, their primary concern is whether their parolees
should remain free on parole. Thus, their relationship with
parolees is more supervisory than adversarial. Griffin v.
Wisconsin, 483 U. S. 868, 879 (1987). It is thus "unfair to
assume that the parole officer bears hostility against the parolee that destroys his neutrality; realistically the failure of
the parolee is in a sense a failure for his supervising officer."
Morrissey v. Brewer, supra, at 485-486. Although this relationship does not prevent parole officers from ever violating
the Fourth Amendment rights of their parolees, it does mean

Stevens, J., dissenting
that the harsh deterrent of exclusion is unwarranted, givensuch other deterrents as departmental training and discipline and the threat of damages actions. Moreover, al-though in some instances parole officers may act like police
officers and seek to uncover evidence of illegal activity, they(like police officers) are undoubtedly aware that any unconstitutionally seized evidence that could lead to an indictmentcould be suppressed in a criminal trial. In this case, assuming that the search violated respondent's Fourth Amendmentrights, the evidence could have been inadmissible at trial if
respondent had been criminally prosecuted.

We have long been averse to imposing federal require-ments upon the parole systems of the States. A federal requirement that parole boards apply the exclusionary rule,which is itself a " `grud[g]ingly taken, medicament,' "

UnitedStates v. Janis, supra, at 455, n. 29, would severely disrupt the traditionally informal, administrative process of pa-role revocation. The marginal deterrence of unreasonable
searches and seizures is insufficient to justify such an intru-sion. We therefore hold that parole boards are not required
by federal law to exclude evidence obtained in violation ofthe Fourth Amendment. Accordingly, the judgment below
is reversed, and the case is remanded to the PennsylvaniaSupreme Court.

It is so ordered.
Justice Stevens, dissenting.
Justice Souter has explained why the deterrent functionof the exclusionary rule is implicated as much by a parole

revocation proceeding as by a conventional criminal trial. Iagree with that explanation. I add this comment merely to
endorse Justice Stewart's conclusion that the "rule is consti-tutionally required, not as a `right' explicitly incorporated in
the fourth amendment's prohibitions, but as a remedy neces-sary to ensure that those prohibitions are observed in fact."

Justice Souter, with whom Justice Ginsburg and
Justice Breyer join, dissenting.

The Court's holding that the exclusionary rule of Mapp v.
Ohio, 367 U. S. 643 (1961), has no application to parole revocation proceedings rests upon mistaken conceptions of theactual function of revocation, of the objectives of those who

gather evidence in support of petitions to revoke, and, consequently, of the need to deter violations of the Fourth Amendment that would tend to occur in administering the parole
laws. In reality a revocation proceeding often serves the
same function as a criminal trial, and the revocation hearing
may very well present the only forum in which the State will
seek to use evidence of a parole violation, even when that
evidence would support an independent criminal charge.
The deterrent function of the exclusionary rule is therefore
implicated as much by a revocation proceeding as by a conventional trial, and the exclusionary rule should be applied
accordingly. From the Court's conclusion to the contrary, I
respectfully dissent.

This Court has said that the primary purpose of the exclusionary rule "is to deter future unlawful police conduct and
thereby effectuate the guarantee of the Fourth Amendment
against unreasonable searches and seizures." United States
v. Calandra, 414 U. S. 338, 347 (1974). Because the exclusionary rule thus "operates as a judicially created remedy
designed to safeguard Fourth Amendment rights generally
through its deterrent effect, rather than a personal constitu524US2 Unit: $U90 [09-15-00 14:33:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN

tional right of the party aggrieved," United States v. Leon,
468 U. S. 897, 906 (1984) (internal quotation marks omitted),
"[w]hether the exclusionary sanction is appropriately imposed in a particular case . . . is `an issue separate from the
question whether the Fourth Amendment rights of the party
seeking to invoke the rule were violated by police conduct.' "
Ibid. (quoting Illinois v. Gates, 462 U. S. 213, 223 (1983)).
The exclusionary rule does not, therefore, mandate the exclusion of illegally acquired evidence from all proceedings or
against all persons, United States v. Calandra, supra, at 348,
and we have made clear that the rule applies only in "those
instances where its remedial objectives are thought most efficaciously served," Arizona v. Evans, 514 U. S. 1, 11 (1995).
Only then can the deterrent value of applying the rule to a
given class of proceedings be seen to outweigh its price, including "the loss of often probative evidence and all of the
secondary costs that flow from the less accurate or more
cumbersome adjudication that therefore occurs." INS v.
Lopez-Mendoza, 468 U. S. 1032, 1041 (1984); see also United
States v. Janis, 428 U. S. 433, 454 (1976); United States v.
Calandra, supra, at 349-350.

Because we have found the requisite efficacy when the rule
is applied in criminal trials, see Elkins v. United States, 364
U. S. 206 (1960); Mapp v. Ohio, supra; Weeks v. United
States, 232 U. S. 383 (1914), the deterrent effect of the evidentiary limitation upon prosecution is a baseline for evaluating the degree (or incremental degree) of deterrence that
could be expected from extending the exclusionary rule to
other sorts of cases, see INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, supra.
Thus, we have thought that any additional deterrent value
obtainable from applying the rule in civil tax proceedings,
see United States v. Janis, supra, habeas proceedings, see
Stone v. Powell, 428 U. S. 465 (1976), and grand jury proceedings, see United States v. Calandra, supra, would be so marginal as to be outweighed by the incremental costs.

AND PAROLE v. SCOTT

Souter, J., dissenting

In Janis, for example, we performed incremental benefitanalysis by focusing on the two classes of law enforcement

officers affected. We reasoned that when the offending of-ficial was a state police officer, his "zone of primary interest"
would be state criminal prosecution, not federal civil proceedings; accordingly, we said, "common sense dictates thatthe deterrent effect of the exclusion of relevant evidence is

highly attenuated when the `punishment' imposed upon theoffending criminal enforcement officer is the removal of that
evidence from a civil suit by or against a different sover-eign." 428 U. S., at 457-458.

Stone v. Powell was another
variant on the same theme, where we looked to the collateralnature of the habeas proceedings in which the rule might be

applied: "The view that the deterrence of Fourth Amendment violations would be furthered rests on the dubiousassumption that law enforcement authorities would fear

that federal habeas review might reveal flaws in a search orseizure that went undetected at trial and on appeal." 428
U. S., at 493. And in United States v. Calandra we ob-served that excluding such evidence from grand jury proceedings "would deter only police investigation[s] consciouslydirected toward the discovery of evidence solely for use in a
grand jury investigation," 414 U. S., at 351; an investigation
so unambitious would be a rare one, we said, since prosecutors are unlikely to seek indictments in the face of dim prospects of conviction after trial, ibid.

In a formal sense, such is the reasoning of the Court's majority in deciding today that application of the exclusionary
rule in parole revocation proceedings would have only an insignificant marginal deterrent value, "because application of
the rule in the criminal trial context already provides significant deterrence of unconstitutional searches." Ante, at
364. In substance, however, the Court's conclusion will not
jibe with the examples just cited, for it rests on erroneous
views of the roles of regular police and parole officers in relation to revocation proceedings, and of the practical significance of the proceedings themselves.

Souter, J., dissenting
As to the police, the majority says that regular officersinvestigating crimes almost always act with the prospect of

a criminal prosecution before them. Their fear of eviden-tiary suppression in the criminal trial will have as much deterrent effect as can be expected, therefore, while any risk
of suppression in parole administration is too unlikely to beon their minds to influence their conduct.

The majority's assumption will only sometimes be true,however, and in many, or even most cases, it will quite likely
be false. To be sure, if a police officer acts on the spur ofthe moment to seize evidence or thwart crime, he may have
no idea of a perpetrator's parole status. But the contrarywill almost certainly be the case when he has first identified
the person he has his eye on: the local police know the local
felons, criminal history information is instantly available na-tionally, and police and parole officers routinely cooperate.

See, e. g., United States ex rel. Santos v. New York State Bd.
of Parole, 441 F. 2d 1216, 1217 (CA2 1971) (police officer, who
had obtained "reasonable grounds" to believe that the pa-rolee was dealing in stolen goods, informed the parole officer;

the parole officer and police officer together searched parol-ee's apartment), cert. denied, 404 U. S. 1025 (1972);

parolee's apartment); see also Pennsylvania Board of Proba-tion and Parole, Police Procedures in the Handling of Parolees 16 (rev. 1974) (parole agent has a responsibility to informpolice in the area where parolee will be living and to provide
"full cooperation to the police").

As these cases show, the police very likely do know a pa-rolee's status when they go after him, and (contrary to the

majority's assumption) this fact is significant for three rea-sons. First, and most obviously, the police have reason for
concern with the outcome of a parole revocation proceeding,which is just as foreseeable as the criminal trial and at least
as likely to be held. Police officers, especially those employed by the same sovereign that runs the parole system,
therefore have every incentive not to jeopardize a recommitment by rendering evidence inadmissible. See INS v.
Lopez-Mendoza, 468 U. S., at 1043 (deterrence especially effective when law enforcement and prosecution are under one
government). Second, as I will explain below, the actual
likelihood of trial is often far less than the probability of a
petition for parole revocation, with the consequence that the
revocation hearing will be the only forum in which the evidence will ever be offered. Often, therefore, there will be
nothing incremental about the significance of evidence offered in the administrative tribunal, and nothing "marginal"
about the deterrence provided by an exclusionary rule operating there. Ante, at 368. Finally, the cooperation between parole and police officers, as in the instances shown in
the cases cited above, casts serious doubt upon the aptness
of treating police officers differently from parole officers,
doubt that is confirmed by the following attention to the
Court's characterization of the position of the parole officer.

The Court recalls our description of the police as "engaged
in the often competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime,"
which raises the temptation to cut constitutional corners
(which in turn requires the countervailing influence of the
exclusionary rule). United States v. Leon, 468 U. S., at 914.

Souter, J., dissenting
As against this picture of the police, the Court paints theparole officer as a figure more nearly immune to such competitive zeal. As the Court describes him, the parole officeris interested less in catching a parole violator than in making
sure that the parolee continues to go straight, since " `realistically the failure of the parolee is in a sense a failure for hissupervising officer.' "

Ante, at 368 (quoting Morrissey v.
Brewer, 408 U. S. 471, 485-486 (1972)). This view of the pa-role officer suffers, however, from its selectiveness. Parole

officers wear several hats; while they are indeed the parol-ees' counselors and social workers, they also "often serve
as both prosecutors and law enforcement officials in their
relationship with probationers and parolees." N. Cohen &
J. Gobert, Law of Probation and Parole $ 11.04, p. 533 (1983);
see also Minnesota v. Murphy, 465 U. S. 420, 432 (1984) (probation officer "is a peace officer, and as such is allied, to a
greater or lesser extent, with his fellow peace officers" (internal quotation marks omitted)); T. Wile, Pennsylvania Law
of Probation and Parole $ 5.12, p. 88 (1993) (parole officers
"act in various capacities, supervisor, social worker, advocate, police officer, investigator and advisor, to the offenders
under their supervision"). Indeed, a parole officer's obligation to petition for revocation when a parolee goes bad, see
Cohen & Gobert, supra, $ 11.04, at 533, is presumably the
basis for the legal rule in Pennsylvania that "state parole
agents are considered police officers with respect to the offenders under their jurisdiction," Wile, supra, $ 5.12, at 89.

Once, in fact, the officer has turned from counselor to adversary, there is every reason to expect at least as much
competitive zeal from him as from a regular police officer.
See Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U. S. 778, 785 (1973) ("[A]n exclusive focus on the benevolent attitudes of those who administer the probation/parole system when it is working successfully obscures the modification in attitude which is likely to
take place once the officer has decided to recommend revocation"). If he fails to respond to his parolee's further crimi524US2 Unit: $U90 [09-15-00 14:33:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN

nality he will be neglecting the public safety, and if he bringsa revocation petition without enough evidence to sustain it

he can hardly look forward to professional advancement.R. Prus & J. Stratton, Parole Revocation Decisionmaking:
Private Typings and Official Designations, 40 Federal Proba-tion 51 (Mar. 1976). And as for competitiveness, one need
only ask whether a parole officer would rather leave thecredit to state or local police when a parolee has to be
brought to book.The Court, of course, does not mean to deny that parole
officers are subject to some temptation to skirt the limits onsearch and seizure, but it believes that deterrents other than
the evidentiary exclusion will suffice. The Court contendsthat parole agents will be kept within bounds by "departmental training and discipline and the threat of damages ac-tions." Ante, at 369. The same, of course, might be said of
the police, and yet as to them such arguments are not heard,perhaps for the same reason that the Court's suggestion
sounds hollow as to parole officers. The Court points to nospecific departmental training regulation; it cites no instance
of discipline imposed on a Pennsylvania parole officer for con-ducting an illegal search of a parolee's residence; and, least
surprisingly of all, the majority mentions not a single lawsuitbrought by a parolee against a parole officer seeking damages for an illegal search. In sum, if the police need thedeterrence of an exclusionary rule to offset the temptations
to forget the Fourth Amendment, parole officers need itquite as much.

1 While it is true that the Court found in INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, 468
U. S. 1032 (1984), that the deterrence value of applying the exclusionary
rule in deportation proceedings was diminished because the INS "has its
own comprehensive scheme for deterring Fourth Amendment violations
by its officers," id., at 1044, and "alternative remedies for institutional
practices by the INS that might violate Fourth Amendment rights" were
available, id., at 1045, these two factors reflected what was at least on the
agency's books and, in any event, did not stand alone. The Court in that
case found that as a practical matter "it is highly unlikely that any particu524US2 Unit: $U90 [09-15-00 14:33:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Souter, J., dissenting
Just as the Court has underestimated the competitive in-fluences tending to induce police and parole officers to stint

on Fourth Amendment obligations, so I think it has mis-understood the significance of admitting illegally seized evidence at the revocation hearing. On the one hand, the ma-jority magnifies the cost of an exclusionary rule for parole
cases by overemphasizing the differences between a revoca-tion hearing and a trial, and on the other hand it has minimized the benefits by failing to recognize the significant like-lihood that the revocation hearing will be the principal, not
the secondary, forum, in which evidence of a parolee's crimi-nal conduct will be offered.

The Court is, of course, correct that the revocation hear-ing has not only an adversarial side in factfinding, but a predictive and discretionary aspect in addressing the properdisposition when a violation has been found. See ante, at
366 (citing Gagnon v. Scarpelli, supra, at 787 (quoting Mor-rissey v. Brewer, supra, at 480)). And I agree that openmindedness at the discretionary, dispositional stage is pro-moted by the relative informality of the proceeding even at
its factfinding stage. Gagnon v. Scarpelli, supra, at 786.That informality is fostered by limiting issues so that lawyers are not always necessary, 411 U. S., at 787-788, andby appointing lay members to parole boards,

Morrissey v.Brewer, supra, at 489. There is no question, either, that

application of an exclusionary rule, if there is no waiver ofFourth Amendment rights, will tend to underscore the adversary character of the factfinding process. This cannot,however, be a dispositive objection to an exclusionary rule.
Any revocation hearing is adversary to a degree: counselmust now be provided whenever the complexity of fact issues
so warrant, Gagnon v. Scarpelli, supra, at 787, and lay boardmembers are just as capable of passing upon Fourth Amendlar arrestee will end up challenging the lawfulness of his arrest in a formal
deportation proceeding." Id., at 1044. As the instant case may suggest,
there is no reason to expect parolees to be so reticent.

ment issues as the police, who are necessarily charged with
responsibility for the legality of warrantless arrests, investigatory stops, and searches.2

As to the benefit of an exclusionary rule in revocation proceedings, the majority does not see that in the investigation
of criminal conduct by someone known to be on parole,
Fourth Amendment standards will have very little deterrent
sanction unless evidence offered for parole revocation is subject to suppression for unconstitutional conduct. It is not
merely that parole revocation is the government's consolation prize when, for whatever reason, it cannot obtain a further criminal conviction, though that will sometimes be true.
See, e. g., State ex rel. Wright v. Ohio Adult Parole Auth.,
75 Ohio St. 3d, at 83-89, 661 N. E. 2d, at 730 (State sought
revocation of parole when criminal prosecution was dismissed for insufficient evidence after defendant's motion to
suppress was successful); Anderson v. Virginia, 20 Va. App.
361, 363-364, 457 S. E. 2d 396, 397 (1995) (same); Chase v.
Maryland, 309 Md. 224, 228, 522 A. 2d 1348, 1350 (1987)
(same); Gronski v. Wyoming, 700 P. 2d 777, 778 (Wyo. 1985)
(same). What is at least equally telling is that parole revocation will frequently be pursued instead of prosecution as
the course of choice, a fact recognized a quarter of a century

2 On the subject of cost, the majority also argues that the cost of applying the exclusionary rule to revocation proceedings would be high because
States have an " `overwhelming interest' " in ensuring that its parolees
comply with the conditions of their parole, given the fact that parolees are
more likely to commit future crimes than average citizens. Ante, at 365.
I certainly do not contest the fact, but merely point out that it does not
differentiate suppression at parole hearings from suppression at trials,
where suppression of illegally obtained evidence in the prosecution's case
in chief certainly takes some toll on the State's interest in convicting criminals in the first place. The majority's argument suggests not that the
exclusionary rule is necessarily out of place in parole revocation proceedings, but that States should be permitted to condition parole on an agreement to submit to warrantless, suspicionless searches, on the possibility of
which this case has no bearing. See infra, at 379-380.

ago when we observed in Morrissey v. Brewer that a parolerevocation proceeding "is often preferred to a new prosecution because of the procedural ease of recommitting the indi-vidual on the basis of a lesser showing by the State." 408
U. S., at 479; see also Cohen & Gobert, $ 8.06, at 386 ("Favoring the [exclusionary] rule's applicability is the fact that therevocation proceeding, often based on the items discovered

in the search, is used in lieu of a criminal trial").The reasons for this tendency to skip any new prosecution
are obvious. If the conduct in question is a crime in its ownright, the odds of revocation are very high. Since time on
the street before revocation is not subtracted from the balance of the sentence to be served on revocation, Morrissey
v. Brewer, 408 U. S., at 480, the balance may well be long
enough to render recommitment the practical equivalent of
a new sentence for a separate crime. And all of this may
be accomplished without shouldering the burden of proof
beyond a reasonable doubt; hence the obvious popularity of
revocation in place of new prosecution.

The upshot is that without a suppression remedy in revocation proceedings, there will often be no influence capable
of deterring Fourth Amendment violations when parole revocation is a possible response to new crime. Suppression in
the revocation proceeding cannot be looked upon, then, as
furnishing merely incremental or marginal deterrence over
and above the effect of exclusion in criminal prosecution.
Instead, it will commonly provide the only deterrence to unconstitutional conduct when the incarceration of parolees is
sought, and the reasons that support the suppression remedy
in prosecution therefore support it in parole revocation.

Because I would apply the exclusionary rule to evidence
offered in revocation hearings, I would affirm the judgment
in this case. Scott gave written consent to warrantless
searches; the form he signed provided that he consented "to
the search of my person, property and residence, without a
warrant by agents of the Pennsylvania Board of Probation

and Parole." App. 7a. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvaniaheld the consent insufficient to waive any requirement that

searches be supported by reasonable suspicion,3 and in theabsence of any such waiver, the State was bound to justify
its search by what the Court has described as informationindicating the likelihood of facts justifying the search.

Grif-fin v. Wisconsin, 483 U. S. 868 (1987) (dealing with the analogous context of probation revocation). The State makes noclaim here to have satisfied this standard. It describes the
parole agent's knowledge as rising no further than "the pos-sibility of the presence of weapons in Scott's home," Brief
for Petitioner 7, and rests on the argument that not evenreasonable suspicion was required.

Because the search violated the Fourth Amendment, andbecause I conclude that the exclusionary rule ought to apply
to parole revocation proceedings, I would affirm the decisionof the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania.

3 See 548 Pa. 418, 426, 698 A. 2d 32, 35-36 (1997) (" `[T]he parolee's signing of a parole agreement giving his parole officer permission to conduct
a warrantless search does not mean either that the parole officer can conduct a search at any time and for any reason or that the parolee relinquishes his Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable
searches. Rather, the parolee's signature acts as acknowledgement that
the parole officer has a right to conduct reasonable searches of his
residence listed on the parole agreement without a warrant' ") (quoting
Commonwealth v. Williams, 547 Pa. 577, 588, 692 A. 2d 1031, 1036 (1997)).
Since Pennsylvania has not sought review of this conclusion, I do not look
behind it, or offer any opinion on whether the terms and sufficiency of
such a waiver are to be scrutinized under state or federal law.

WISCONSIN DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS

et al. v. SCHACHT

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe seventh circuit

No. 97-461. Argued April 20, 1998--Decided June 22, 1998
Respondent Schacht filed a state-court suit against the defendants (petitioners here), the Wisconsin Department of Corrections and several of
its employees, both in their "personal" and in their "official" capacities,
alleging that his dismissal from his prison guard position violated the
Federal Constitution and federal civil rights laws. The defendants removed the case to federal court and then filed an answer raising the
"defense" that the Eleventh Amendment doctrine of sovereign immunity barred the claims against the Department and its employees in
their official capacity. The District Court granted the individual defendants summary judgment on the "personal capacity" claims and dismissed the claims against the Department and the individual defendants
in their "official capacity." On appeal, Schacht challenged only the disposition of the "personal capacity" claims, but the Seventh Circuit determined that the removal had been improper because the presence of even
one claim subject to an Eleventh Amendment bar deprives the federal
courts of removal jurisdiction over the entire case.

Held: The presence in an otherwise removable case of a claim barred by

the Eleventh Amendment does not destroy removal jurisdiction that
would otherwise exist. A federal court can proceed to hear the remaining claims, and the District Court did not err in doing so in this case.
Pp. 386-393.

(a) Title 28 U. S. C. $ 1441(a), which allows a defendant to remove
"any civil action brought in a State court of which the [federal] district
courts . . . have original jurisdiction," obviously permits the removal
of a case containing only claims that "arise under" federal law, since
federal courts have original jurisdiction over such claims, see $ 1331.
There are several parts to respondent's argument that removal jurisdiction is destroyed if one of those federal claims is subject to an Eleventh Amendment bar. First, the argument distinguishes cases with
both federal-law and state-law claims from cases with federal-law claims
that include one or more Eleventh Amendment claims. In the former
cases the state-law claims fall within the federal courts' supplemental
jurisdiction. In the latter cases the comparable claims are ones that
the Eleventh Amendment prohibits the federal courts from deciding.

Syllabus
Second, the argument emphasizes the "jurisdictional" nature of the
difference, since neither the law permitting supplemental jurisdiction, nor any other law, gives the federal court the power to decide a
claim barred by the Eleventh Amendment. Third, the argument looks
to removal based upon "diversity jurisdiction" for analogical authority
leading to its conclusion that the "jurisdictional" problem is so serious
that the presence of even one Eleventh Amendment barred claim destroys removal jurisdiction with respect to all claims, i. e., the "case."
The analogy is unconvincing, for this case differs significantly from diversity cases with respect to original jurisdiction. The presence of a
nondiverse party automatically destroys such jurisdiction: No party
need assert the defect. No party can waive the defect, or consent to
jurisdiction. No court can ignore the defect; rather a court, noticing the defect, must raise the matter on its own. In contrast, the Eleventh Amendment does not automatically destroy original jurisdiction.
It grants the State a legal power to assert a sovereign immunity defense. The State can waive the defense, and a court may ignore the
defect unless it is raised by the State. Since a federal court would have
original jurisdiction to hear this case had Schacht originally filed it
there, the defendants may remove the case from state to federal courts.
Other conditions--e. g., the fact that removal jurisdiction is determined
as of the time a case was filed in state court, which was before the
defendants filed their answer in federal court--further undermine the
analogy. Pp. 386-391.

(b) Schacht's one further argument--that, after the State asserted its
Eleventh Amendment defense, the federal court lacked subject-matter
jurisdiction over the entire case and thus had to remand it to state court
under $ 1447(c)--is rejected. An ordinary reading of $ 1447(c) indicates
that it refers to an instance in which a federal court "lacks subject matter jurisdiction" over a "case," not simply over one claim within the
case. Moreover, $ 1447(c)'s objective--to specify the procedures that a
federal court must follow in remanding a case after removal--is irrelevant to the question presented here. Pp. 391-393.

David E. Lasker argued the cause and filed a brief forrespondent.*

Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court.
The question before us is whether defendants in a casefiled in a state court, with claims "arising under" federal law,

can remove that case to federal court--where some claims,made against a State, are subject to an Eleventh Amendment bar. We conclude that the defendants can remove thecase to a federal court and that the court can decide the
nonbarred claims. I

In 1993, the Wisconsin Department of Corrections dis-missed Keith Schacht, a prison guard, for stealing items from
the Oakhill Correctional Institution, a state prison. In Jan-uary 1996, Schacht filed a complaint in state court against
the Department and several of its employees, both in their"personal" and in their "official" capacities. The complaint,
in several different claims, alleged that the Department andits employees had deprived Schacht of "liberty" and "property" without "due process of law," thereby violating theFederal Constitution and civil rights laws. U. S. Const.,

Opinion of the Court
Amdt. 14, $ 1; Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983. The defendants immediately removed the case to federal court.

The defendants' answer, filed in federal court, in part
raised as a "defense" that the "eleventh amendment to the
United States Constitution, and the doctrine of sovereign immunity, bars any claim under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 against" the
State itself, namely, the "defendant Wisconsin Department
of Corrections [and] against any of the named defendants in
their official capacities." Answer and Defenses, App. 14-15.
See Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U. S. 159, 165-167, and n. 14
(1985) (suit for damages against state officer in official capacity is barred by the Eleventh Amendment); Alabama
v. Pugh, 438 U. S. 781, 782 (1978) (per curiam) (suit against
state agency is barred by the Eleventh Amendment).

After further proceedings, the Federal District Court
considered those claims that were not against the State,
that is, the claims against the individual defendants in their
"personal capacit[ies]." It concluded as to those claims that,
even if Schacht's factual allegations were true, Schacht
had received the process that was his "due," and his dismissal did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment. No. 96-
C-122-S (WD Wis., Sept. 13, 1996), App. 31-34. It therefore granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment
with respect to those claims. Id., at 34.

The federal court also considered the defendants' motion
to dismiss those claims filed against the State, i. e., the claims
against the Department of Corrections and its employees in
their "official capacities." The District Court granted the
motion, stating:

"Plaintiff agrees his claims for money damages are
barred [by the Eleventh Amendment] but pursues his
claims for injunctive relief. Plaintiff does not, however,
request injunctive relief in his complaint . . . . Defendants' motion to dismiss plaintiff 's claims against the Wisconsin Department of Corrections and the individual

Opinion of the Court
defendants in their official capacities will be granted."Id., at 30.

Schacht appealed. He did not assert that the DistrictCourt was wrong to have dismissed the claims against the
State. He argued only that the court's disposition of the"personal capacity" claims, i. e., the grant of summary judgment, was legally erroneous. During the appeal, the Courtof Appeals for the Seventh Circuit itself raised the question
whether the removal from state to federal court had beenlegally permissible. See 116 F. 3d 1151, 1153 (1997). After
supplemental briefing, the Court of Appeals concluded thatremoval had been improper and the federal courts lacked
jurisdiction over Schacht's case. Ibid.The Court of Appeals pointed out that Schacht's original
state-court complaint, while presenting only claims arisingunder federal law, asserted some of those claims against the
State. Id., at 1152. The court added that the EleventhAmendment, as interpreted by this Court, prohibited the assertion of those claims in federal court. Ibid. (citing U. S.Const., Amdt. 11; Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U. S 1, 10 (1890)).
The Court of Appeals concluded that the presence of evenone such claim in an otherwise removable case deprived the
federal courts of removal jurisdiction over the entire case.116 F. 3d, at 1152-1153 (relying on

Frances J. v. Wright, 19F. 3d 337, 341 (CA7 1994)). Hence, it held, the District

Court's judgment must be vacated and the entire case re-turned to the state court for the litigation to begin all over
again. 116 F. 3d, at 1153-1154.We granted certiorari to review the Seventh Circuit's view
of the matter, and the similar views taken in several earliercases upon which that court relied, see,

e. g., Frances J.,supra; McKay v. Boyd Constr. Co., 769 F. 2d 1084 (CA5 1985).

Those decisions conflict with the decisions of other Courts ofAppeals. See, e. g., Kruse v. Hawai`i, 68 F. 3d 331 (CA9
1995); Henry v. Metropolitan Sewer Dist., 922 F. 2d 332 (CA61990); see also Silver v. Baggiano, 804 F. 2d 1211 (CA11

Opinion of the Court
1986). We now conclude, contrary to the Seventh Circuit,that the presence in an otherwise removable case of a claim

that the Eleventh Amendment may bar does not destroy re-moval jurisdiction that would otherwise exist.

II
The governing provision of the federal removal statute au-thorizes a defendant to remove "any civil action brought in

a State court of which the district courts of the United Stateshave original jurisdiction." 28 U. S. C. $ 1441(a). See also
Judiciary Act of 1789, $ 12, 1 Stat. 79-80 (original removalstatute); Act of Mar. 3, 1887, 24 Stat. 552, corrected by Act
of Aug. 13, 1888, 25 Stat. 433 (setting forth removal powerin terms roughly similar to present law). The language of
this section obviously permits the removal of a case that con-tains only claims that "arise under" federal law. That is because a federal statute explicitly grants the federal courts"original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the
Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States," 28U. S. C. $ 1331. This case, however, requires us to consider
what happens if one, or more, of those claims is subject to anEleventh Amendment bar. Does that circumstance destroy
removal jurisdiction that would otherwise exist?The primary argument that it does destroy removal jurisdiction has several parts. First, the argument distinguishesa case with federal-law claims that include one or more Eleventh Amendment claims from a case with both federal-lawclaims and state-law claims. See 116 F. 3d, at 1152. We
have suggested that the presence of even one claim "arisingunder" federal law is sufficient to satisfy the requirement
that the case be within the original jurisdiction of the dis-trict court for removal. See Chicago v. International College of Surgeons, 522 U. S. 156, 163-166 (1997). In Chicago,for example, we wrote:

"[The] federal claims suffice to make the actions `civilactions' within the `original jurisdiction' of the district

Opinion of the Court
courts for purposes of removal. . . . Nothing in the ju-risdictional statutes suggests that the presence of related state law claims somehow alters the fact that [the]complaints, by virtue of their federal claims, were `civil
actions' within the federal courts' `original jurisdic-tion.' "

Id., at 166 (citation omitted).

See also Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Taylor, 481 U. S. 58(1987); Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal. v. Construction Laborers

Vacation Trust for Southern Cal., 463 U. S. 1, 7-12 (1983).This statement, however, and others like it, appear in the
context of cases involving both federal-law and state-lawclaims. And the Seventh Circuit found a significant difference between such cases and cases in which the EleventhAmendment applies to some of the federal-law claims. See
116 F. 3d, at 1152. In the former cases the state-law claimsfall within the supplemental jurisdiction of the federal
courts. Supplemental jurisdiction allows federal courts tohear and decide state-law claims along with federal-law
claims when they "are so related to claims in the actionwithin such original jurisdiction that they form part of the
same case or controversy." 28 U. S. C. $ 1367(a); see Chi-cago, supra, at 164-166. Cf. $ 1441(c) (explicitly providing
discretionary removal jurisdiction over entire case wherefederal claim is accompanied by a "separate and independent" state-law claim). In the latter cases, the comparableclaims do not fall within the federal courts' "pendent" jurisdiction, but rather, it is argued, are claims that the EleventhAmendment prohibits the federal courts from deciding.

Second, the argument emphasizes the "jurisdictional" na-ture of this difference. The Seventh Circuit, for example,
said: "Claims barred by sovereign immunity stand on differ-ent footing than other claims that are not independently removable, because of the affirmative limitation on jurisdictionimposed by the sovereign immunity doctrines." 116 F. 3d,
at 1152 (citing Frances J., supra, at 340-341, and n. 4). Thatis to say, according to the Court of Appeals, neither the law

Opinion of the Court
permitting supplemental jurisdiction, nor any other law, see,
e. g., $ 1441(c), gives the federal court the power to decide a
claim barred by the Eleventh Amendment. See Pennhurst
State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U. S. 89, 121
(1984); Frances J., 19 F. 3d, at 341.

Third, the argument looks to removal based upon "diversity jurisdiction," 28 U. S. C. $ 1332, for analogical authority that leads to its conclusion, namely, that this "jurisdictional" problem is so serious that the presence of even one
Eleventh-Amendment-barred claim destroys removal jurisdiction with respect to all claims (i. e., the entire "case").
See, e. g., 116 F. 3d, at 1152 (citing Frances J., supra, at 341);
McKay v. Boyd Constr. Co., 769 F. 2d, at 1086-1087 (discussing analogy to removal based on diversity jurisdiction). A
case falls within the federal district court's "original" diversity "jurisdiction" only if diversity of citizenship among the
parties is complete, i. e., only if there is no plaintiff and no
defendant who are citizens of the same State. See Carden
v. Arkoma Associates, 494 U. S. 185, 187 (1990); Strawbridge
v. Curtiss, 3 Cranch 267 (1806). But cf. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.
21; Newman-Green, Inc. v. Alfonzo-Larrain, 490 U. S. 826,
832-838 (1989) (Rule 21 authorizes courts to dismiss nondiverse defendants in order to cure jurisdictional defects, instead of the entire case). Consequently, this Court has indicated that a defendant cannot remove a case that contains
some claims against "diverse" defendants as long as there is
one claim brought against a "nondiverse" defendant. See
Caterpillar Inc. v. Lewis, 519 U. S. 61, 68-69 (1996). If the
analogy is appropriate, then, an Eleventh Amendment bar
with respect to one claim would prevent removal of a case
that contains some "arising under" claims, which, had they
stood alone, would have permitted removal. Frances J.,
supra, at 341; McKay, supra, at 1087.

We find the analogy unconvincing. This case differs significantly from a diversity case with respect to a federal dis524US2 Unit: $U91 [09-06-00 17:16:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN

389Cite as: 524 U. S. 381 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
trict court's original jurisdiction. The presence of the nondiverse party automatically destroys original jurisdiction:
No party need assert the defect. No party can waive the
defect or consent to jurisdiction. Insurance Corp. of Ireland v. Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee, 456 U. S. 694,
702 (1982); People's Bank v. Calhoun, 102 U. S. 256, 260-261
(1880). No court can ignore the defect; rather a court, noticing the defect, must raise the matter on its own. Insurance
Corp. of Ireland, supra, at 702; Mansfield, C. & L. M. R. Co.
v. Swan, 111 U. S. 379, 382 (1884).

The Eleventh Amendment, however, does not automatically destroy original jurisdiction. Rather, the Eleventh
Amendment grants the State a legal power to assert a sovereign immunity defense should it choose to do so. The State
can waive the defense. Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S. 234, 241 (1985); Clark v. Barnard, 108 U. S.
436, 447 (1883). Nor need a court raise the defect on its
own. Unless the State raises the matter, a court can ignore
it. See Patsy v. Board of Regents of Fla., 457 U. S. 496, 515,
n. 19 (1982).

These differences help to explain why governing authority
has treated the defects differently for purposes of original
jurisdiction. Where original jurisdiction rests upon Congress' statutory grant of "diversity jurisdiction," this Court
has held that one claim against one nondiverse defendant
destroys that original jurisdiction. See, e. g., NewmanGreen, Inc., supra, at 829 ("When a plaintiff sues more than
one defendant in a diversity action, the plaintiff must meet
the requirements of the diversity statute for each defendant
or face dismissal"). But, where original jurisdiction rests
upon the Statute's grant of "arising under" jurisdiction, the
Court has assumed that the presence of a potential Eleventh
Amendment bar with respect to one claim, has not destroyed
original jurisdiction over the case. E. g., Pugh, 438 U. S.,
at 782; Papasan v. Allain, 478 U. S. 265 (1986). See also

Opinion of the Court
Henry, 922 F. 2d, at 338-339; Roberts v. College of the Desert,870 F. 2d 1411, 1415 (CA9 1988). Cf.

Pennhurst, supra, at
121 (suggesting that courts must analyze the applicability ofthe Eleventh Amendment to each claim rather than case as

whole). Since a federal court would have original jurisdiction to hear this case had Schacht originally filed it there,the defendants may remove the case from state to federal

courts. See $ 1441(a).Other considerations further undermine the analogy. For
example, for purposes of removal jurisdiction, we are to lookat the case as of the time it was filed in state court--prior
to the time the defendants filed their answer in federal court.
See, e. g., St. Paul Mercury Indemnity Co. v. Red Cab Co.,
303 U. S. 283, 291 (1938) ("[T]he status of the case as disclosed by the plaintiff 's complaint is controlling in the case

of a removal, since the defendant must file his petition before
the time for answer or forever lose his right to remove").
As of that time, a case that involved "incomplete diversity"
automatically would have fallen outside the federal courts'
"original jurisdiction." By contrast, as of that time, the
State's participation as a defendant would not automatically
have placed the case outside the federal courts' jurisdictional
authority. That is because the underlying relevant condition (the federal courts' effort to assert jurisdiction over an
objecting State) could not have existed prior to removal, see,
e. g., Maine v. Thiboutot, 448 U. S. 1, 9, n. 7 (1980), and because the State might not have asserted the defense in federal court, but could have decided instead to defend on the
merits. (Here, for example, the State, while not waiving its
Eleventh Amendment defense, has asserted in the alternative that Schacht could not state a $ 1983 claim against the
State. See Will v. Michigan Dept. of State Police, 491 U. S.
58, 64 (1989).)

These differences between "diversity" and "Eleventh
Amendment" cases with respect to original and removal jurisdiction are sufficient to destroy the analogy upon which

391Cite as: 524 U. S. 381 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
the lower court opinions rest. A case such as this one ismore closely analogous to cases in which a later event, say,

the change in the citizenship of a party or a subsequent re-duction of the amount at issue below jurisdictional levels,
destroys previously existing jurisdiction. In such cases, afederal court will

keep a removed case. See St. Paul Mer-cury Indemnity Co., supra, at 293-295; Phelps v. Oaks, 117

U. S. 236, 240-241 (1886); Kanouse v. Martin, 15 How. 198,207-210 (1854). See also Carnegie-Mellon Univ. v. Cohill,
484 U. S. 343, 350, and n. 7 (1988) (federal court may exercisejurisdiction over remaining state-law claims under supplemental jurisdiction, if all federal-law claims are eliminatedbefore trial). Here, too, at the time of removal, this case fell
within the "original jurisdiction" of the federal courts. TheState's later invocation of the Eleventh Amendment placed
the particular claim beyond the power of the federal courtsto decide, but it did not destroy removal jurisdiction over
the entire case. III

We must consider one further argument that respondenthas made. That argument is not based upon an analogy but
upon the specific language of a particular statutory provision,28 U. S. C. $ 1447(c). The provision says: "If at any time before final judgment it appears that the district court lackssubject matter jurisdiction, the case shall be remanded."
Ibid. Respondent argues that, at least after the State as-serted its Eleventh Amendment defense, the federal court
"lacked subject matter jurisdiction." Brief for Respondent19. He points out that the statute says that the entire "case
shall be remanded" to the state court. That is to say, hecontends that, if the "district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction" over any claim, then every claim, i. e., the entire"case," must be "remanded" to the state court.

Even making the assumption that Eleventh Amendmentimmunity is a matter of subject-matter jurisdiction--a question we have not decided--we reject respondent's argument

Opinion of the Court
because we do not read the statute in this way. An ordinaryreading of the language indicates that the statute refers to

an instance in which a federal court "lacks subject matterjurisdiction" over a "case," and not simply over one claim
within a case. Cf. $ 1441(c) (permitting "the entire case" to
be removed or remanded, when one or more "non-removableclaims or causes of action" is joined with a federal question

"claim or cause of action"). Conceivably, one might alsoread the statute's reference to "case" to include a claim
within a case as well as the entire case. But neither readinghelps Schacht. The former reading would make the provision inapplicable here; the latter would make it applicable,
but requires remand only of the relevant claims, and not the
entire case as Schacht contends.

Nor does the statute's purpose favor Schacht's interpretation. The statutory section that contains the provision
deals, not with the question of what is removable, but with
the procedures that a federal court is to follow after removal
occurs. It is entitled: "Procedure after removal generally."

$ 1447. In substance, the section differentiates between removals that are defective because of lack of subject-matter
jurisdiction and removals that are defective for some other
reason, e. g., because the removal took place after relevant
time limits had expired. For the latter kind of case, there
must be a motion to remand filed no later than 30 days after
the filing of the removal notice. $ 1447(c). For the former
kind of case, remand may take place without such a motion
and at any time. Ibid. The provision, then, helps to specify
a procedural difference that flows from a difference in the
kinds of reasons that could lead to a remand. That objective
is irrelevant to the kind of problem presented in this case.

We repeat our conclusion: A State's proper assertion of an
Eleventh Amendment bar after removal means that the federal court cannot hear the barred claim. But that circumstance does not destroy removal jurisdiction over the remaining claims in the case before us. A federal court can

proceed to hear those other claims, and the District Courtdid not err in doing so.

For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appealsis vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings
consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered.

Justice Kennedy, concurring.
In joining the opinion of the Court, I write to observe wehave neither reached nor considered the argument that, by

giving its express consent to removal of the case from statecourt, Wisconsin waived its Eleventh Amendment immunity.
Insofar as the record shows, this issue was not raised in theproceedings below; and it was not part of the briefs filed here
or the arguments made to the Court. The question shouldbe considered, however, in some later case.

Removal requires the consent of all of the defendants.See,

e. g., Chicago, R. I. & P. R. Co. v. Martin, 178 U. S. 245,248 (1900); 14A C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal

Practice and Procedure $ 3731, p. 504 (2d ed. 1985). Herethe State consented to removal but then registered a prompt
objection to the jurisdiction of the United States DistrictCourt over the claim against it. By electing to remove, the
State created the difficult problem confronted in the Courtof Appeals and now here. This is the situation in which law
usually says a party must accept the consequences of its ownacts. It would seem simple enough to rule that once a State
consents to removal, it may not turn around and say theEleventh Amendment bars the jurisdiction of the federal
court. Consent to removal, it can be argued, is a waiver ofthe Eleventh Amendment immunity.

Given the latitude accorded the States in raising the immu-nity at a late stage, however, a rule of waiver may not be all
that obvious. The Court has said the Eleventh Amendmentbar may be asserted for the first time on appeal, so a State
which is sued in federal court does not waive the EleventhAmendment simply by appearing and defending on the mer524US2 Unit: $U91 [09-06-00 17:16:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN

its. See Florida Dept. of State v. Treasure Salvors, Inc.,458 U. S. 670, 683, n. 18 (1982) (plurality opinion); see also

Calderon v. Ashmus, 523 U. S. 740, 745, n. 2 (1998); Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U. S. 89,
99, n. 8 (1984); Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U. S. 651, 678 (1974);
Ford Motor Co. v. Department of Treasury of Ind., 323 U. S.459, 467 (1945).

I have my doubts about the propriety of this rule. In per-mitting the belated assertion of the Eleventh Amendment
bar, we allow States to proceed to judgment without facingany real risk of adverse consequences. Should the State
prevail, the plaintiff would be bound by principles of res judicata. If the State were to lose, however, it could void the
entire judgment simply by asserting its immunity on appeal.

This departure from the usual rules of waiver stems from
the hybrid nature of the jurisdictional bar erected by the
Eleventh Amendment. In certain respects, the immunity
bears substantial similarity to personal jurisdiction requirements, since it can be waived and courts need not raise the
issue sua sponte. See Patsy v. Board of Regents of Fla.,
457 U. S. 496, 516, n. 19 (1982). Permitting the immunity to
be raised at any stage of the proceedings, in contrast, is more
consistent with regarding the Eleventh Amendment as a
limit on the federal courts' subject-matter jurisdiction. See
Insurance Corp. of Ireland v. Compagnie des Bauxites de
Guinee, 456 U. S. 694, 702-704 (1982) (comparing personal
jurisdiction with subject-matter jurisdiction). We have
noted the inconsistency. Although the text is framed in
terms of the extent of the "Judicial power of the United
States," U. S. Const., Amdt. 11, our precedents have treated
the Eleventh Amendment as "enact[ing] a sovereign immunity from suit, rather than a nonwaivable limit on the federal judiciary's subject-matter jurisdiction." Idaho v. Coeur
d'Alene Tribe of Idaho, 521 U. S. 261, 267 (1997); see also
E. Chemerinsky, Federal Jurisdiction $ 7.6, p. 405 (2d ed.
1994) (noting that allowing waiver of the immunity "seems

Kennedy, J., concurring
inconsistent with viewing the Eleventh Amendment as a re-striction on the federal courts' subject matter jurisdiction").

The Court could eliminate the unfairness by modifyingour Eleventh Amendment jurisprudence to make it more consistent with our practice regarding personal jurisdiction.
Under a rule inferring waiver from the failure to raise theobjection at the outset of the proceedings, States would be

prevented from gaining an unfair advantage. See Fed. RuleCiv. Proc. 12(h)(1).

We would not need to make this substantial revision tofind waiver in the circumstances here, however. Even if appearing in federal court and defending on the merits is not
sufficient to constitute a waiver, a different case may be presented when a State under no compulsion to appear in federal court voluntarily invokes its jurisdiction. As the Court
recognized in Gunter v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 200 U. S.
273, 284 (1906), "where a State voluntarily becomes a party
to a cause and submits its rights for judicial determination,
it will be bound thereby and cannot escape the result of its
own voluntary act by invoking the prohibitions of the Eleventh Amendment."

An early decision of this Court applied this principle in
holding that a State's voluntary intervention in a federalcourt action to assert its own claim constituted a waiver of
the Eleventh Amendment. Clark v. Barnard, 108 U. S. 436,
447-448 (1883); see also Employees of Dept. of Public Health
and Welfare of Mo. v. Department of Public Health and Welfare of Mo., 411 U. S. 279, 294, n. 10 (1973) (Marshall, J., concurring in result) (citing Clark v. Barnard with approval);
Petty v. Tennessee-Missouri Bridge Comm'n, 359 U. S. 275,
276 (1959) (same); Missouri v. Fiske, 290 U. S. 18, 24-25
(1933) (same). The Court also found a waiver of the Eleventh Amendment when a State voluntarily appeared in bankruptcy court to file a claim against a common fund. Gardner
v. New Jersey, 329 U. S. 565, 574 (1947). Since a State which
is made a defendant to a state-court action is under no com524US2 Unit: $U91 [09-06-00 17:16:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Kennedy, J., concurring
pulsion to appear in federal court and, like any other defendant, has the unilateral right to block removal of the case, any
appearance the State makes in federal court may well be
regarded as voluntary in the same manner as the appearances which gave rise to the waivers in Clark and Gardner.

Some Courts of Appeals, following this reasoning, have
recognized that consent to removal may constitute a waiver.
Newfield House, Inc. v. Massachusetts Dept. of Pub. Welfare,
651 F. 2d 32, 36, n. 3 (CA1), cert. denied, 454 U. S. 1114 (1981);
see also Estate of Porter v. Illinois, 36 F. 3d 684, 691 (CA7
1994); Silver v. Baggiano, 804 F. 2d 1211, 1214 (CA11 1986);
Gwinn Area Community Schools v. Michigan, 741 F. 2d 840,
847 (CA6 1984). These cases have first inquired, however,
whether state law authorized the attorneys representing the
State to waive the Eleventh Amendment on its behalf. Petitioners cited this qualification when we raised the issue at
oral argument in the instant case. This was also the Court's
apparent concern in Ford Motor Co., in which it held:

"It is conceded by the respondents that if it is within
the power of the administrative and executive officers of
Indiana to waive the state's immunity, they have done
so in this proceeding. The issue thus becomes one of
their power under state law to do so. As this issue has
not been determined by state courts, this Court must
resort to the general policy of the state as expressed in
its Constitution, statutes and decisions. Article 4, $ 24
of the Indiana Constitution provides:

" `Provision may be made, by general law, for bringing
suit against the State, as to all liabilities originating
after the adoption of this Constitution; but no special act
authorizing such suit to be brought, or making compensation to any person claiming damages against the State,
shall ever be passed.'

"We interpret this provision as indicating a policy prohibiting state consent to suit in one particular case in

524US2 Unit: $U91 [09-06-00 17:16:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Kennedy, J., concurring
the absence of a general consent to suit in all similarcauses of action. Since the state legislature may waive

state immunity only by general law, it is not to be pre-sumed in the absence of clear language to the contrary,
that they conferred on administrative or executive offi-cers discretionary power to grant or withhold consent in
individual cases. . . . It would seem, therefore, that noproperly authorized executive or administrative officer
of the state has waived the state's immunity to suit inthe federal courts." 323 U. S., at 467-469 (footnotes
omitted).
See also Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U. S. 393, 396, n. 2 (1975).Notwithstanding the quoted language from Ford Motor

Co., the absence of specific authorization, it seems to me, isnot an insuperable obstacle to adopting a rule of waiver in
every case where the State, through its attorneys, consentsto removal from the state court to the federal court. If the
States know or have reason to expect that removal will con-stitute a waiver, then it is easy enough to presume that an
attorney authorized to represent the State can bind it to thejurisdiction of the federal court (for Eleventh Amendment
purposes) by the consent to removal.It is true as well that the Court's recent cases have disfavored constructive waivers of the Eleventh Amendment andhave required the State's consent to suit be unequivocal.
Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S. 234, 246-247(1985); Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U. S., at 673. The conduct
which may give rise to the waiver in the instance of removalis far less equivocal than the conduct at issue in those cases,
however. Here the State's consent amounted to a direct in-vocation of the jurisdiction of the federal courts, an act
considerably more specific than the general participation ina federal program found insufficient in

Atascadero andEdelman.

These questions should be explored. If it were demon-strated that a federal rule finding waiver of the Eleventh

Amendment when the State consents to removal would putStates at some unfair tactical disadvantage, perhaps the

waiver rule ought not to be embraced. I tend to doubt suchconsequences, however. Since the issue was not addressed
either by the parties or the Court of Appeals, the propercourse is for us to defer addressing the question until it is
presented for our consideration, supported by full briefingand argument, in some later case.

SWIDLER & BERLIN et al. v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe district of columbia circuit

No. 97-1192. Argued June 8, 1998--Decided June 25, 1998
When various investigations of the 1993 dismissal of White House Travel

Office employees were beginning, Deputy White House Counsel Vincent
W. Foster, Jr., met with petitioner Hamilton, an attorney at petitioner
law firm, to seek legal representation. Hamilton took handwritten
notes at their meeting. Nine days later, Foster committed suicide.
Subsequently, a federal grand jury, at the Independent Counsel's request, issued subpoenas for, inter alia, the handwritten notes as part of
an investigation into whether crimes were committed during the prior
investigations into the firings. Petitioners moved to quash, arguing,
among other things, that the notes were protected by the attorneyclient privilege. The District Court agreed and denied enforcement of
the subpoenas. In reversing, the Court of Appeals recognized that
most courts assume the privilege survives death, but noted that such
references usually occur in the context of the well-recognized testamentary exception to the privilege allowing disclosure for disputes among
the client's heirs. The court declared that the risk of posthumous revelation, when confined to the criminal context, would have little to no
chilling effect on client communication, but that the costs of protecting
communications after death were high. Concluding that the privilege
is not absolute in such circumstances, and that instead, a balancing test
should apply, the court held that there is a posthumous exception to the
privilege for communications whose relative importance to particular
criminal litigation is substantial.

Held: Hamilton's notes are protected by the attorney-client privilege.

This Court's inquiry must be guided by "the principles of the common
law . . . as interpreted by the courts . . . in light of reason and experience." Fed. Rule Evid. 501. The relevant case law demonstrates that
it has been overwhelmingly, if not universally, accepted, for well over a
century, that the privilege survives the client's death in a case such as
this. While the Independent Counsel's arguments against the privilege's posthumous survival are not frivolous, he has simply not satisfied
his burden of showing that "reason and experience" require a departure
from the common-law rule. His interpretation--that the testamentary
exception supports the privilege's posthumous termination because in
practice most cases have refused to apply the privilege posthumously;

524US2 Unit: $U92 [09-15-00 14:34:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN
400 SWIDLER & BERLIN v. UNITED STATES

Syllabus
that the exception reflects a policy judgment that the interest in settling
estates outweighs any posthumous interest in confidentiality; and that,
by analogy, the interest in determining whether a crime has been committed should trump client confidentiality, particularly since the estate's
financial interests are not at stake--does not square with the case law's
implicit acceptance of the privilege's survival and with its treatment of
testamentary disclosure as an "exception" or an implied "waiver." And
his analogy's premise is incorrect, since cases have consistently recognized that the testamentary exception furthers the client's intent,
whereas there is no reason to suppose the same is true with respect to
grand jury testimony about confidential communications. Knowing
that communications will remain confidential even after death serves a
weighty interest in encouraging a client to communicate fully and
frankly with counsel; posthumous disclosure of such communications
may be as feared as disclosure during the client's lifetime. The Independent Counsel's suggestion that a posthumous disclosure rule will
chill only clients intent on perjury, not truthful clients or those asserting the Fifth Amendment, incorrectly equates the privilege against
self-incrimination with the privilege here at issue, which serves much
broader purposes. Clients consult attorneys for a wide variety of
reasons, many of which involve confidences that are not admissions of
crime, but nonetheless are matters the clients would not wish divulged.
The suggestion that the proposed exception would have minimal impact
if confined to criminal cases, or to information of substantial importance
in particular criminal cases, is unavailing because there is no case law
holding that the privilege applies differently in criminal and civil cases,
and because a client may not know when he discloses information to his
attorney whether it will later be relevant to a civil or criminal matter,
let alone whether it will be of substantial importance. Balancing ex
post the importance of the information against client interests, even
limited to criminal cases, introduces substantial uncertainty into the
privilege's application and therefore must be rejected. The argument
that the existence of, e. g., the crime-fraud and testamentary exceptions
to the privilege makes the impact of one more exception marginal fails
because there is little empirical evidence to support it, and because the
established exceptions, unlike the proposed exception, are consistent
with the privilege's purposes. Indications in United States v. Nixon,
418 U. S. 683, 710, and Branzburg v. Hayes, 408 U. S. 665, that privileges
must be strictly construed as inconsistent with truth seeking are inapposite here, since those cases dealt with the creation of privileges not
recognized by the common law, whereas here, the Independent Counsel
seeks to narrow a well-established privilege. Pp. 403-411.

Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of theCourt.
Petitioner James Hamilton, an attorney, made notes of aninitial interview with a client shortly before the client's
death. The Government, represented by the Office of Inde-pendent Counsel, now seeks his notes for use in a criminal
investigation. We hold that the notes are protected by theattorney-client privilege.

This dispute arises out of an investigation conducted bythe Office of the Independent Counsel into whether various
individuals made false statements, obstructed justice, orcommitted other crimes during investigations of the 1993
dismissal of employees from the White House Travel Office.Vincent W. Foster, Jr., was Deputy White House Counsel when the firings occurred. In July 1993, Foster metwith petitioner Hamilton, an attorney at petitioner Swidler & Berlin, to seek legal representation concerning pos-sible congressional or other investigations of the firings.

handwritten notes. One of the first entries in the notes isthe word "Privileged." Nine days later, Foster committed

suicide.In December 1995, a federal grand jury, at the request of
the Independent Counsel, issued subpoenas to petitioners
Hamilton and Swidler & Berlin for, inter alia, Hamilton'shandwritten notes of his meeting with Foster. Petitioners

filed a motion to quash, arguing that the notes were protectedby the attorney-client privilege and by the work-product
privilege. The District Court, after examining the notes
in camera, concluded they were protected from disclosure
by both doctrines and denied enforcement of the subpoenas.

The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit
reversed. In re Sealed Case, 124 F. 3d 230 (1997). While
recognizing that most courts assume the privilege survives
death, the Court of Appeals noted that holdings actually
manifesting the posthumous force of the privilege are rare.
Instead, most judicial references to the privilege's posthumous application occur in the context of a well-recognized
exception allowing disclosure for disputes among the client's
heirs. Id., at 231-232. It further noted that most commentators support some measure of posthumous curtailment of
the privilege. Id., at 232. The Court of Appeals thought
that the risk of posthumous revelation, when confined to the
criminal context, would have little to no chilling effect on
client communication, but that the costs of protecting communications after death were high. It therefore concluded
that the privilege was not absolute in such circumstances,
and that instead, a balancing test should apply. Id., at 233-
234. It thus held that there is a posthumous exception to
the privilege for communications whose relative importance
to particular criminal litigation is substantial. Id., at 235.
While acknowledging that uncertain privileges are disfavored, Jaffee v. Redmond, 518 U. S. 1, 17-18 (1996), the Court
of Appeals determined that the uncertainty introduced by
its balancing test was insignificant in light of existing excep524US2 Unit: $U92 [09-15-00 14:34:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN

tions to the privilege. 124 F. 3d, at 235. The Court of Ap-peals also held that the notes were not protected by the

work-product privilege.The dissenting judge would have affirmed the District
Court's judgment that the attorney-client privilege pro-tected the notes.

Id., at 237. He concluded that thecommon-law rule was that the privilege survived death. He

found no persuasive reason to depart from this accepted rule,particularly given the importance of the privilege to full and
frank client communication. Id., at 237.Petitioners sought review in this Court on both the
attorney-client privilege and the work-product privilege.1We granted certiorari, 523 U. S. 1045 (1998), and we now
reverse.The attorney-client privilege is one of the oldest recognized privileges for confidential communications. Upjohn
Co. v. United States, 449 U. S. 383, 389 (1981); Hunt v. Black-burn, 128 U. S. 464, 470 (1888). The privilege is intended to

encourage "full and frank communication between attorneysand their clients and thereby promote broader public interests in the observance of law and the administration of jus-tice." Upjohn, supra, at 389. The issue presented here is
the scope of that privilege; more particularly, the extent towhich the privilege survives the death of the client. Our
interpretation of the privilege's scope is guided by "the prin-ciples of the common law . . . as interpreted by the courts
. . . in the light of reason and experience." Fed. Rule Evid.501;

Funk v. United States, 290 U. S. 371 (1933).The Independent Counsel argues that the attorney-client

privilege should not prevent disclosure of confidential com-munications where the client has died and the information is
relevant to a criminal proceeding. There is some authorityfor this position. One state appellate court,

1 Because we sustain the claim of attorney-client privilege, we do not
reach the claim of work-product privilege.

404 SWIDLER & BERLIN v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
and the Court of Appeals below have held the privilege maybe subject to posthumous exceptions in certain circumstances. In Cohen, a civil case, the court recognized thatthe privilege generally survives death, but concluded that it
could make an exception where the interest of justice was
compelling and the interest of the client in preserving theconfidence was insignificant.

Id., at 462-464, 357 A. 2d, at
692-693.But other than these two decisions, cases addressing the

existence of the privilege after death--most involving thetestamentary exception--uniformly presume the privilege
survives, even if they do not so hold. See, e. g., Mayberry
v. Indiana, 670 N. E. 2d 1262 (Ind. 1996); Morris v. Cain, 39
La. Ann. 712, 1 So. 797 (1887); People v. Modzelewski, 611
N. Y. S. 2d 22, 203 A. 2d 594 (App. Div. 1994). Several State
Supreme Court decisions expressly hold that the attorneyclient privilege extends beyond the death of the client, even
in the criminal context. See In re John Doe Grand Jury
Investigation, 408 Mass. 480, 481-483, 562 N. E. 2d 69, 70
(1990); State v. Doster, 276 S. C. 647, 650-651, 284 S. E. 2d
218, 219 (1981); State v. Macumber, 112 Ariz. 569, 571, 544
P. 2d 1084, 1086 (1976). In John Doe Grand Jury Investigation, for example, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial
Court concluded that survival of the privilege was "the clear
implication" of its early pronouncements that communications subject to the privilege could not be disclosed at any
time. 408 Mass., at 483, 562 N. E. 2d, at 70. The court further noted that survival of the privilege was "necessarily
implied" by cases allowing waiver of the privilege in testamentary disputes. Ibid.

Such testamentary exception cases consistently presume
the privilege survives. See, e. g., United States v. Osborn,
561 F. 2d 1334, 1340 (CA9 1977); DeLoach v. Myers, 215 Ga.
255, 259-260, 109 S. E. 2d 777, 780-781 (1959); Doyle v.

mentary disclosure of communications as an exception to theprivilege: "[T]he general rule with respect to confidential

communications . . . is that such communications are privi-leged during the testator's lifetime and, also, after the testator's death unless sought to be disclosed in litigation betweenthe testator's heirs."

Osborn, 561 F. 2d, at 1340. The ra-tionale for such disclosure is that it furthers the client's intent. Id., at 1340, n. 11.2Indeed, in Glover v. Patten, 165 U. S. 394, 406-408 (1897),
this Court, in recognizing the testamentary exception,expressly assumed that the privilege continues after the
individual's death. The Court explained that testamentarydisclosure was permissible because the privilege, which
normally protects the client's interests, could be impliedlywaived in order to fulfill the client's testamentary intent.
Id., at 407-408 (quoting Blackburn v. Crawfords, 3 Wall. 175(1866), and

Russell v. Jackson, supra).The great body of this case law supports, either by holding

or considered dicta, the position that the privilege does sur-vive in a case such as the present one. Given the language
of Rule 501, at the very least the burden is on the Independ2 About half the States have codified the testamentary exception by providing that a personal representative of the deceased can waive the privilege when heirs or devisees claim through the deceased client (as opposed
to parties claiming against the estate, for whom the privilege is not
waived). See, e. g., Ala. Rule Evid. 502 (1996); Ark. Code Ann. $ 16-41-
101, Rule 502 (Supp. 1997); Neb. Rev. Stat. $ 27-503, Rule 503 (1995).
These statutes do not address expressly the continuation of the privilege
outside the context of testamentary disputes, although many allow the
attorney to assert the privilege on behalf of the client apparently without
temporal limit. See, e. g., Ark. Code Ann. $ 16-41-101, Rule 502(c) (Supp.
1997). They thus do not refute or affirm the general presumption in the
case law that the privilege survives. California's statute is exceptional in
that it apparently allows the attorney to assert the privilege only so long
as a holder of the privilege (the estate's personal representative) exists,
suggesting the privilege terminates when the estate is wound up. See
Cal. Code Evid. Ann. $$ 954, 957 (West 1995). But no other State has
followed California's lead in this regard.

Opinion of the Court
ent Counsel to show that "reason and experience" require adeparture from this rule.

The Independent Counsel contends that the testamentaryexception supports the posthumous termination of the privilege because in practice most cases have refused to apply the
privilege posthumously. He further argues that the excep-tion reflects a policy judgment that the interest in settling

estates outweighs any posthumous interest in confidentiality.He then reasons by analogy that in criminal proceedings, the
interest in determining whether a crime has been committedshould trump client confidentiality, particularly since the financial interests of the estate are not at stake.

But the Independent Counsel's interpretation simply does
not square with the case law's implicit acceptance of the privilege's survival and with the treatment of testamentary disclosure as an "exception" or an implied "waiver." And the
premise of his analogy is incorrect, since cases consistently
recognize that the rationale for the testamentary exception
is that it furthers the client's intent, see, e. g., Glover, supra.
There is no reason to suppose as a general matter that grand
jury testimony about confidential communications furthers
the client's intent.

Commentators on the law also recognize that the general
rule is that the attorney-client privilege continues after
death. See, e. g., 8 Wigmore, Evidence $ 2323 (McNaughton
rev. 1961); Frankel, The Attorney-Client Privilege After the
Death of the Client, 6 Geo. J. Legal Ethics 45, 78-79 (1992); 1
J. Strong, McCormick on Evidence $ 94, p. 348 (4th ed. 1992).
Undoubtedly, as the Independent Counsel emphasizes, various commentators have criticized this rule, urging that the
privilege should be abrogated after the client's death where
extreme injustice would result, as long as disclosure would
not seriously undermine the privilege by deterring client
communication. See, e. g., C. Mueller & L. Kirkpatrick, 2
Federal Evidence $ 199, pp. 380-381 (2d ed. 1994); Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers $ 127, Comment

Opinion of the Court
d (Proposed Final Draft No. 1, Mar. 29, 1996). But eventhese critics clearly recognize that established law supports

the continuation of the privilege and that a contrary rulewould be a modification of the common law. See,

e. g., Mueller & Kirkpatrick, supra, at 379; Restatement of the Law
Governing Lawyers, supra, $ 127, Comment c; 24 C. Wright& K. Graham, Federal Practice and Procedure $ 5498, p. 483

(1986).Despite the scholarly criticism, we think there are weighty
reasons that counsel in favor of posthumous application.Knowing that communications will remain confidential even
after death encourages the client to communicate fully and
frankly with counsel. While the fear of disclosure, and the
consequent withholding of information from counsel, may be
reduced if disclosure is limited to posthumous disclosure in
a criminal context, it seems unreasonable to assume that it
vanishes altogether. Clients may be concerned about reputation, civil liability, or possible harm to friends or family.
Posthumous disclosure of such communications may be as
feared as disclosure during the client's lifetime.

The Independent Counsel suggests, however, that his proposed exception would have little to no effect on the client's
willingness to confide in his attorney. He reasons that only
clients intending to perjure themselves will be chilled by a
rule of disclosure after death, as opposed to truthful clients
or those asserting their Fifth Amendment privilege. This
is because for the latter group, communications disclosed by
the attorney after the client's death purportedly will reveal
only information that the client himself would have revealed
if alive.

The Independent Counsel assumes, incorrectly we believe,
that the privilege is analogous to the Fifth Amendment's
protection against self-incrimination. But as suggested
above, the privilege serves much broader purposes. Clients
consult attorneys for a wide variety of reasons, only one of
which involves possible criminal liability. Many attorneys

Opinion of the Court
act as counselors on personal and family matters, where, inthe course of obtaining the desired advice, confidences about

family members or financial problems must be revealed inorder to assure sound legal advice. The same is true of owners of small businesses who may regularly consult their at-torneys about a variety of problems arising in the course of
the business. These confidences may not come close to anysort of admission of criminal wrongdoing, but nonetheless be
matters which the client would not wish divulged.The contention that the attorney is being required to disclose only what the client could have been required to dis-close is at odds with the basis for the privilege even during
the client's lifetime. In related cases, we have said that theloss of evidence admittedly caused by the privilege is justified in part by the fact that without the privilege, the clientmay not have made such communications in the first place.
See Jaffee, 518 U. S., at 12; Fisher v. United States, 425 U. S.391, 403 (1976). This is true of disclosure before and after
the client's death. Without assurance of the privilege's post-humous application, the client may very well not have made
disclosures to his attorney at all, so the loss of evidence ismore apparent than real. In the case at hand, it seems quite
plausible that Foster, perhaps already contemplating suicide,may not have sought legal advice from Hamilton if he had
not been assured the conversation was privileged.The Independent Counsel additionally suggests that his
proposed exception would have minimal impact if confined tocriminal cases, or, as the Court of Appeals suggests, if it is
limited to information of substantial importance to a particu-lar criminal case.

3 However, there is no case authority for

the proposition that the privilege applies differently in crimi3 Petitioners, while opposing wholesale abrogation of the privilege in
criminal cases, concede that exceptional circumstances implicating a criminal defendant's constitutional rights might warrant breaching the privilege. We do not, however, need to reach this issue, since such exceptional
circumstances clearly are not presented here.

nal and civil cases, and only one commentator ventures sucha suggestion, see Mueller & Kirkpatrick,

supra, at 380-381.
In any event, a client may not know at the time he disclosesinformation to his attorney whether it will later be relevant

to a civil or a criminal matter, let alone whether it will be of
substantial importance. Balancing ex post the importanceof the information against client interests, even limited to

criminal cases, introduces substantial uncertainty into theprivilege's application. For just that reason, we have rejected use of a balancing test in defining the contours of theprivilege. See

Upjohn, 449 U. S., at 393; Jaffee, supra, at
17-18.In a similar vein, the Independent Counsel argues that

existing exceptions to the privilege, such as the crime-fraud
exception and the testamentary exception, make the impactof one more exception marginal. However, these exceptions

do not demonstrate that the impact of a posthumous exception would be insignificant, and there is little empirical evidence on this point.4 The established exceptions are con4 Empirical evidence on the privilege is limited. Three studies do not
reach firm conclusions on whether limiting the privilege would discourage
full and frank communication. Alexander, The Corporate Attorney Client
Privilege: A Study of the Participants, 63 St. John's L. Rev. 191 (1989);
Zacharias, Rethinking Confidentiality, 74 Iowa L. Rev. 352 (1989); Comment, Functional Overlap Between the Lawyer and Other Professionals:
Its Implications for the Privileged Communications Doctrine, 71 Yale L. J.
1226 (1962). These articles note that clients are often uninformed or mistaken about the privilege, but suggest that a substantial number of clients
and attorneys think the privilege encourages candor. Two of the articles
conclude that a substantial number of clients and attorneys think the privilege enhances open communication, Alexander, supra, at 244-246, 261, and
that the absence of a privilege would be detrimental to such communication, Comment, 71 Yale L. J., supra, at 1236. The third article suggests
instead that while the privilege is perceived as important to open communication, limited exceptions to the privilege might not discourage
such communication, Zacharias, supra, at 382, 386. Similarly, relatively
few court decisions discuss the impact of the privilege's application after
death. This may reflect the general assumption that the privilege sur524US2 Unit: $U92 [09-15-00 14:34:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
sistent with the purposes of the privilege, see Glover, 165U. S., at 407-408; United States v. Zolin, 491 U. S. 554, 562-

563 (1989), while a posthumous exception in criminal casesappears at odds with the goals of encouraging full and frank
communication and of protecting the client's interests. A"no harm in one more exception" rationale could contribute
to the general erosion of the privilege, without reference tocommon-law principles or "reason and experience."

Finally, the Independent Counsel, relying on cases such as
United States v. Nixon, 418 U. S. 683, 710 (1974), and Branz-burg v. Hayes, 408 U. S. 665 (1972), urges that privileges be

strictly construed because they are inconsistent with theparamount judicial goal of truth seeking. But both

Nixonand Branzburg dealt with the creation of privileges not recognized by the common law, whereas here we deal with oneof the oldest recognized privileges in the law. And we are
asked, not simply to "construe" the privilege, but to narrowit, contrary to the weight of the existing body of case law.

It has been generally, if not universally, accepted, for wellover a century, that the attorney-client privilege survives
the death of the client in a case such as this. While thearguments against the survival of the privilege are by no
means frivolous, they are based in large part on specula-tion--thoughtful speculation, but speculation nonetheless--
as to whether posthumous termination of the privilege woulddiminish a client's willingness to confide in an attorney. In
an area where empirical information would be useful, it isscant and inconclusive.

Rule 501's direction to look to "the principles of the com-mon law as they may be interpreted by the courts of the
United States in the light of reason and experience" does notmandate that a rule, once established, should endure for all
time. Funk v. United States, 290 U. S. 371, 381 (1933). But
vives--if attorneys were required as a matter of practice to testify or
provide notes in criminal proceedings, cases discussing that practice would
surely exist.

here the Independent Counsel has simply not made a suffi-cient showing to overturn the common-law rule embodied in

the prevailing case law. Interpreted in the light of reasonand experience, that body of law requires that the attorneyclient privilege prevent disclosure of the notes at issue inthis case. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is

Reversed.
Justice O'Connor, with whom Justice Scalia and
Justice Thomas join, dissenting.

Although the attorney-client privilege ordinarily will sur-vive the death of the client, I do not agree with the Court

that it inevitably precludes disclosure of a deceased client'scommunications in criminal proceedings. In my view, a
criminal defendant's right to exculpatory evidence or a com-pelling law enforcement need for information may, where the
testimony is not available from other sources, override a cli-ent's posthumous interest in confidentiality.

We have long recognized that "[t]he fundamental basisupon which all rules of evidence must rest--if they are to
rest upon reason--is their adaptation to the successful devel-opment of the truth."

Funk v. United States, 290 U. S. 371,381 (1933). In light of the heavy burden that they place on

the search for truth, see United States v. Nixon, 418 U. S.683, 708-710 (1974), "[e]videntiary privileges in litigation are
not favored, and even those rooted in the Constitution must
give way in proper circumstances," Herbert v. Lando, 441U. S. 153, 175 (1979). Consequently, we construe the scope

of privileges narrowly. See Jaffee v. Redmond, 518 U. S. 1,
19 (1996) (Scalia, J., dissenting); see also University of
Pennsylvania v. EEOC, 493 U. S. 182, 189 (1990). We are
reluctant to recognize a privilege or read an existing oneexpansively unless to do so will serve a "public good transcending the normally predominant principle of utilizing allrational means for ascertaining truth."

States, 445 U. S. 40, 50 (1980) (internal quotation marksomitted).

The attorney-client privilege promotes trust in the repre-sentational relationship, thereby facilitating the provision of
legal services and ultimately the administration of justice.
See Upjohn Co. v. United States, 449 U. S. 383, 389 (1981).The systemic benefits of the privilege are commonly understood to outweigh the harm caused by excluding critical evi-dence. A privilege should operate, however, only where
"necessary to achieve its purpose," see Fisher v. United
States, 425 U. S. 391, 403 (1976), and an invocation of the
attorney-client privilege should not go unexamined "when it
is shown that the interests of the administration of justice
can only be frustrated by [its] exercise," Cohen v. Jenkintown Cab Co., 238 Pa. Super. 456, 464, 357 A. 2d 689, 693-
694 (1976).

I agree that a deceased client may retain a personal, reputational, and economic interest in confidentiality. See ante,
at 407. But, after death, the potential that disclosure will
harm the client's interests has been greatly diminished, and
the risk that the client will be held criminally liable has
abated altogether. Thus, some commentators suggest that
terminating the privilege upon the client's death "could not
to any substantial degree lessen the encouragement for free
disclosure which is [its] purpose." 1 J. Strong, McCormick
on Evidence $ 94, p. 350 (4th ed. 1992); see also Restatement
(Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers $ 127, Comment d
(Proposed Final Draft No. 1, Mar. 29, 1996). This diminished risk is coupled with a heightened urgency for discovery
of a deceased client's communications in the criminal context.
The privilege does not "protect disclosure of the underlying
facts by those who communicated with the attorney," Upjohn, supra, at 395, and were the client living, prosecutors
could grant immunity and compel the relevant testimony.
After a client's death, however, if the privilege precludes an
attorney from testifying in the client's stead, a complete

O'Connor, J., dissenting
"loss of crucial information" will often result, see 24 C.
Wright & K. Graham, Federal Practice and Procedure $ 5498,
p. 484 (1986).

As the Court of Appeals observed, the costs of recognizing
an absolute posthumous privilege can be inordinately high.
See In re Sealed Case, 124 F. 3d 230, 233-234 (CADC 1997).
Extreme injustice may occur, for example, where a criminal
defendant seeks disclosure of a deceased client's confession
to the offense. See State v. Macumber, 112 Ariz. 569, 571,
544 P. 2d 1084, 1086 (1976); cf. In the Matter of a John Doe
Grand Jury Investigation, 408 Mass. 480, 486, 562 N. E. 2d
69, 72 (1990) (Nolan, J., dissenting). In my view, the paramount value that our criminal justice system places on protecting an innocent defendant should outweigh a deceased
client's interest in preserving confidences. See, e. g., Schlup
v. Delo, 513 U. S. 298, 324-325 (1995); In re Winship, 397
U. S. 358, 371 (1970) (Harlan, J., concurring). Indeed, even
petitioners acknowledge that an exception may be appropriate where the constitutional rights of a criminal defendant
are at stake. An exception may likewise be warranted in
the face of a compelling law enforcement need for the information. "[O]ur historic commitment to the rule of law . . .
is nowhere more profoundly manifest than in our view that
the twofold aim of criminal justice is that guilt shall not escape or innocence suffer." Nixon, supra, at 709 (internal
quotation marks omitted); see also Herrera v. Collins, 506
U. S. 390, 398 (1993). Given that the complete exclusion of
relevant evidence from a criminal trial or investigation may
distort the record, mislead the factfinder, and undermine the
central truth-seeking function of the courts, I do not believe
that the attorney-client privilege should act as an absolute
bar to the disclosure of a deceased client's communications.
When the privilege is asserted in the criminal context, and
a showing is made that the communications at issue contain
necessary factual information not otherwise available, courts

414 SWIDLER & BERLIN v. UNITED STATES

O'Connor, J., dissenting
should be permitted to assess whether interests in fairnessand accuracy outweigh the justifications for the privilege.

A number of exceptions to the privilege already qualify itsprotections, and an attorney "who tells his client that the
expected communications are absolutely and forever privileged is oversimplifying a bit." 124 F. 3d, at 235. In thesituation where the posthumous privilege most frequently

arises--a dispute between heirs over the decedent's will--the privilege is widely recognized to give way to the interest
in settling the estate. See Glover v. Patten, 165 U. S. 394,406-408 (1897). This testamentary exception, moreover,
may be invoked in some cases where the decedent would not
have chosen to waive the privilege. For example, "a decedent might want to provide for an illegitimate child but at
the same time much prefer that the relationship go undisclosed." 124 F. 3d, at 234. Among the Court's rationales
for a broad construction of the posthumous privilege is its
assertion that "[m]any attorneys act as counselors on personal and family matters, where, in the course of obtaining
the desired advice, confidences about family members or
financial problems must be revealed . . . which the client
would not wish divulged." Ante, at 407-408. That reasoning, however, would apply in the testamentary context
with equal force. Nor are other existing exceptions to the
privilege--for example, the crime-fraud exception or the
exceptions for claims relating to attorney competence or
compensation--necessarily consistent with "encouraging full
and frank communication" or "protecting the client's interests." Ante, at 410. Rather, those exceptions reflect the
understanding that, in certain circumstances, the privilege
" `ceases to operate' " as a safeguard on "the proper functioning of our adversary system." See United States v. Zolin,
491 U. S. 554, 562-563 (1989).

Finally, the common law authority for the proposition that
the privilege remains absolute after the client's death is not
a monolithic body of precedent. Indeed, the Court acknowl524US2 Unit: $U92 [09-15-00 14:34:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN

415Cite as: 524 U. S. 399 (1998)
O'Connor, J., dissenting
edges that most cases merely "presume the privilege sur-vives," see

ante, at 404, and it relies on the case law's "implicit acceptance" of a continuous privilege, see ante, at 406.Opinions squarely addressing the posthumous force of the

privilege "are relatively rare." See 124 F. 3d, at 232. And
even in those decisions expressly holding that the privilegecontinues after the death of the client, courts do not typically

engage in detailed reasoning, but rather conclude that thecases construing the testamentary exception imply survival
of the privilege. See, e. g., Glover, supra, at 406-408; seealso Wright & Graham,

supra, $ 5498, at 484 ("Those who
favor an eternal duration for the privilege seldom do much
by way of justifying this in terms of policy").

Moreover, as the Court concedes, see ante, at 403-404,
406-407, there is some authority for the proposition that

a deceased client's communications may be revealed, even
in circumstances outside of the testamentary context. California's Evidence Code, for example, provides that the
attorney-client privilege continues only until the deceased
client's estate is finally distributed, noting that "there is little
reason to preserve secrecy at the expense of excluding relevant evidence after the estate is wound up and the representative is discharged." Cal. Evid. Code Ann. $ 954, and
comment, p. 232, $ 952 (West 1995). And a state appellate
court has admitted an attorney's testimony concerning a deceased client's communications after "balanc[ing] the necessity for revealing the substance of the [attorney-client conversation] against the unlikelihood of any cognizable injury
to the rights, interests, estate or memory of [the client]."
See Cohen, supra, at 464, 357 A. 2d, at 693. The American
Law Institute, moreover, has recently recommended withholding the privilege when the communication "bears on
a litigated issue of pivotal significance" and has suggested
that courts "balance the interest in confidentiality against

any exceptional need for the communication." Restatement

confessed to criminal acts that are later charged to another,surely the latter's need for evidence sometimes outweighs
the interest in preserving the confidences").Where the exoneration of an innocent criminal defendant
or a compelling law enforcement interest is at stake, theharm of precluding critical evidence that is unavailable by
any other means outweighs the potential disincentive toforthright communication. In my view, the cost of silence
warrants a narrow exception to the rule that the attorney-client privilege survives the death of the client. Moreover,
although I disagree with the Court of Appeals' notion thatthe context of an initial client interview affects the applicability of the work product doctrine, I do not believe that thedoctrine applies where the material concerns a client who is
no longer a potential party to adversarial litigation.Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of
Appeals. Although the District Court examined the docu-ments

in camera, it has not had an opportunity to balancethese competing considerations and decide whether the privilege should be trumped in the particular circumstances ofthis case. Thus, I agree with the Court of Appeals' decision
to remand for a determination whether any portion of thenotes must be disclosed.

With respect, I dissent.

CLINTON, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,

et al. v. CITY OF NEW YORK et al.

appeal from the united states district court for thedistrict of columbia

No. 97-1374. Argued April 27, 1998--Decided June 25, 1998
Last Term, this Court determined on expedited review that Members of

Congress did not have standing to maintain a constitutional challenge
to the Line Item Veto Act (Act), 2 U. S. C. $ 691 et seq., because they
had not alleged a sufficiently concrete injury. Raines v. Byrd, 521 U. S.
811. Within two months, the President exercised his authority under
the Act by canceling $ 4722(c) of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, which
waived the Federal Government's statutory right to recoupment of as
much as $2.6 billion in taxes that the State of New York had levied
against Medicaid providers, and $ 968 of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997,
which permitted the owners of certain food refiners and processors to
defer recognition of capital gains if they sold their stock to eligible farmers' cooperatives. Appellees, claiming they had been injured, filed separate actions against the President and other officials challenging the
cancellations. The plaintiffs in the first case are the City of New York,
two hospital associations, one hospital, and two unions representing
health care employees. The plaintiffs in the second are the Snake
River farmers' cooperative and one of its individual members. The District Court consolidated the cases, determined that at least one of the
plaintiffs in each had standing under Article III, and ruled, inter alia,
that the Act's cancellation procedures violate the Presentment Clause,
Art. I, $ 7, cl. 2. This Court again expedited its review.

Held:

1. The appellees have standing to challenge the Act's constitutionality. They invoked the District Court's jurisdiction under a section entitled "Expedited review," which, among other things, expressly authorizes "any individual adversely affected" to bring a constitutional
challenge. $ 692(a)(1). The Government's argument that none of them
except the individual Snake River member is an "individual" within

$ 692(a)(1)'s meaning is rejected because, in the context of the entire
section, it is clear that Congress meant that word to be construed
broadly to include corporations and other entities. The Court is also
unpersuaded by the Government's argument that appellees' challenge is
nonjusticiable. These cases differ from Raines, not only because the
President's exercise of his cancellation authority has removed any con524US2 Unit: $U93 [09-11-00 13:25:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN

cern about the dispute's ripeness, but more importantly because the
parties have alleged a "personal stake" in having an actual injury redressed, rather than an "institutional injury" that is "abstract and
widely dispersed." 521 U. S., at 829. There is no merit to the Government's contention that, in both cases, the appellees have not suffered
actual injury because their claims are too speculative and, in any event,
are advanced by the wrong parties. Because New York State now has
a multibillion dollar contingent liability that had been eliminated by

$ 4722(c), the State, and the appellees, suffered an immediate, concrete
injury the moment the President canceled the section and deprived
them of its benefits. The argument that New York's claim belongs to
the State, not appellees, fails in light of New York statutes demonstrating that both New York City and the appellee providers will be assessed
for substantial portions of any recoupment payments the State has to
make. Similarly, the President's cancellation of $ 968 inflicted a sufficient likelihood of economic injury on the Snake River appellees to establish standing under this Court's precedents, cf. Bryant v. Yellen, 447
U. S. 352, 368. The assertion that, because processing facility sellers
would have received the tax benefits, only they have standing to challenge the $ 968 cancellation not only ignores the fact that the cooperatives were the intended beneficiaries of $ 968, but also overlooks the fact
that more than one party may be harmed by a defendant and therefore
have standing. Pp. 428-436.

2. The Act's cancellation procedures violate the Presentment Clause.
Pp. 436-449.

(a) The Act empowers the President to cancel an "item of new direct spending" such as $ 4722(c) of the Balanced Budget Act and a "limited tax benefit" such as $ 968 of the Taxpayer Relief Act, $ 691(a), specifying that such cancellation prevents a provision "from having legal
force or effect," $$ 691e(4)(B)-(C). Thus, in both legal and practical effect, the Presidential actions at issue have amended two Acts of Congress by repealing a portion of each. Statutory repeals must conform
with Art. I, INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S. 919, 954, but there is no constitutional authorization for the President to amend or repeal. Under the
Presentment Clause, after a bill has passed both Houses, but "before it
become[s] a Law," it must be presented to the President, who "shall sign
it" if he approves it, but "return it," i. e., "veto" it, if he does not. There
are important differences between such a "return" and cancellation
under the Act: The constitutional return is of the entire bill and takes
place before it becomes law, whereas the statutory cancellation occurs
after the bill becomes law and affects it only in part. There are powerful reasons for construing the constitutional silence on the profoundly
important subject of Presidential repeals as equivalent to an express

Syllabus
prohibition. The Article I procedures governing statutory enactment
were the product of the great debates and compromises that produced
the Constitution itself. Familiar historical materials provide abundant
support for the conclusion that the power to enact statutes may only
"be exercised in accord with a single, finely wrought and exhaustively
considered, procedure." Chadha, 462 U. S., at 951. What has emerged
in the present cases, however, are not the product of the "finely
wrought" procedure that the Framers designed, but truncated versions
of two bills that passed both Houses. Pp. 436-441.

(b) The Court rejects two related Government arguments. First,
the contention that the cancellations were merely exercises of the President's discretionary authority under the Balanced Budget Act and the
Taxpayer Relief Act, read in light of the previously enacted Line Item
Veto Act, is unpersuasive. Field v. Clark, 143 U. S. 649, 693, on which
the Government relies, suggests critical differences between this cancellation power and the President's statutory power to suspend import
duty exemptions that was there upheld: such suspension was contingent
on a condition that did not predate its statute, the duty to suspend was
absolute once the President determined the contingency had arisen, and
the suspension executed congressional policy. In contrast, the Act at
issue authorizes the President himself to effect the repeal of laws, for
his own policy reasons, without observing Article I, $ 7, procedures.
Second, the contention that the cancellation authority is no greater than
the President's traditional statutory authority to decline to spend appropriated funds or to implement specified tax measures fails because this
Act, unlike the earlier laws, gives the President the unilateral power to
change the text of duly enacted statutes. Pp. 442-447.

(c) The profound importance of these cases makes it appropriate to
emphasize three points. First, the Court expresses no opinion about
the wisdom of the Act's procedures and does not lightly conclude that
the actions of the Congress that passed it, and the President who signed
it into law, were unconstitutional. The Court has, however, twice had
full argument and briefing on the question and has concluded that its
duty is clear. Second, having concluded that the Act's cancellation provisions violate Article I, $ 7, the Court finds it unnecessary to consider
the District Court's alternative holding that the Act impermissibly disrupts the balance of powers among the three branches of Government.
Third, this decision rests on the narrow ground that the Act's procedures are not authorized by the Constitution. If this Act were valid, it
would authorize the President to create a law whose text was not voted
on by either House or presented to the President for signature. That
may or may not be desirable, but it is surely not a document that may
"become a law" pursuant to Article I, $ 7. If there is to be a new proce524US2 Unit: $U93 [09-11-00 13:25:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN

brought suit in the District Court for the District of Colum-bia challenging its constitutionality. On April 10, 1997, the
District Court entered an order holding that the Act is un-constitutional.

Byrd v. Raines, 956 F. Supp. 25. In obedi-ence to the statutory direction to allow a direct, expedited

appeal to this Court, see $$ 692(b)-(c), we promptly notedprobable jurisdiction and expedited review, 520 U. S. 1194

Raines v. Byrd, 521 U. S. 811, 830 (1997);thus, "[i]n . . . light of [the] overriding and time-honored concern about keeping the Judiciary's power within its properconstitutional sphere," id., at 820, we remanded the case to
the District Court with instructions to dismiss the complaintfor lack of jurisdiction.

Less than two months after our decision in that case, thePresident exercised his authority to cancel one provision in
the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, Pub. L. 105-33, 111 Stat.251, 515, and two provisions in the Taxpayer Relief Act of
1997, Pub. L. 105-34, 111 Stat. 788, 895-896, 990-993. Ap-pellees, claiming that they had been injured by two of those
cancellations, filed these cases in the District Court. ThatCourt again held the statute invalid, 985 F. Supp. 168, 177-

Opinion of the Court
Section 4722(c) of the Balanced Budget Act

Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 79 Stat. 343, asamended, authorizes the Federal Government to transfer

huge sums of money to the States to help finance medicalcare for the indigent. See 42 U. S. C. $ 1396d(b). In 1991,
Congress directed that those federal subsidies be reduced bythe amount of certain taxes levied by the States on health
care providers.1 In 1994, the Department of Health andHuman Services (HHS) notified the State of New York that
15 of its taxes were covered by the 1991 Act, and that as ofJune 30, 1994, the statute therefore required New York to
return $955 million to the United States. The notice ad-vised the State that it could apply for a waiver on certain
statutory grounds. New York did request a waiver forthose tax programs, as well as for a number of others, but
HHS has not formally acted on any of those waiver requests.New York has estimated that the amount at issue for the
period from October 1992 through March 1997 is as high as$2.6 billion.

Because HHS had not taken any action on the waiver re-quests, New York turned to Congress for relief. On August
5, 1997, Congress enacted a law that resolved the issue inNew York's favor. Section 4722(c) of the Balanced Budget
Act of 1997 identifies the disputed taxes and provides thatthey "are deemed to be permissible health care related taxes
and in compliance with the requirements" of the relevantprovisions of the 1991 statute.

Opinion of the Court
On August 11, 1997, the President sent identical notices tothe Senate and to the House of Representatives canceling

"one item of new direct spending," specifying $ 4722(c) asthat item, and stating that he had determined that "this
cancellation will reduce the Federal budget deficit." Heexplained that $ 4722(c) would have permitted New York
"to continue relying upon impermissible provider taxes tofinance its Medicaid program" and that "[t]his preferential
treatment would have increased Medicaid costs, would havetreated New York differently from all other States, and
would have established a costly precedent for other Statesto request comparable treatment."

Section 968 of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997

A person who realizes a profit from the sale of securitiesis generally subject to a capital gains tax. Under existing

law, however, an ordinary business corporation can acquirea corporation, including a food processing or refining company, in a merger or stock-for-stock transaction in which nogain is recognized to the seller, see 26 U. S. C. $$ 354(a),
368(a); the seller's tax payment, therefore, is deferred. If,however, the purchaser is a farmers' cooperative, the parties
cannot structure such a transaction because the stock of thecooperative may be held only by its members, see $ 521(b)(2);
thus, a seller dealing with a farmers' cooperative cannot ob-tain the benefits of tax deferral.

a waiver be applied for, in accordance with subparagraph (E) of such section, and, (if so applied for) upon which action by the Secretary of Health
and Human Services (including any judicial review of any such proceeding)
has not been completed as of July 23, 1997, are deemed to be permissible

Opinion of the Court
In $ 968 of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, Congressamended $ 1042 of the Internal Revenue Code to permit owners of certain food refiners and processors to defer the rec-ognition of gain if they sell their stock to eligible farmers'
cooperatives.4 The purpose of the amendment, as repeat-edly explained by its sponsors, was "to facilitate the transfer
of refiners and processors to farmers' cooperatives." 5 The

4 Section 968(a) of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 amended 26 U. S. C.

$ 1042 by adding a new subsection (g), which defined the sellers eligible
for the exemption as follows:

"(2) QUALIFIED REFINER OR PROCESSOR.--For purposes of this
subsection, the term `qualified refiner or processor' means a domestic
corporation--

"(A) substantially all of the activities of which consist of the active
conduct of the trade or business of refining or processing agricultural or
horticultural products, and

"(B) which, during the 1-year period ending on the date of the sale,
purchases more than one-half of such products to be refined or processed
from--

"(i) farmers who make up the eligible farmers' cooperative which is purchasing stock in the corporation in a transaction to which this subsection
is to apply, or

"(ii) such cooperative." 111 Stat. 896.

stating that it "would provide farmers who form farmers cooperatives the
opportunity for an ownership interest in the processing and marketing of
their products"); ibid. (Senator Craig, cosponsor of a previous bill, stating
that "[c]urrently, farmers cannot compete with other business entities . . .

raw commodities into value-added products. . . . It will encourage farmers
to help themselves in a more market-oriented environment by vertically
integrating. If this legislation is passed, we are confident that, 10 years
from now, we will look on this bill as one of the most beneficial actions
Congress took for U. S. farmers").

amendment to $ 1042 was one of the 79 "limited tax benefits"authorized by the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 and specifically identified in Title XVII of that Act as "subject to [the]line item veto."

On the same date that he canceled the "item of new directspending" involving New York's health care programs, the

President also canceled this limited tax benefit. In his ex-planation of that action, the President endorsed the objective
of encouraging "value-added farming through the purchaseby farmers' cooperatives of refiners or processors of agricultural goods," 7 but concluded that the provision lacked safe-guards and also "failed to target its benefits to small-andmedium-size cooperatives." 8

Appellees filed two separate actions against the President 9and other federal officials challenging these two cancellations. The plaintiffs in the first case are the City of NewYork, two hospital associations, one hospital, and two unions
representing health care employees. The plaintiffs in thesecond are a farmers' cooperative consisting of about 30 potato growers in Idaho and an individual farmer who is amember and officer of the cooperative. The District Court

that creating incentives so that farmers' cooperatives can obtain processing facilities is a "very worthy goal." Id., at 130.

Line Item Veto Act is unconstitutional and that the particular cancellation
was invalid; neither set of plaintiffs sought injunctive relief against the
President.

of the plaintiffs in each had standing under Article III ofthe Constitution.

Appellee New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation(NYCHHC) is responsible for the operation of public health
care facilities throughout the City of New York. If HHSultimately denies the State's waiver requests, New York law
will automatically require 10 NYCHHC to make retroactivetax payments to the State of about $4 million for each of the
years at issue. 985 F. Supp., at 172. This contingent liabil-ity for NYCHHC, and comparable potential liabilities for the
other appellee health care providers, were eliminated by$ 4722(c) of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and revived by
the President's cancellation of that provision. The DistrictCourt held that the cancellation of the statutory protection
against these liabilities constituted sufficient injury to givethese providers Article III standing.

Appellee Snake River Potato Growers, Inc. (Snake River)was formed in May 1997 to assist Idaho potato farmers in
marketing their crops and stabilizing prices, in part througha strategy of acquiring potato processing facilities that will
allow the members of the cooperative to retain revenuesotherwise payable to third-party processors. At that time,
Congress was considering the amendment to the capitalgains tax that was expressly intended to aid farmers' cooperatives in the purchase of processing facilities, and SnakeRiver had concrete plans to take advantage of the amendment if passed. Indeed, appellee Mike Cranney, acting onbehalf of Snake River, was engaged in negotiations with the

owner of an Idaho potato processor that would have qualifiedfor the tax benefit under the pending legislation, but these

negotiations terminated when the President canceled $ 968.Snake River is currently considering the possible purchase
of other processing facilities in Idaho if the President's can-cellation is reversed. Based on these facts, the District
Court concluded that the Snake River plaintiffs were injuredby the President's cancellation of $ 968, as they "lost the benefit of being on equal footing with their competitors and willlikely have to pay more to purchase processing facilities now
that the sellers will not [be] able to take advantage of section968's tax breaks."

Id., at 177.On the merits, the District Court held that the cancellations did not conform to the constitutionally mandated proce-dures for the enactment or repeal of laws in two respects.
First, the laws that resulted after the cancellations "weredifferent from those consented to by both Houses of Congress." Id., at 178.11 Moreover, the President violatedArticle I "when he unilaterally canceled provisions of duly
enacted statutes." Id., at 179.12 As a separate basis for

11 As the District Court explained: "These laws reflected the best judgment of both Houses. The laws that resulted after the President's line
item veto were different from those consented to by both Houses of Congress. There is no way of knowing whether these laws, in their truncated
form, would have received the requisite support from both the House and
the Senate. Because the laws that emerged after the Line Item Veto are
not the same laws that proceeded through the legislative process, as required, the resulting laws are not valid." 985 F. Supp., at 178-179.

12 "Unilateral action by any single participant in the law-making process

is precisely what the Bicameralism and Presentment Clauses were designed to prevent. Once a bill becomes law, it can only be repealed or
amended through another, independent legislative enactment, which itself
must conform with the requirements of Article I. Any rescissions must
be agreed upon by a majority of both Houses of Congress. The President
cannot single-handedly revise the work of the other two participants in
the lawmaking process, as he did here when he vetoed certain provisions
of these statutes." Ibid.

Opinion of the Court
its decision, the District Court also held that the Act "imper-missibly disrupts the balance of powers among the three

branches of government." Ibid.

III
As in the prior challenge to the Line Item Veto Act, weinitially confront jurisdictional questions. The appellees invoked the jurisdiction of the District Court under the sectionof the Act entitled "Expedited review." That section, 2
U. S. C. $ 692(a)(1) (1994 ed., Supp. II), expressly authorizes"[a]ny Member of Congress or any individual adversely affected" by the Act to bring an action for declaratory judg-ment or injunctive relief on the ground that any provision of
the Act is unconstitutional. Although the Government didnot question the applicability of that section in the District
Court, it now argues that, with the exception of Mike Cran-ney, the appellees are not "individuals" within the meaning
of $ 692(a)(1). Because the argument poses a jurisdictionalquestion (although not one of constitutional magnitude), it is
not waived by the failure to raise it in the District Court.The fact that the argument did not previously occur to the
able lawyers for the Government does, however, confirm ourview that in the context of the entire section Congress undoubtedly intended the word "individual" to be construed assynonymous with the word "person."

13

The special section authorizing expedited review evi-dences an unmistakable congressional interest in a prompt

and authoritative judicial determination of the constitution13 Although in ordinary usage both "individual" and "person" often refer
to an individual human being, see, e. g., Webster's Third New International
Dictionary 1152, 1686 (1986) ("individual" defined as a "single human
being"; "person" defined as "an individual human being"), "person" often
has a broader meaning in the law, see, e. g., 1 U. S. C. $ 1 ("person" includes
"corporations, companies, associations, firms, partnerships, societies, and
joint stock companies, as well as individuals").

Opinion of the Court
ality of the Act. Subsection (a)(2) requires that copies of
any complaint filed under subsection (a)(1) "shall be promptly
delivered" to both Houses of Congress, and that each House
shall have a right to intervene. Subsection (b) authorizes a
direct appeal to this Court from any order of the District
Court, and requires that the appeal be filed within 10 days.
Subsection (c) imposes a duty on both the District Court and
this Court "to advance on the docket and to expedite to the
greatest possible extent the disposition of any matter
brought under subsection (a)." There is no plausible reason why Congress would have intended to provide for such
special treatment of actions filed by natural persons and to
have precluded entirely jurisdiction over comparable cases
brought by corporate persons. Acceptance of the Government's new-found reading of $ 692 "would produce an absurd
and unjust result which Congress could not have intended."
Griffin v. Oceanic Contractors, Inc., 458 U. S. 564, 574
(1982).14

We are also unpersuaded by the Government's argument
that appellees' challenge to the constitutionality of the Act
is nonjusticiable. We agree, of course, that Article III of the
Constitution confines the jurisdiction of the federal courts to
actual "Cases" and "Controversies," and that "the doctrine
of standing serves to identify those disputes which are
appropriately resolved through the judicial process." Whit14 Justice Scalia objects to our conclusion that the Government's reading of the statute would produce an absurd result. Post, at 454-455.
Nonetheless, he states that " `the case is of such imperative public importance as to justify deviation from normal appellate practice and to require
immediate determination in this Court.' " Post, at 455 (quoting this
Court's Rule 11). Unlike Justice Scalia, however, we need not rely on
our own sense of the importance of the issue involved; instead, the structure of $ 692 makes it clear that Congress believed the issue warranted
expedited review and, therefore, that Congress did not intend the result
that the word "individual" would dictate in other contexts.

more v. Arkansas, 495 U. S. 149, 155 (1990).15 Our disposi-tion of the first challenge to the constitutionality of this Act

demonstrates our recognition of the importance of respect-ing the constitutional limits on our jurisdiction, even when
Congress has manifested an interest in obtaining our viewsas promptly as possible. But these cases differ from

Raines,not only because the President's exercise of his cancellation

authority has removed any concern about the ripeness of thedispute, but more importantly because the parties have alleged a "personal stake" in having an actual injury redressedrather than an "institutional injury" that is "abstract and
widely dispersed." 521 U. S., at 829.In both the New York and the Snake River cases, the Government argues that the appellees are not actually injuredbecause the claims are too speculative and, in any event, the
claims are advanced by the wrong parties. We find no meritin the suggestion that New York's injury is merely speculative because HHS has not yet acted on the State's waiverrequests. The State now has a multibillion dollar contingent liability that had been eliminated by $ 4722(c) of theBalanced Budget Act of 1997. The District Court correctly
concluded that the State, and the appellees, "suffered an im-mediate, concrete injury the moment that the President used
the Line Item Veto to cancel section 4722(c) and deprivedthem of the benefits of that law." 985 F. Supp., at 174. The
self-evident significance of the contingent liability is con-firmed by the fact that New York lobbied Congress for this
relief, that Congress decided that it warranted statutory at-tention, and that the President selected for cancellation only
this one provision in an Act that occupies 536 pages of theStatutes at Large. His action was comparable to the judgment of an appellate court setting aside a verdict for thedefendant and remanding for a new trial of a multibillion

15 To meet the standing requirements of Article III, "[a] plaintiff must
allege personal injury fairly traceable to the defendant's allegedly unlawful conduct and likely to be redressed by the requested relief." Allen v.

Opinion of the Court
dollar damages claim. Even if the outcome of the secondtrial is speculative, the reversal, like the President's cancellation, causes a significant immediate injury by depriving thedefendant of the benefit of a favorable final judgment. The
revival of a substantial contingent liability immediately anddirectly affects the borrowing power, financial strength, and
fiscal planning of the potential obligor.16We also reject the Government's argument that New
York's claim is advanced by the wrong parties because theclaim belongs to the State of New York, and not appellees.
Under New York statutes that are already in place, it is clearthat both the City of New York

17 and the appellee health

care providers 18 will be assessed by the State for substantialportions of any recoupment payments that the State may

have to make to the Federal Government. To the extent ofsuch assessments, they have the same potential liability as
the State does.19

16 Because the cancellation of the legislative equivalent of a favorable
final judgment causes immediate injury, the Government's reliance on
Anderson v. Green, 513 U. S. 557 (1995) (per curiam), is misplaced. That
case involved a challenge to a California statute that would have imposed
limits on welfare payments to new residents during their first year of
residence in California. The statute could not become effective without
a waiver from HHS. Although such a waiver had been in effect when the
action was filed, it had been vacated in a separate proceeding and HHS
had not sought review of that judgment. Accordingly, at the time the
Anderson case reached this Court, the plaintiffs were receiving the same
benefits as long-term residents; they had suffered no injury. We held that
the case was not ripe because, unless and until HHS issued a new waiver,
any future injury was purely conjectural. Id., at 559 ("The parties [i. e.,
the plaintiffs and California, but not HHS] have no live dispute now, and
whether one will arise in the future is conjectural"). Unlike New York in
this case, they were not contingently liable for anything.

19 The Government relies on Warth v. Seldin, 422 U. S. 490 (1975), to

support its argument that the State, and not appellees, should be bringing
this claim. In Warth we held, inter alia, that citizens of Rochester did
not have standing to challenge the exclusionary zoning practices of another community because their claimed injury of increased taxation turned

432 CLINTON v. CITY OF NEW YORK

Opinion of the Court
The Snake River farmers' cooperative also suffered an im-mediate injury when the President canceled the limited tax

benefit that Congress had enacted to facilitate the acquisitionof processing plants. Three critical facts identify the specificity and the importance of that injury. First, Congressenacted $ 968 for the specific purpose of providing a benefit
to a defined category of potential purchasers of a defined cat-egory of assets.

20 The members of that statutorily defined

class received the equivalent of a statutory "bargaining chip"to use in carrying out the congressional plan to facilitate

their purchase of such assets. Second, the President se-lected $ 968 as one of only two tax benefits in the Taxpayer
Relief Act of 1997 that should be canceled. The cancellationrested on his determination that the use of those bargaining
chips would have a significant impact on the federal budgetdeficit. Third, the Snake River cooperative was organized
for the very purpose of acquiring processing facilities, it hadconcrete plans to utilize the benefits of $ 968, and it was engaged in ongoing negotiations with the owner of a processingplant who had expressed an interest in structuring a taxdeferred sale when the President canceled $ 968. Moreover,it is actively searching for other processing facilities for possible future purchase if the President's cancellation is re-versed; and there are ample processing facilities in the State
that Snake River may be able to purchase.21 By deprivingthem of their statutory bargaining chip, the cancellation
inflicted a sufficient likelihood of economic injury to estab-lish standing under our precedents. See,

e. g., Investment

on the prospective actions of Rochester officials. Id., at 509. Appellees'
injury in this case, however, does not turn on the independent actions of
third parties, as existing New York law will automatically require that
appellees reimburse the State.

Because both the City of New York and the health care appellees have
standing, we need not consider whether the appellee unions also have
standing to sue. See, e. g., Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U. S. 714, 721 (1986).

(3d ed. 1994) ("The Court routinely recognizes probableeconomic injury resulting from [governmental actions] that
alter competitive conditions as sufficient to satisfy the [Arti-cle III `injury-in-fact' requirement]. . . . It follows logically
that any . . . petitioner who is likely to suffer economic injuryas a result of [governmental action] that changes market conditions satisfies this part of the standing test").Appellees' injury in this regard is at least as concrete as
the injury suffered by the respondents in Bryant v. Yellen,447 U. S. 352 (1980). In that case, we considered whether a
rule that generally limited water deliveries from reclamationprojects to 160 acres applied to the much larger tracts of
the Imperial Irrigation District in southeastern California;application of that limitation would have given large landowners an incentive to sell excess lands at prices below theprevailing market price for irrigated land. The District
Court had held that the 160-acre limitation did not apply, andfarmers who had hoped to purchase the excess land sought
to appeal. We acknowledged that the farmers had not pre-sented "detailed information about [their] financial resources," and noted that "the prospect of windfall profitscould attract a large number of potential purchasers" besides
the farmers. Id., at 367, n. 17. Nonetheless, "even thoughthey could not with certainty establish that they would be
able to purchase excess lands" if the judgment were re-versed, id., at 367, we found standing because it was "likely
that excess lands would become available at less than marketprices," id., at 368. The Snake River appellees have alleged
an injury that is as specific and immediate as that in Yellen.See also Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Environmental Study
Group, Inc., 438 U. S. 59, 72-78 (1978).22

if Snake River would have actually obtained a facility on favorable terms.

434 CLINTON v. CITY OF NEW YORK

Opinion of the Court
As with the New York case, the Government argues thatthe wrong parties are before the Court--that because the

sellers of the processing facilities would have received thetax benefits, only they have standing to challenge the cancellation of $ 968. This argument not only ignores the fact thatthe cooperatives were the intended beneficiaries of $ 968, but
also overlooks the self-evident proposition that more thanone party may have standing to challenge a particular action
or inaction.23 Once it is determined that a particular plaincan itself create an Article III injury, irrespective of the end result. See
Northeastern Fla. Chapter, Associated Gen. Contractors of America v.
Jacksonville, 508 U. S. 656, 666 (1993). In that case an association of contractors challenged a city ordinance that accorded preferential treatment
to certain minority-owned businesses in the award of city contracts. The
Court of Appeals had held that the association lacked standing "because
it failed to allege that one or more of its members would have been
awarded a contract but for the challenged ordinance." Id., at 664. We
rejected the Court of Appeals' position, stating that it "cannot be reconciled with our precedents." Ibid. Even though the preference applied
to only a small percentage of the city's business, and even though there
was no showing that any party would have received a contract absent the
ordinance, we held that the prospective bidders had standing; the "injury

in fact" was the harm to the contractors in the negotiation process, "not
the ultimate inability to obtain the benefit." Id., at 666.

Having found that both the New York and Snake River appellees are
actually injured, traceability and redressability are easily satisfied--each
injury is traceable to the President's cancellation of $ 4722(c) or $ 968, and
would be redressed by a declaratory judgment that the cancellations are
invalid.

23 Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737 (1984), and Simon v. Eastern Ky. Welfare Rights Organization, 426 U. S. 26 (1976), are distinguishable, as each
of those cases involved a speculative chain of causation quite different
from the situation here. In Allen, parents of black public school children
alleged that, even though it was the policy of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to deny tax-exempt status to racially discriminatory schools,
the IRS had "not adopted sufficient standards and procedures" to enforce
this policy. 468 U. S., at 739. The parents alleged that the lax enforcement caused white students to attend discriminatory private schools and,
therefore, interfered with their children's opportunity to attend desegre524US2 Unit: $U93 [09-11-00 13:25:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
tiff is harmed by the defendant, and that the harm will likelybe redressed by a favorable decision, that plaintiff has

standing--regardless of whether there are others who would
gated public schools. We held that the chain of causation between the
challenged action and the alleged injury was too attenuated to confer
standing:

"It is, first, uncertain how many racially discriminatory private schools
are in fact receiving tax exemptions. Moreover, it is entirely speculative
. . . whether withdrawal of a tax exemption from any particular school
would lead the school to change its policies. . . . It is just as speculative
whether any given parent of a child attending such a private school would
decide to transfer the child to public school as a result of any changes
in educational or financial policy made by the private school once it was
threatened with loss of tax-exempt status. It is also pure speculation
whether, in a particular community, a large enough number of the numerous relevant school officials and parents would reach decisions that collectively would have a significant impact on the racial composition of the
public schools." Id., at 758 (footnote omitted).

Similarly, in Simon, the respondents challenged an IRS Revenue Ruling that granted favorable tax treatment to nonprofit hospitals that offered only emergency-room services to the poor. The respondents argued
that the Revenue Ruling " `encouraged' hospitals to deny services to indigents." 426 U. S., at 42. As in Allen, we held that the chain of causation
was too attenuated:

"It is purely speculative whether the denials of service . . . fairly can be
traced to [the IRS's] `encouragement' or instead result from decisions made
by the hospitals without regard to the tax implications.

"It is equally speculative whether the desired exercise of the court's
remedial powers in this suit would result in the availability to respondents
of such services. So far as the complaint sheds light, it is just as plausible that the hospitals to which respondents may apply for service would
elect to forgo favorable tax treatment to avoid the undetermined financial
drain of an increase in the level of uncompensated services." 426 U. S.,
at 42-43.

See also id., at 45 ("Speculative inferences are necessary to connect
[respondents'] injury to the challenged actions of petitioners").

The injury in the present case is comparable to the repeal of a law
granting a subsidy to sellers of processing plants if, and only if, they sell
to farmers' cooperatives. Every farmers' cooperative seeking to buy a
processing plant is harmed by that repeal.

also have standing to sue. Thus, we are satisfied that bothof these actions are Article III "Cases" that we have a duty

to decide. IV

The Line Item Veto Act gives the President the powerto "cancel in whole" three types of provisions that have
been signed into law: "(1) any dollar amount of discretionarybudget authority; (2) any item of new direct spending; or
(3) any limited tax benefit." 2 U. S. C. $ 691(a) (1994 ed.,Supp. II). It is undisputed that the New York case involves
an "item of new direct spending" and that the Snake Rivercase involves a "limited tax benefit" as those terms are defined in the Act. It is also undisputed that each of thoseprovisions had been signed into law pursuant to Article I,

$ 7, of the Constitution before it was canceled.The Act requires the President to adhere to precise procedures whenever he exercises his cancellation authority. Inidentifying items for cancellation he must consider the legislative history, the purposes, and other relevant informationabout the items. See 2 U. S. C. $ 691(b) (1994 ed., Supp. II).
He must determine, with respect to each cancellation, that itwill "(i) reduce the Federal budget deficit; (ii) not impair any
essential Government functions; and (iii) not harm the na-tional interest." $ 691(a)(A). Moreover, he must transmit a
special message to Congress notifying it of each cancellationwithin five calendar days (excluding Sundays) after the
enactment of the canceled provision. See $ 691(a)(B). It isundisputed that the President meticulously followed these
procedures in these cases.A cancellation takes effect upon receipt by Congress of
the special message from the President. See $ 691b(a). If,however, a "disapproval bill" pertaining to a special message
is enacted into law, the cancellations set forth in that mes-sage become "null and void." Ibid. The Act sets forth a
detailed expedited procedure for the consideration of a "dis-approval bill," see $ 691d, but no such bill was passed for

Opinion of the Court
either of the cancellations involved in these cases.24 A ma-jority vote of both Houses is sufficient to enact a disapproval

bill. The Act does not grant the President the authority tocancel a disapproval bill, see $ 691(c), but he does, of course,
retain his constitutional authority to veto such a bill.25The effect of a cancellation is plainly stated in $ 691e,
which defines the principal terms used in the Act. With re-spect to both an item of new direct spending and a limited
tax benefit, the cancellation prevents the item "from havinglegal force or effect." $$ 691e(4)(B)-(C).

26 Thus, under the

24 Congress failed to act upon proposed legislation to disapprove these
cancellations. See S. 1157, H. R. 2444, S. 1144, and H. R. 2436, 105th
Cong., 1st Sess. (1997). Indeed, despite the fact that the President has
canceled at least 82 items since the Act was passed, see Statement of June
E. O'Neill, Director, Congressional Budget Office, Line Item Veto Act
After One Year, The Process and Its Implementation, before the Subcommittee on Legislative and Budget Process of the House Committee on
Rules, 105th Cong., 2d Sess. (Mar. 11-12, 1998), Congress has enacted only
one law, over a Presidential veto, disapproving any cancellation, see Pub.
L. 105-159, 112 Stat. 19 (1998) (disapproving the cancellation of 38 military
construction spending items).

25 See n. 29, infra.

26 The term "cancel," used in connection with any dollar amount of discretionary budget authority, means "to rescind." 2 U. S. C. $ 691e(4)(A).
The entire definition reads as follows:

"The term `cancel' or `cancellation' means--
"(A) with respect to any dollar amount of discretionary budget authority, to rescind;

"(B) with respect to any item of new direct spending--
"(i) that is budget authority provided by law (other than an appropriation law), to prevent such budget authority from having legal force or
effect;

"(ii) that is entitlement authority, to prevent the specific legal obligation
of the United States from having legal force or effect; or

"(iii) through the food stamp program, to prevent the specific provision
of law that results in an increase in budget authority or outlays for that
program from having legal force or effect; and

"(C) with respect to a limited tax benefit, to prevent the specific provision of law that provides such benefit from having legal force or effect."

plain text of the statute, the two actions of the Presidentthat are challenged in these cases prevented one section of

the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and one section of the Tax-payer Relief Act of 1997 "from having legal force or effect."
The remaining provisions of those statutes, with the ex-ception of the second canceled item in the latter, continue
to have the same force and effect as they had when signedinto law.

In both legal and practical effect, the President hasamended two Acts of Congress by repealing a portion of
each. "[R]epeal of statutes, no less than enactment, mustconform with Art. I."

INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S. 919, 954(1983). There is no provision in the Constitution that authorizes the President to enact, to amend, or to repeal stat-utes. Both Article I and Article II assign responsibilities to
the President that directly relate to the lawmaking process,but neither addresses the issue presented by these cases.
The President "shall from time to time give to the CongressInformation on the State of the Union, and recommend to
their Consideration such Measures as he shall judge neces-sary and expedient . . . ." Art. II, $ 3. Thus, he may initiate
and influence legislative proposals.27 Moreover, after a billhas passed both Houses of Congress, but "before it become[s]
a Law," it must be presented to the President. If he ap-proves it, "he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it, with
his Objections to that House in which it shall have origi-nated, who shall enter the Objections at large on their Journal, and proceed to reconsider it." Art. I, $ 7, cl. 2.28 His

$ 1555, p. 413 (1833) (Art. II, $ 3, enables the President "to point out the
evil, and to suggest the remedy").

28 The full text of the relevant paragraph of $ 7 provides:

"Every Bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and
the Senate, shall, before it become a Law, be presented to the President
of the United States: If he approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall
return it, with his Objections to that House in which it shall have originated, who shall enter the Objections at large on their Journal, and pro524US2 Unit: $U93 [09-11-00 13:25:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
"return" of a bill, which is usually described as a "veto," 29 is
subject to being overridden by a two-thirds vote in each
House.

There are important differences between the President's
"return" of a bill pursuant to Article I, $ 7, and the exercise
of the President's cancellation authority pursuant to the Line
Item Veto Act. The constitutional return takes place before
the bill becomes law; the statutory cancellation occurs after
the bill becomes law. The constitutional return is of the entire bill; the statutory cancellation is of only a part. Although the Constitution expressly authorizes the President
to play a role in the process of enacting statutes, it is silent
on the subject of unilateral Presidential action that either
repeals or amends parts of duly enacted statutes.

There are powerful reasons for construing constitutional
silence on this profoundly important issue as equivalent to
an express prohibition. The procedures governing the enactment of statutes set forth in the text of Article I were
the product of the great debates and compromises that
produced the Constitution itself. Familiar historical materials provide abundant support for the conclusion that the
power to enact statutes may only "be exercised in accord
with a single, finely wrought and exhaustively considered,

ceed to reconsider it. If after such Reconsideration two thirds of that
House shall agree to pass the Bill, it shall be sent, together with the Objections, to the other House, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered, and
if approved by two thirds of that House, it shall become a Law. But in
all such Cases the Votes of both Houses shall be determined by Yeas and
Nays, and the Names of the Persons voting for and against the Bill shall
be entered on the Journal of each House respectively. If any Bill shall
not be returned by the President within ten Days (Sundays excepted)
after it shall have been presented to him, the Same shall be a Law, in like
Manner as if he had signed it, unless the Congress by their Adjournment
prevent its Return, in which Case it shall not be a Law."

29 "In constitutional terms, `veto' is used to describe the President's

power under Art. I, $ 7, of the Constitution." INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S.
919, 925, n. 2 (1983) (citing Black's Law Dictionary 1403 (5th ed. 1979)).

procedure." Chadha, 462 U. S., at 951. Our first Presidentunderstood the text of the Presentment Clause as requiring

that he either "approve all the parts of a Bill, or reject it intoto."

30 What has emerged in these cases from the President's exercise of his statutory cancellation powers, however,are truncated versions of two bills that passed both Houses

of Congress. They are not the product of the "finelywrought" procedure that the Framers designed.

At oral argument, the Government suggested that the can-cellations at issue in these cases do not effect a "repeal" of
the canceled items because under the special "lockbox" pro-visions of the Act,

31 a canceled item "retain[s] real, legal

also W. Taft, The Presidency: Its Duties, Its Powers, Its Opportunities
and Its Limitations 11 (1916) (stating that the President "has no power to
veto part of a bill and let the rest become a law"); cf. 1 W. Blackstone,
Commentaries *154 ("The crown cannot begin of itself any alterations in
the present established law; but it may approve or disapprove of the alterations suggested and consented to by the two houses").

31 The lockbox procedure ensures that savings resulting from cancellations are used to reduce the deficit, rather than to offset deficit increases
arising from other laws. See 2 U. S. C. $$ 691c(a)-(b) (1994 ed., Supp. II);
see also H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 104-491, pp. 23-24 (1996). The Office of
Management and Budget (OMB) estimates the deficit reduction resulting
from each cancellation of new direct spending or limited tax benefit items
and presents its estimate as a separate entry in the "pay-as-you-go" report
submitted to Congress pursuant to $ 252(d) of the Balanced Budget and
Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (or Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act),
2 U. S. C. $ 902(d). See $ 691c(a)(2)(A) (1994 ed., Supp. II); see also H. R.
Conf. Rep. No. 104-491, at 23. The "pay-as-you-go" requirement acts as
a self-imposed limitation on Congress' ability to increase spending and/or
reduce revenue: If spending increases are not offset by revenue increases
(or if revenue reductions are not offset by spending reductions), then a
"sequester" of the excess budgeted funds is required. See 2 U. S. C.

$$ 900(b), 901(a)(1), 902(b), 906(l). OMB does not include the estimated
savings resulting from a cancellation in the report it must submit under

$$ 252(b) and 254 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control
Act of 1985, 2 U. S. C. $$ 902(b), 904. See $ 691c(a)(2)(B). By providing
in this way that such savings "shall not be included in the pay-as-you-go
balances," Congress ensures that "savings from the cancellation of new

Opinion of the Court
budgetary effect" insofar as it prevents Congress and the
President from spending the savings that result from the
cancellation. Tr. of Oral Arg. 10.32 The text of the Act
expressly provides, however, that a cancellation prevents a
direct spending or tax benefit provision "from having legal
force or effect." 2 U. S. C. $$ 691e(4)(B)-(C). That a canceled item may have "real, legal budgetary effect" as a result
of the lockbox procedure does not change the fact that by
canceling the items at issue in these cases, the President
made them entirely inoperative as to appellees. Section 968
of the Taxpayer Relief Act no longer provides a tax benefit,
and $ 4722(c) of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 no longer
relieves New York of its contingent liability.33 Such significant changes do not lose their character simply because the
canceled provisions may have some continuing financial effect on the Government.34 The cancellation of one section
of a statute may be the functional equivalent of a partial
repeal even if a portion of the section is not canceled.

direct spending or limited tax benefits are devoted to deficit reduction and
are not available to offset a deficit increase in another law." H. R. Conf.
Rep. No. 104-491, at 23. Thus, the "pay-as-you-go" cap does not change
upon cancellation because the canceled item is not treated as canceled.
Moreover, if Congress enacts a disapproval bill, "OMB will not score this
legislation as increasing the deficit under pay as you go." Ibid.

32 The Snake River appellees have argued that the lockbox provisions

have no such effect with respect to the canceled tax benefits at issue.
Because we reject the Government's suggestion that the lockbox provisions alter our constitutional analysis, however, we find it unnecessary
to resolve the dispute over the details of the lockbox procedure's
applicability.

33 Thus, although "Congress's use of infelicitous terminology cannot

transform the cancellation into an unconstitutional amendment or repeal
of an enacted law," Brief for Appellants 40-41 (citations omitted), the
actual effect of a cancellation is entirely consistent with the language of
the Act.

34 Moreover, Congress always retains the option of statutorily amending

or repealing the lockbox provisions and/or the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings
Act, so as to eliminate any lingering financial effect of canceled items.

442 CLINTON v. CITY OF NEW YORK

Opinion of the Court

V
The Government advances two related arguments to support its position that despite the unambiguous provisions of
the Act, cancellations do not amend or repeal properly
enacted statutes in violation of the Presentment Clause.
First, relying primarily on Field v. Clark, 143 U. S. 649
(1892), the Government contends that the cancellations were
merely exercises of discretionary authority granted to the
President by the Balanced Budget Act and the Taxpayer Relief Act read in light of the previously enacted Line Item
Veto Act. Second, the Government submits that the substance of the authority to cancel tax and spending items "is,
in practical effect, no more and no less than the power to
`decline to spend' specified sums of money, or to `decline to
implement' specified tax measures." Brief for Appellants
40. Neither argument is persuasive.

In Field v. Clark, the Court upheld the constitutionality
of the Tariff Act of 1890. Act of Oct. 1, 1890, 26 Stat. 567.
That statute contained a "free list" of almost 300 specific articles that were exempted from import duties "unless otherwise specially provided for in this act." Id., at 602. Section 3 was a special provision that directed the President to
suspend that exemption for sugar, molasses, coffee, tea, and
hides "whenever, and so often" as he should be satisfied that
any country producing and exporting those products imposed duties on the agricultural products of the United
States that he deemed to be "reciprocally unequal and
unreasonable. . . ." Id., at 612, quoted in Field, 143 U. S.,
at 680. The section then specified the duties to be imposed
on those products during any such suspension. The Court
provided this explanation for its conclusion that $ 3 had not
delegated legislative power to the President:

"Nothing involving the expediency or the just operation
of such legislation was left to the determination of the
President. . . . [W]hen he ascertained the fact that duties

524US2 Unit: $U93 [09-11-00 13:25:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN

443Cite as: 524 U. S. 417 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
and exactions, reciprocally unequal and unreasonable,were imposed upon the agricultural or other products of

the United States by a country producing and exportingsugar, molasses, coffee, tea or hides, it became his duty
to issue a proclamation declaring the suspension, as tothat country, which Congress had determined should
occur. He had no discretion in the premises except inrespect to the duration of the suspension so ordered.
But that related only to the enforcement of the policyestablished by Congress. As the suspension was absolutely required when the President ascertained the ex-istence of a particular fact, it cannot be said that in ascertaining that fact and in issuing his proclamation, inobedience to the legislative will, he exercised the function of making laws. . . . It was a part of the law itselfas it left the hands of Congress that the provisions, full
and complete in themselves, permitting the free intro-duction of sugars, molasses, coffee, tea and hides, from
particular countries, should be suspended, in a givencontingency, and that in case of such suspensions certain
duties should be imposed." Id., at 693.
This passage identifies three critical differences betweenthe power to suspend the exemption from import duties and

the power to cancel portions of a duly enacted statute.First, the exercise of the suspension power was contingent
upon a condition that did not exist when the Tariff Act waspassed: the imposition of "reciprocally unequal and unreasonable" import duties by other countries. In contrast, the ex-ercise of the cancellation power within five days after the
enactment of the Balanced Budget and Tax Reform Acts nec-essarily was based on the same conditions that Congress
evaluated when it passed those statutes. Second, under theTariff Act, when the President determined that the contingency had arisen, he had a duty to suspend; in contrast, whileit is true that the President was required by the Act to make
three determinations before he canceled a provision, see 2

U. S. C. $ 691(a)(A) (1994 ed., Supp. II), those determinationsdid not qualify his discretion to cancel or not to cancel. Finally, whenever the President suspended an exemptionunder the Tariff Act, he was executing the policy that Congress had embodied in the statute. In contrast, wheneverthe President cancels an item of new direct spending or a
limited tax benefit he is rejecting the policy judgment madeby Congress and relying on his own policy judgment.

35

Thus, the conclusion in Field v. Clark that the suspensionsmandated by the Tariff Act were not exercises of legislative

power does not undermine our opinion that cancellationspursuant to the Line Item Veto Act are the functional equivalent of partial repeals of Acts of Congress that fail to satisfyArticle I, $ 7.

The Government's reliance upon other tariff and importstatutes, discussed in Field, that contain provisions similar
to the one challenged in Field is unavailing for the samereasons.

36 Some of those statutes authorized the President

to "suspen[d] and discontinu[e]" statutory duties upon his de-termination that discriminatory duties imposed by other nations had been abolished. See 143 U. S., at 686-687 (discuss-ing Act of Jan. 7, 1824, ch. 4, $ 4, 4 Stat. 3, and Act of May
24, 1828, ch. 111, 4 Stat. 308).37 A slightly different statute,

35 For example, one reason that the President gave for canceling $ 968 of
the Taxpayer Relief Act was his conclusion that "this provision failed to
target its benefits to small-and-medium size cooperatives." App. to Juris.
Statement 71a (Cancellation No. 97-2); see n. 8, supra. Because the Line
Item Veto Act requires the President to act within five days, every exercise of the cancellation power will necessarily be based on the same facts
and circumstances that Congress considered, and therefore constitute a
rejection of the policy choice made by Congress.

36 The Court did not, of course, expressly consider in Field whether

those statutes comported with the requirements of the Presentment
Clause.

37 Cf. 143 U. S., at 688 (discussing Act of Mar. 6, 1866, ch. 12, $ 2, 14 Stat.

4, which permitted the President to "declare the provisions of this act to
be inoperative" and lift import restrictions on foreign cattle and hides
upon a showing that such importation would not endanger U. S. cattle).

Act of May 31, 1830, ch. 219, $ 2, 4 Stat. 425, provided thatcertain statutory provisions imposing duties on foreign ships

"shall be repealed" upon the same no-discrimination determi-nation by the President. See 143 U. S., at 687; see also id.,
at 686 (discussing similar tariff statute, Act of Mar. 3, 1815,ch. 77, 3 Stat. 224, which provided that duties "are hereby
repealed," "[s]uch repeal to take effect . . . whenever thePresident" makes the required determination).

The cited statutes all relate to foreign trade, and thisCourt has recognized that in the foreign affairs arena, the
President has "a degree of discretion and freedom from stat-utory restriction which would not be admissible were domestic affairs alone involved." United States v. Curtiss-WrightExport Corp., 299 U. S. 304, 320 (1936). "Moreover, he, not
Congress, has the better opportunity of knowing the condi-tions which prevail in foreign countries."

Ibid.38 More im-portant, when enacting the statutes discussed in

Field, Congress itself made the decision to suspend or repeal the
particular provisions at issue upon the occurrence of particu-lar events subsequent to enactment, and it left only the determination of whether such events occurred up to the Presi-dent.

39 The Line Item Veto Act authorizes the President

himself to effect the repeal of laws, for his own policy rea-sons, without observing the procedures set out in Article I,

$ 7. The fact that Congress intended such a result is of no

38 Indeed, the Court in Field v. Clark, 143 U. S. 649 (1892), so limited its
reasoning: "[I]n the judgment of the legislative branch of the government,
it is often desirable, if not essential for the protection of the interests of
our people, against the unfriendly or discriminating regulations established by foreign governments, . . . to invest the President with large
discretion in matters arising out of the execution of statutes relating to
trade and commerce with other nations." Id., at 691.

(1928) ("Congress may feel itself unable conveniently to determine exactly
when its exercise of the legislative power should become effective, because
dependent on future conditions, and it may leave the determination of such
time to the decision of an Executive").

Opinion of the Court
moment. Although Congress presumably anticipated thatthe President might cancel some of the items in the Balanced

Budget Act and in the Taxpayer Relief Act, Congress cannotalter the procedures set out in Article I, $ 7, without amending the Constitution.40Neither are we persuaded by the Government's contention
that the President's authority to cancel new direct spendingand tax benefit items is no greater than his traditional authority to decline to spend appropriated funds. The Gov-ernment has reviewed in some detail the series of statutes
in which Congress has given the Executive broad discretionover the expenditure of appropriated funds. For example,
the First Congress appropriated "sum[s] not exceeding"specified amounts to be spent on various Government operations. See, e. g., Act of Sept. 29, 1789, ch. 23, 1 Stat. 95; Actof Mar. 26, 1790, ch. 4, $ 1, 1 Stat. 104; Act of Feb. 11, 1791,
ch. 6, 1 Stat. 190. In those statutes, as in later years, thePresident was given wide discretion with respect to both the
amounts to be spent and how the money would be allocatedamong different functions. It is argued that the Line Item
Veto Act merely confers comparable discretionary authorityover the expenditure of appropriated funds. The critical

40 The Government argues that the Rules Enabling Act, 28 U. S. C.

$ 2072(b), permits this Court to "repeal" prior laws without violating
Article I, $ 7. Section 2072(b) provides that this Court may promulgate
rules of procedure for the lower federal courts and that "[a]ll laws in conflict with such rules shall be of no further force or effect after such rules
have taken effect." See Sibbach v. Wilson & Co., 312 U. S. 1, 10 (1941)
(stating that the procedural rules that this Court promulgates, "if they
are within the authority granted by Congress, repeal" a prior inconsistent
procedural statute); see also Henderson v. United States, 517 U. S. 654,
664 (1996) (citing $ 2072(b)). In enacting $ 2072(b), however, Congress expressly provided that laws inconsistent with the procedural rules promulgated by this Court would automatically be repealed upon the enactment
of new rules in order to create a uniform system of rules for Article III
courts. As in the tariff statutes, Congress itself made the decision to
repeal prior rules upon the occurrence of a particular event--here, the
promulgation of procedural rules by this Court.

Opinion of the Court
difference between this statute and all of its predecessors,however, is that unlike any of them, this Act gives the President the unilateral power to change the text of duly enactedstatutes. None of the Act's predecessors could even arguably have been construed to authorize such a change.

VI
Although they are implicit in what we have already writ-ten, the profound importance of these cases makes it appropriate to emphasize three points.First, we express no opinion about the wisdom of the procedures authorized by the Line Item Veto Act. Many mem-bers of both major political parties who have served in the
Legislative and the Executive Branches have long advocatedthe enactment of such procedures for the purpose of "ensur[ing] greater fiscal accountability in Washington." H. R.Conf. Rep. 104-491, p. 15 (1996).

41 The text of the Act was

itself the product of much debate and deliberation in bothHouses of Congress and that precise text was signed into

law by the President. We do not lightly conclude that theiraction was unauthorized by the Constitution.

42 We have,

however, twice had full argument and briefing on the ques-tion and have concluded that our duty is clear.

Second, although appellees challenge the validity of theAct on alternative grounds, the only issue we address concerns the "finely wrought" procedure commanded by theConstitution.

national problem, it should only do so for the most compelling constitutional reasons").

favored with extensive debate about the scope of Congress'power to delegate lawmaking authority, or its functional

equivalent, to the President. The excellent briefs filed bythe parties and their amici curiae have provided us with
valuable historical information that illuminates the delega-tion issue but does not really bear on the narrow issue that
is dispositive of these cases. Thus, because we conclude thatthe Act's cancellation provisions violate Article I, $ 7, of the
Constitution, we find it unnecessary to consider the DistrictCourt's alternative holding that the Act "impermissibly disrupts the balance of powers among the three branches of
government." 985 F. Supp., at 179.43Third, our decision rests on the narrow ground that the

procedures authorized by the Line Item Veto Act are notauthorized by the Constitution. The Balanced Budget Act
of 1997 is a 500-page document that became "Public Law105-33" after three procedural steps were taken: (1) a bill
containing its exact text was approved by a majority of the
Members of the House of Representatives; (2) the Senateapproved precisely the same text; and (3) that text was

signed into law by the President. The Constitution explic-itly requires that each of those three steps be taken before
a bill may "become a law." Art. I, $ 7. If one paragraph ofthat text had been omitted at any one of those three stages,
Public Law 105-33 would not have been validly enacted. If
the Line Item Veto Act were valid, it would authorize thePresident to create a different law--one whose text was not

voted on by either House of Congress or presented to thePresident for signature. Something that might be known as
"Public Law 105-33 as modified by the President" may or

43 We also find it unnecessary to consider whether the provisions of the
Act relating to discretionary budget authority are severable from the Act's
tax benefit and direct spending provisions. We note, however, that the
Act contains no severability clause; a severability provision that had appeared in the Senate bill was dropped in conference without explanation.

may not be desirable, but it is surely not a document thatmay "become a law" pursuant to the procedures designed by

the Framers of Article I, $ 7, of the Constitution.If there is to be a new procedure in which the President
will play a different role in determining the final text of whatmay "become a law," such change must come not by legislation but through the amendment procedures set forth inArticle V of the Constitution. Cf.

U. S. Term Limits, Inc. v.Thornton, 514 U. S. 779, 837 (1995).

The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.

It is so ordered.
Justice Kennedy, concurring.
A Nation cannot plunder its own treasury without puttingits Constitution and its survival in peril. The statute before

us, then, is of first importance, for it seems undeniable theAct will tend to restrain persistent excessive spending.
Nevertheless, for the reasons given by Justice Stevens inthe opinion for the Court, the statute must be found invalid.
Failure of political will does not justify unconstitutionalremedies.

I write to respond to my colleague Justice Breyer, whoobserves that the statute does not threaten the liberties of
individual citizens, a point on which I disagree. See post, at496-497. The argument is related to his earlier suggestion
that our role is lessened here because the two politicalbranches are adjusting their own powers between themselves. Post, at 472, 482-483. To say the political brancheshave a somewhat free hand to reallocate their own authority
would seem to require acceptance of two premises: first, thatthe public good demands it, and second, that liberty is not at
risk. The former premise is inadmissible. The Constitu-tion's structure requires a stability which transcends the
convenience of the moment. See Metropolitan Washington
Airports Authority v. Citizens for Abatement of AircraftNoise, Inc., 501 U. S. 252, 276-277 (1991); Bowsher v. Synar,

Northern Pipeline Constr. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U. S. 50, 73-74 (1982). The latterpremise, too, is flawed. Liberty is always at stake when one

or more of the branches seek to transgress the separation
of powers.Separation of powers was designed to implement a fundamental insight: Concentration of power in the hands of a sin-gle branch is a threat to liberty. The Federalist states the
axiom in these explicit terms: "The accumulation of all pow-ers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands
. . . may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny."The Federalist No. 47, p. 301 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961). So convinced were the Framers that liberty of the person inheres
in structure that at first they did not consider a Bill of Rightsnecessary. The Federalist No. 84, pp. 513, 515; G. Wood, The

Creation of the American Republic 1776-1787, pp. 536-543(1969). It was at Madison's insistence that the First Congress enacted the Bill of Rights. R. Goldwin, From Parch-ment to Power 75-153 (1997). It would be a grave mistake,
however, to think a Bill of Rights in Madison's scheme thenor in sound constitutional theory now renders separation of
powers of lesser importance. See Amar, The Bill of Rights
as a Constitution, 100 Yale L. J. 1131, 1132 (1991).

In recent years, perhaps, we have come to think of liberty
as defined by that word in the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments and as illuminated by the other provisions of the Bill
of Rights. The conception of liberty embraced by the Framers was not so confined. They used the principles of separation of powers and federalism to secure liberty in the fundamental political sense of the term, quite in addition to the
idea of freedom from intrusive governmental acts. The idea
and the promise were that when the people delegate some
degree of control to a remote central authority, one branch
of government ought not possess the power to shape their
destiny without a sufficient check from the other two. In
this vision, liberty demands limits on the ability of any one

branch to influence basic political decisions. Quoting Montesquieu, the Federalist Papers made the point in the following manner:

" `When the legislative and executive powers are united
in the same person or body,' says he, `there can be no
liberty, because apprehensions may arise lest the same
monarch or senate should enact tyrannical laws to execute them in a tyrannical manner.' Again: `Were the
power of judging joined with the legislative, the life and
liberty of the subject would be exposed to arbitrary control, for the judge would then be the legislator. Were
it joined to the executive power, the judge might behave
with all the violence of an oppressor.' " The Federalist
No. 47, supra, at 303.

It follows that if a citizen who is taxed has the measure of
the tax or the decision to spend determined by the Executive
alone, without adequate control by the citizen's Representatives in Congress, liberty is threatened. Money is the instrument of policy and policy affects the lives of citizens.
The individual loses liberty in a real sense if that instrument
is not subject to traditional constitutional constraints.

The principal object of the statute, it is true, was not to
enhance the President's power to reward one group and punish another, to help one set of taxpayers and hurt another,
to favor one State and ignore another. Yet these are its
undeniable effects. The law establishes a new mechanism
which gives the President the sole ability to hurt a group
that is a visible target, in order to disfavor the group or to
extract further concessions from Congress. The law is the
functional equivalent of a line item veto and enhances the
President's powers beyond what the Framers would have
endorsed.

It is no answer, of course, to say that Congress surrendered its authority by its own hand; nor does it suffice to
point out that a new statute, signed by the President or

enacted over his veto, could restore to Congress the powerit now seeks to relinquish. That a congressional cession of

power is voluntary does not make it innocuous. The Consti-tution is a compact enduring for more than our time, and one
Congress cannot yield up its own powers, much less those of
other Congresses to follow. See Freytag v. Commissioner,501 U. S. 868, 880 (1991); cf.

Chadha, supra, at 942, n. 13.
Abdication of responsibility is not part of the constitutionaldesign.

Separation of powers helps to ensure the ability of eachbranch to be vigorous in asserting its proper authority. In
this respect the device operates on a horizontal axis to secure a proper balance of legislative, executive, and judicial
authority. Separation of powers operates on a vertical axis
as well, between each branch and the citizens in whose interest powers must be exercised. The citizen has a vital interest in the regularity of the exercise of governmental power.
If this point was not clear before Chadha, it should have
been so afterwards. Though Chadha involved the deportation of a person, while the case before us involves the expenditure of money or the grant of a tax exemption, this
circumstance does not mean that the vertical operation of
the separation of powers is irrelevant here. By increasing
the power of the President beyond what the Framers envisioned, the statute compromises the political liberty of our
citizens, liberty which the separation of powers seeks to
secure.

The Constitution is not bereft of controls over improvident
spending. Federalism is one safeguard, for political accountability is easier to enforce within the States than nationwide. The other principal mechanism, of course, is control of the political branches by an informed and responsible
electorate. Whether or not federalism and control by the
electorate are adequate for the problem at hand, they are
two of the structures the Framers designed for the problem
the statute strives to confront. The Framers of the Consti524US2 Unit: $U93 [09-11-00 13:25:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN

tution could not command statesmanship. They could sim-ply provide structures from which it might emerge. The

fact that these mechanisms, plus the proper functioning ofthe separation of powers itself, are not employed, or that
they prove insufficient, cannot validate an otherwise uncon-stitutional device. With these observations, I join the opinion of the Court.

Justice Scalia, with whom Justice O'Connor joins, andwith whom

Justice Breyer joins as to Part III, concurringin part and dissenting in part.

Today the Court acknowledges the " `overriding and time-honored concern about keeping the Judiciary's power within
its proper constitutional sphere.' " Ante, at 421, quoting
Raines v. Byrd, 521 U. S. 811, 820 (1997). It proceeds, how-ever, to ignore the prescribed statutory limits of our jurisdiction by permitting the expedited-review provisions of theLine Item Veto Act to be invoked by persons who are not
"individual[s]," 2 U. S. C. $ 692 (1994 ed., Supp. II); and toignore the constitutional limits of our jurisdiction by permitting one party to challenge the Government's denial to another party of favorable tax treatment from which the firstparty might, but just as likely might not, gain a concrete

benefit. In my view, the Snake River appellees lack stand-ing to challenge the President's cancellation of the "limited
tax benefit," and the constitutionality of that action shouldnot be addressed. I think the New York appellees have
standing to challenge the President's cancellation of an "itemof new direct spending"; I believe we have statutory authority (other than the expedited-review provision) to addressthat challenge; but unlike the Court I find the President's
cancellation of spending items to be entirely in accord withthe Constitution.

I
The Court's unrestrained zeal to reach the merits of thiscase is evident in its disregard of the statute's expedited524US2 Unit: $U93 [09-11-00 13:25:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN

review provision, which extends that special procedure to"[a]ny Member of Congress or any individual adversely

affected by [the Act]." $ 692. With the exception of MikeCranney, a natural person, the appellees--corporations, cooperatives, and governmental entities--are not "individuals"
under any accepted usage of that term. Worse still, the firstprovision of the United States Code confirms that insofar as

this word is concerned, Congress speaks English like the restof us: "In determining the meaning of any Act of Congress,
unless the context indicates otherwise . . . the wor[d] `person'. . . include[s] corporations, companies, associations, firms,
partnerships, societies, and joint stock companies, as well as
individuals." 1 U. S. C. $ 1 (emphasis added). And doubly
worse, one of the definitional provisions of this very Act
expressly distinguishes "individuals" from "persons." Atax law does not create a "limited tax benefit," it says, so

long as

"any difference in the treatment of persons is based
solely on--"(I) in the case of

businesses and associations, the
size or form of the business or association involved;"(II) in the case of

individuals, general demographic
conditions, such as income, marital status, number of de-pendents, or tax return filing status . . . ." 2 U. S. C.

$ 691e(9)(B)(iii) (1994 ed., Supp. II) (emphasis added).
The Court majestically sweeps the plain language of the
statute aside, declaring that "[t]here is no plausible reasonwhy Congress would have intended to provide for such

special treatment of actions filed by natural persons and to
have precluded entirely jurisdiction over comparable cases
brought by corporate persons." Ante, at 429. Indeed, the
Court says, it would be "absurd" for Congress to have done
so. Ibid. But Congress treats individuals more favorably
than corporations and other associations all the time. There
is nothing whatever extraordinary--and surely nothing so

bizarre as to permit this Court to declare a "scrivener'serror"--in believing that individuals will suffer more seriously from delay in the receipt of "vetoed" benefits or taxsavings than corporations will, and therefore according individuals (but not corporations) expedited review. It may be
unlikely that this is what Congress actually had in mind; butit is what Congress said, it is not so absurd as to be an obvious mistake, and it is therefore the law.The only individual who has sued, and thus the only appellee who qualifies for expedited review under $ 692, is MikeCranney. Since $ 692 does not confer jurisdiction over the
claims of the other appellees, we must dismiss them, unless
we have jurisdiction under another statute. In their complaints, appellees sought declaratory relief not only under

$ 692(a), but also under the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28
U. S. C. $ 2201, invoking the District Court's jurisdiction
under 28 U. S. C. $ 1331. After the District Court ruled, the
Government appealed directly to this Court, but it also filed
a notice of appeal to the Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit. In light of the Government's representation that it desires "[t]o eliminate any possibility that the
district court's decision might escape review," Reply Brief
for Appellants 2, n. 1, I would deem its appeal to this Court a
petition for writ of certiorari before judgment, see 28 U. S. C.

$ 2101(e), and grant it. Under this Court's Rule 11, "[a] petition for a writ of certiorari to review a case pending in a
United States court of appeals, before judgment is entered
in that court, will be granted only upon a showing that the
case is of such imperative public importance as to justify
deviation from normal appellate practice and to require immediate determination in this Court." In light of the public
importance of the issues involved, and the little sense it
would make for the Government to pursue its appeal against
one appellee in this Court and against the others in the
Court of Appeals, the entire case, in my view, qualifies for
certiorari review before judgment.

Opinion of Scalia, J.

II
Not only must we be satisfied that we have statutory juris-diction to hear this case; we must be satisfied that we have

jurisdiction under Article III. "To meet the standing re-quirements of Article III, `[a] plaintiff must allege

personalinjury fairly traceable to the defendant's allegedly unlawful

conduct and likely to be redressed by the requested relief.' "Raines, 521 U. S., at 818, quoting Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S.
737, 751 (1984).In the first action before us, appellees Snake River Potato
Growers, Inc. (Snake River) and Mike Cranney, Snake Riv-er's Director and Vice-Chairman, challenge the constitutionality of the President's cancellation of $ 968 of the TaxpayerRelief Act of 1997. The Snake River appellees have standing, in the Court's view, because $ 968 gave them "the equiv-alent of a statutory `bargaining chip,' " and "[b]y depriving
them of their statutory bargaining chip, the cancellationinflicted a sufficient likelihood of economic injury to establish standing under our precedents." Ante, at 432. It isunclear whether the Court means that deprivation of a
"bargaining chip" itself suffices for standing, or that suchdeprivation suffices in the present case because it creates
a likelihood of economic injury. The former is wrong as amatter of law, and the latter is wrong as a matter of fact,
on the facts alleged.For the proposition that "a denial of a benefit in the bargaining process" can suffice for standing the Court relies ina footnote, see

ante, at 433, n. 22, on Northeastern Fla. Chap-ter, Associated Gen. Contractors of America v. Jacksonville,

508 U. S. 656 (1993). There, an association of contractorsalleged that a city ordinance according racial preferences
in the award of city contracts denied its members equalprotection of the laws.

and would have bid on designated set-aside contracts but forthe ordinance. Id., at 659. We held that the association had

Opinion of Scalia, J.
standing even without proof that its members would havebeen awarded contracts absent the challenged discrimination. The reason, we explained, is that "[t]he `injury in fact'in an equal protection case of this variety is the denial of
equal treatment resulting from the imposition of the barrier,
not the ultimate inability to obtain the benefit." Id., at 666,citing two earlier equal protection cases,

Turner v. Fouche,
396 U. S. 346, 362 (1970), and Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co.,488 U. S. 469, 493 (1989). In other words,

Northeastern
Florida did not hold, as the Court suggests, that harm toone's bargaining position is an "injury in fact," but rather

that, in an equal protection case, the denial of equal treatment is. Inasmuch as Snake River does not challenge the
Line Item Veto Act on equal protection grounds, Northeastern Florida is inapposite. And I know of no case outside
the equal protection field in which the mere detriment to
one's "bargaining position," as opposed to a demonstrated
loss of some bargain, has been held to confer standing. The
proposition that standing is established by the mere reduction in one's chances of receiving a financial benefit is contradicted by Simon v. Eastern Ky. Welfare Rights Organization, 426 U. S. 26 (1976), which held that low-income persons
who had been denied treatment at local hospitals lacked
standing to challenge an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) ruling that reduced the amount of charitable care necessary for
the hospitals to qualify for tax-exempt status. The situation
in that case was strikingly similar to the one before us here:
The denial of a tax benefit to a third party was alleged to
reduce the chances of a financial benefit to the plaintiffs.
And standing was denied.

But even if harm to one's bargaining position were a legally cognizable injury, Snake River has not alleged, as it
must, facts sufficient to demonstrate that it personally has
suffered that injury. See Warth v. Seldin, 422 U. S. 490, 502
(1975). In Eastern Ky. Welfare Rights, supra, the plaintiffs
at least had applied for the financial benefit which had alleg524US2 Unit: $U93 [09-11-00 13:25:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN

edly been rendered less likely of receipt; the present suit, bycontrast, resembles a complaint asserting that the plaintiff 's

chances of winning the lottery were reduced, filed by a plain-tiff who never bought a lottery ticket, or who tore it up before the winner was announced. Snake River has presented
no evidence to show that it was engaged in bargaining, andthat that bargaining was impaired by the President's cancellation of $ 968. The Court says that Snake River "was en-gaged in ongoing negotiations with the owner of a processing
plant who had expressed an interest in structuring a tax-deferred sale when the President canceled $ 968,"

ante, at
432. There is, however, no evidence of "negotiations," onlyof two "discussions." According to the affidavit of Mike

Cranney:

"On or about May 1997, I spoke with Howard Phillips,
the principal owner of Idaho Potato Packers, concern-ing the possibility that, if the Cooperative Tax Act

were passed, Snake River Potato Growers might purchase a Blackfoot, Idaho processing facility in a transac-tion that would allow the deferral of gain. Mr. Phillips

expressed an interest in such a transaction if the Co-operative Tax Act were to pass. Mr. Phillips also
acknowledged to me that Jim Chapman, our GeneralManager, had engaged him in a previous discussion concerning this matter." App. 112.
This affidavit would have set forth something of significance
if it had said that Phillips had expressed an interest in thetransaction "if

and only if the Cooperative Tax Act were to
pass." But of course it is most unlikely he said that; Idaho
Potato Packers (IPP) could get just as much from the sale
without the Act as with the Act, so long as the price was
right. The affidavit would also have set forth something of
significance if it had said that Phillips had expressed an interest in the sale "at a particular price if the Cooperative
Tax Act were to pass." But it does not say that either.

Opinion of Scalia, J.
Nor does it even say that the President's action caused IPPto reconsider. Moreover, it was Snake River, not IPP, that

terminated the discussions. According to Cranney, "[t]hePresident's cancellation of the Cooperative Tax Act caused
me to terminate discussions with Phillips about the possibility of Snake River Potato Growers buying the Idaho PotatoPackers facility."

Id., at 114. So all we know from the record is that Snake River had two discussions with IPP con-cerning the sale of its processing facility on the tax deferred

basis the Act would allow; that IPP was interested; and thatSnake River ended the discussions after the President's action. We do not know that Snake River was prepared to
offer a price--tax deferral or no--that would cross IPP's
laugh threshold. We do not even know for certain that the
tax deferral was a significant attraction to IPP; we know
only that Cranney thought it was. On these facts--which
never even bring things to the point of bargaining--it is pure
conjecture to say that Snake River suffered an impaired bargaining position. As we have said many times, conjectural
or hypothetical injuries do not suffice for Article III standing. See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 560
(1992).

Nor has Snake River demonstrated, as the Court finds,
that "the cancellation inflicted a sufficient likelihood of economic injury to establish standing under our precedents."
Ante, at 432. Presumably the economic injury the Court
has in mind is Snake River's loss of a bargain purchase of a
processing plant. But there is no evidence, and indeed not
even an allegation, that before the President's action such a
purchase was likely. The most that Snake River alleges is
that the President's action rendered it "more difficult for
plaintiffs to purchase qualified processors," App. 12. And
even if that abstract "increased difficulty" sufficed for
injury in fact (which it does not), the existence of even that
is pure speculation. For all that appears, no owner of a
processing plant would have been willing to sell to Snake

460 CLINTON v. CITY OF NEW YORK

Opinion of Scalia, J.
River at any price that Snake River could afford--and theimpossible cannot be made "more difficult." All we know is

that a potential seller was "interested" in talking about thesubject before the President's action, and that after the President's action Snake River itself decided to proceed no further. If this establishes a "likelihood" that Snake Riverwould have made a bargain purchase but for the President's

action, or even a "likelihood" that the President's actionrendered "more difficult" a purchase that was realistically
within Snake River's grasp, then we must adopt for ourstanding jurisprudence a new definition of likely: "plausible."

Twice before have we addressed whether plaintiffs had
standing to challenge the Government's tax treatment of a
third party, and twice before have we held that the speculative nature of a third party's response to changes in federal
tax laws defeats standing. In Simon v. Eastern Ky. Welfare
Rights, 426 U. S. 26 (1976), we found it "purely speculative
whether the denials of service . . . fairly can be traced to [the
IRS's] `encouragement' or instead result from decisions made
by the hospitals without regard to the tax implications."
Id., at 42-43. We found it "equally speculative whether the
desired exercise of the court's remedial powers in this suit
would result in the availability to respondents of such services." Id., at 43. In Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737 (1984),
we held that parents of black children attending public
schools lacked standing to challenge IRS policies concerning
tax exemptions for private schools. The parents alleged,
inter alia, that "federal tax exemptions to racially discriminatory private schools in their communities impair their ability to have their public schools desegregated." Id., at 752-
753. We concluded that "the injury alleged is not fairly
traceable to the Government conduct . . . challenge[d] as unlawful," id., at 757, and that "it is entirely speculative . . .
whether withdrawal of a tax exemption from any particular
school would lead the school to change its policies," id., at
758. Likewise, here, it is purely speculative whether a tax

461Cite as: 524 U. S. 417 (1998)
Opinion of Scalia, J.
deferral would have prompted any sale, let alone one thatreflected the tax benefit in the sale price.

The closest case the Court can appeal to as precedent forits finding of standing is

Bryant v. Yellen, 447 U. S. 352
(1980). Even on its own terms, Bryant is distinguishable.
As that case came to us, it involved a dispute between a classof some 800 landowners in the Imperial Valley, each of whom

owned more than 160 acres, and a group of Imperial Valleyresidents who wished to purchase lands owned by that class.
The point at issue was the application to those lands of astatutory provision that forbade delivery of water from a
federal reclamation project to irrigable land held by a single
owner in excess of 160 acres, and that limited the sale price
of any lands so held in excess of 160 acres to a maximum
amount, fixed by the Secretary of the Interior, based on fair
market value in 1929, before the valley was irrigated by
water from the Boulder Canyon Project. Id., at 366-367.
That price would of course be "far below [the lands'] current
market values." Id., at 367, n. 17. The Court concluded
that the would-be purchasers "had a sufficient stake in the
outcome of the controversy to afford them standing." Id.,
at 368. It is true, as the Court today emphasizes, that the
purchasers had not presented "detailed information about
[their] financial resources," but the Court thought that unnecessary only because "purchasers of such land would stand
to reap significant gains on resale." Id., at 367, n. 17. Financing, in other words, would be easy to come by. Here,
by contrast, not only do we have no notion whether Snake
River has the cash in hand to afford IPP's bottom-line price,
but we also have no reason to believe that financing of the
purchase will be readily available. Potato processing plants,
unlike agricultural land in the Imperial Valley, do not have
a readily available resale market. On the other side of the
equation, it was also much clearer in Bryant that if the suit
came out in the would-be purchasers' favor, many of the landowners would be willing to sell. The alternative would be

524US2 Unit: $U93 [09-11-00 13:25:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN
462 CLINTON v. CITY OF NEW YORK

Opinion of Scalia, J.
withdrawing the land from agricultural production, whereassale--even at bargain-basement prices for the land--would

at least enable recoupment of the cost of improvements, suchas drainage systems.

Ibid. In the present case, by contrast, we have no reason to believe that IPP is not operating
its processing plant at a profit, and will not continue to do soin the future; Snake River has proffered no evidence that

IPP or any other processor would surely have sold if onlythe President had not canceled the tax deferral. The only
uncertainty in Bryant was whether any of the respondentswould wind up as buyers of any of the excess land; that
seemed probable enough, since "respondents are residents of
the Imperial Valley who desire to purchase the excess land
for purposes of farming." Ibid. We have no basis to say
that it is "likely" that Snake River would have purchased a
processing facility if $ 968 had not been canceled.

More fundamentally, however, the reasoning of Bryant
should not govern the present case because it represents a
crabbed view of the standing doctrine that has been superseded. Bryant was decided at the tail-end of "an era in
which it was thought that the only function of the constitutional requirement of standing was `to assure that concrete
adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues,' "
Spencer v. Kemna, 523 U. S. 1, 11 (1998), quoting Baker v.
Carr, 369 U. S. 186, 204 (1962). Thus, the Bryant Court ultimately afforded the respondents standing simply because
they "had a sufficient stake in the outcome of the controversy," 447 U. S., at 368, not because they had demonstrated
injury in fact, causation, and redressability. "That parsimonious view of the function of Article III standing has since
yielded to the acknowledgment that the constitutional requirement is a `means of "defin[ing] the role assigned to the
judiciary in a tripartite allocation of power," ' and `a part of
the basic charter . . . provid[ing] for the interaction between
[the federal] government and the governments of the several
States,' " Spencer, supra, at 11-12, quoting Valley Forge

Opinion of Scalia, J.
Christian College v. Americans United for Separation ofChurch and State, Inc., 454 U. S. 464, 474, 476 (1982). While

Snake River in the present case may indeed have enough ofa "stake" to assure adverseness, the matter it brings before
us is inappropriate for our resolution because its allegationsdo not establish an injury in fact, attributable to the Presidential action it challenges, and remediable by this Court'sinvalidation of that Presidential action.

Because, in my view, Snake River has no standing to bringthis suit, we have no jurisdiction to resolve its challenge to
the President's authority to cancel a "limited tax benefit."

III
I agree with the Court that the New York appellees havestanding to challenge the President's cancellation of $ 4722(c)

of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 as an "item of new directspending." See

ante, at 430-431. The tax liability theywill incur under New York law is a concrete and particularized injury, fairly traceable to the President's action, andavoided if that action is undone. Unlike the Court, however,
I do not believe that Executive cancellation of this item ofdirect spending violates the Presentment Clause.

The Presentment Clause requires, in relevant part, that"[e]very Bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it become a Law, bepresented to the President of the United States; If he approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it." U. S.Const., Art. I, $ 7, cl. 2. There is no question that enactment
of the Balanced Budget Act complied with these require-ments: the House and Senate passed the bill, and the President signed it into law. It was only after the requirementsof the Presentment Clause had been satisfied that the President exercised his authority under the Line Item Veto Actto cancel the spending item. Thus, the Court's problem with
the Act is not that it authorizes the President to veto partsof a bill and sign others into law, but rather that it authorizes

464 CLINTON v. CITY OF NEW YORK

Opinion of Scalia, J.
him to "cancel"--prevent from "having legal force or ef-fect"--certain parts of duly enacted statutes.

Article I, $ 7, of the Constitution obviously prevents thePresident from canceling a law that Congress has not authorized him to cancel. Such action cannot possibly be considered part of his execution of the law, and if it is legislativeaction, as the Court observes, " `repeal of statutes, no less

than enactment, must conform with Art. I.' " Ante, at 438,quoting from

INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S. 919, 954 (1983). But
that is not this case. It was certainly arguable, as an origi-nal matter, that Art. I, $ 7, also prevents the President from

canceling a law which itself authorizes the President to cancel it. But as the Court acknowledges, that argument has
long since been made and rejected. In 1809, Congress
passed a law authorizing the President to cancel trade restrictions against Great Britain and France if either revoked
edicts directed at the United States. Act of Mar. 1, 1809,

$ 11, 2 Stat. 528. Joseph Story regarded the conferral of
that authority as entirely unremarkable in The Orono, 18
F. Cas. 830 (No. 10,585) (CCD Mass. 1812). The Tariff Act
of 1890 authorized the President to "suspend, by proclamation to that effect" certain of its provisions if he determined
that other countries were imposing "reciprocally unequal and
unreasonable" duties. Act of Oct. 1, 1890, $ 3, 26 Stat. 612.
This Court upheld the constitutionality of that Act in Field
v. Clark, 143 U. S. 649 (1892), reciting the history since 1798
of statutes conferring upon the President the power to, inter
alia, "discontinue the prohibitions and restraints hereby
enacted and declared," id., at 684, "suspend the operation of
the aforesaid act," id., at 685, and "declare the provisions of

this act to be inoperative," id., at 688.

As much as the Court goes on about Art. I, $ 7, therefore,
that provision does not demand the result the Court reaches.
It no more categorically prohibits the Executive reduction
of congressional dispositions in the course of implementing
statutes that authorize such reduction, than it categorically

524US2 Unit: $U93 [09-11-00 13:25:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN

465Cite as: 524 U. S. 417 (1998)
Opinion of Scalia, J.
prohibits the Executive augmentation of congressional dis-positions in the course of implementing statutes that authorize such augmentation--generally known as substantiverulemaking. There are, to be sure, limits upon the former
just as there are limits upon the latter--and I am prepared
to acknowledge that the limits upon the former may be muchmore severe. Those limits are established, however, not by

some categorical prohibition of Art. I, $ 7, which our casesconclusively disprove, but by what has come to be known
as the doctrine of unconstitutional delegation of legislativeauthority: When authorized Executive reduction or augmentation is allowed to go too far, it usurps the nondelegable
function of Congress and violates the separation of powers.

It is this doctrine, and not the Presentment Clause, that
was discussed in the Field opinion, and it is this doctrine,
and not the Presentment Clause, that is the issue presented
by the statute before us here. That is why the Court is
correct to distinguish prior authorizations of Executive cancellation, such as the one involved in Field, on the ground
that they were contingent upon an Executive finding of fact,
and on the ground that they related to the field of foreign
affairs, an area where the President has a special " `degree
of discretion and freedom,' " ante, at 445 (citation omitted).
These distinctions have nothing to do with whether the details of Art. I, $ 7, have been complied with, but everything
to do with whether the authorizations went too far by transferring to the Executive a degree of political, lawmaking
power that our traditions demand be retained by the Legislative Branch.

I turn, then, to the crux of the matter: whether Congress's
authorizing the President to cancel an item of spending gives
him a power that our history and traditions show must reside
exclusively in the Legislative Branch. I may note, to begin
with, that the Line Item Veto Act is not the first statute
to authorize the President to "cancel" spending items. In
Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U. S. 714 (1986), we addressed the

524US2 Unit: $U93 [09-11-00 13:25:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN
466 CLINTON v. CITY OF NEW YORK

Opinion of Scalia, J.
constitutionality of the Balanced Budget and EmergencyDeficit Control Act of 1985, 2 U. S. C. $ 901

et seq. (1982 ed.,
Supp. III), which required the President, if the federalbudget deficit exceeded a certain amount, to issue a "sequestration" order mandating spending reductions specified by
the Comptroller General, $ 902. The effect of sequestrationwas that "amounts sequestered . . . shall be

permanently
cancelled." $ 902(a)(4) (emphasis added). We held that theAct was unconstitutional, not because it impermissibly gave

the Executive legislative power, but because it gave theComptroller General, an officer of the Legislative Branch
over whom Congress retained removal power, "the ultimate
authority to determine the budget cuts to be made," 478
U. S., at 733, "functions . . . plainly entailing execution of
the law in constitutional terms," id., at 732-733 (emphasis
added). The President's discretion under the Line Item
Veto Act is certainly broader than the Comptroller General's
discretion was under the 1985 Act, but it is no broader than
the discretion traditionally granted the President in his execution of spending laws.

Insofar as the degree of political, "lawmaking" power conferred upon the Executive is concerned, there is not a dime's
worth of difference between Congress's authorizing the
President to cancel a spending item, and Congress's authorizing money to be spent on a particular item at the President's discretion. And the latter has been done since the
founding of the Nation. From 1789-1791, the First Congress made lump-sum appropriations for the entire Government--"sum[s] not exceeding" specified amounts for broad
purposes. Act of Sept. 29, 1789, ch. 23, 1 Stat. 95; Act of
Mar. 26, 1790, ch. 4, $ 1, 1 Stat. 104; Act of Feb. 11, 1791, ch.
6, 1 Stat. 190. From a very early date Congress also made
permissive individual appropriations, leaving the decision
whether to spend the money to the President's unfettered
discretion. In 1803, it appropriated $50,000 for the President to build "not exceeding fifteen gun boats, to be armed,

manned and fitted out, and employed for such purposes as inhis opinion the public service may require," Act of Feb. 28,

1803, ch. 11, $ 3, 2 Stat. 206. President Jefferson reportedthat "[t]he sum of fifty thousand dollars appropriated by Congress for providing gun boats remains unexpended. The favorable and peaceable turn of affairs on the Mississippi ren-dered an immediate execution of that law unnecessary," 13

Annals of Cong. 14 (1803). Examples of appropriations com-mitted to the discretion of the President abound in our history. During the Civil War, an Act appropriated over $76million to be divided among various items "as the exigencies
of the service may require," Act of Feb. 25, 1862, ch. 32, 12
Stat. 344-345. During the Great Depression, Congress appropriated $950 million "for such projects and/or purposes
and under such rules and regulations as the President in his
discretion may prescribe," Act of Feb. 15, 1934, ch. 13, 48
Stat. 351, and $4 billion for general classes of projects, the
money to be spent "in the discretion and under the direction
of the President," Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of
1935, 49 Stat. 115. The constitutionality of such appropriations has never seriously been questioned. Rather, "[t]hat
Congress has wide discretion in the matter of prescribing details of expenditures for which it appropriates must,
of course, be plain. Appropriations and other acts of Congress are replete with instances of general appropriations of
large amounts, to be allotted and expended as directed by
designated government agencies." Cincinnati Soap Co. v.
United States, 301 U. S. 308, 321-322 (1937).

Certain Presidents have claimed Executive authority to
withhold appropriated funds even absent an express conferral of discretion to do so. In 1876, for example, President
Grant reported to Congress that he would not spend money
appropriated for certain harbor and river improvements, see
Act of Aug. 14, 1876, ch. 267, 19 Stat. 132, because "[u]nder
no circumstances [would he] allow expenditures upon works
not clearly national," and in his view, the appropriations

were for "works of purely private or local interest, in nosense national," 4 Cong. Rec. 5628. President Franklin D.

Roosevelt impounded funds appropriated for a flood controlreservoir and levee in Oklahoma. See Act of Aug. 18, 1941,
ch. 377, 55 Stat. 638, 645; Hearings on S. 373 before the Ad
Hoc Subcommittee on Impoundment of Funds of the Com-mittee on Government Operations and the Subcommittee on

Separation of Powers of the Senate Committee on the Judi-ciary, 93d Cong., 1st Sess., 848-849 (1973). President Truman ordered the impoundment of hundreds of millions of dol-lars that had been appropriated for military aircraft. See
Act of Oct. 29, 1949, ch. 787, 63 Stat. 987, 1013; Public Papers
of the Presidents of the United States, Harry S. Truman,
1949, pp. 538-539 (W. Reid ed. 1964). President Nixon, the
Mahatma Gandhi of all impounders, asserted at a press conference in 1973 that his "constitutional right" to impound
appropriated funds was "absolutely clear." The President's
News Conference of Jan. 31, 1973, 9 Weekly Comp. of Pres.
Doc. 109-110 (1973). Our decision two years later in Train
v. City of New York, 420 U. S. 35 (1975), proved him wrong,
but it implicitly confirmed that Congress may confer discretion upon the Executive to withhold appropriated funds,
even funds appropriated for a specific purpose. The statute
at issue in Train authorized spending "not to exceed" specified sums for certain projects, and directed that such "[s]ums
authorized to be appropriated . . . shall be allotted" by the
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, 33
U. S. C. $$ 1285, 1287 (1970 ed., Supp. III). Upon enactment
of this statute, the President directed the Administrator to
allot no more than a certain part of the amount authorized.
420 U. S., at 40. This Court held, as a matter of statutory
interpretation, that the statute did not grant the Executive
discretion to withhold the funds, but required allotment of
the full amount authorized. Id., at 44-47.

The short of the matter is this: Had the Line Item Veto
Act authorized the President to "decline to spend" any item

Breyer, J., dissenting
of spending contained in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997,there is not the slightest doubt that authorization would

have been constitutional. What the Line Item Veto Actdoes instead--authorizing the President to "cancel" an item
of spending--is technically different. But the technical dif-ference does

not relate to the technicalities of the Present-ment Clause, which have been fully complied with; and the

doctrine of unconstitutional delegation, which is at issuehere, is preeminently not a doctrine of technicalities. The
title of the Line Item Veto Act, which was perhaps designedto simplify for public comprehension, or perhaps merely to
comply with the terms of a campaign pledge, has succeededin faking out the Supreme Court. The President's action it
authorizes in fact is not a line-item veto and thus does notoffend Art. I, $ 7; and insofar as the substance of that action
is concerned, it is no different from what Congress has per-mitted the President to do since the formation of the Union.

IV
I would hold that the President's cancellation of $ 4722(c)of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 as an item of direct

spending does not violate the Constitution. Because I findno party before us who has standing to challenge the President's cancellation of $ 968 of the Taxpayer Relief Act of1997, I do not reach the question whether that violates the
Constitution.For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.

Justice Scalia join as to Part III, dissenting.

separation-of-powers principle. Consequently, I believe thatthe Act is constitutional.

II
I approach the constitutional question before us with threegeneral considerations in mind.

First, the Act represents alegislative effort to provide the President with the power to

give effect to some, but not to all, of the expenditure andrevenue-diminishing provisions contained in a single massive
appropriations bill. And this objective is constitutionallyproper.

When our Nation was founded, Congress could easily haveprovided the President with this kind of power. In that
time period, our population was less than 4 million, see U. S.Dept. of Commerce, Census Bureau, Historical Statistics of
the United States: Colonial Times to 1970, pt. 1, p. 8 (1975),federal employees numbered fewer than 5,000, see id., pt. 2,
at 1103, annual federal budget outlays totaled approximately$4 million, see id., pt. 2, at 1104, and the entire operative
text of Congress' first general appropriations law read asfollows:

"Be it enacted . . . [t]hat there be appropriated for theservice of the present year, to be paid out of the monies
which arise, either from the requisitions heretoforemade upon the several states, or from the duties on import and tonnage, the following sums, viz. A sum notexceeding two hundred and sixteen thousand dollars for
defraying the expenses of the civil list, under the lateand present government; a sum not exceeding one hundred and thirty-seven thousand dollars for defraying theexpenses of the department of war; a sum not exceeding
one hundred and ninety thousand dollars for dischargingthe warrants issued by the late board of treasury, and
remaining unsatisfied; and a sum not exceeding ninety-six thousand dollars for paying the pensions to invalids."
Act of Sept. 29, 1789, ch. 23, $ 1, 1 Stat. 95.

Breyer, J., dissenting
At that time, a Congress, wishing to give a President the
power to select among appropriations, could simply have embodied each appropriation in a separate bill, each bill subject
to a separate Presidential veto.

Today, however, our population is about 250 million, see
U. S. Dept. of Commerce, Census Bureau, 1990 Census, the
Federal Government employs more than 4 million people, see
Office of Management and Budget, Budget of the United
States Government, Fiscal Year 1998: Analytical Perspectives 207 (1997) (hereinafter Analytical Perspectives), the
annual federal budget is $1.5 trillion, see Office of Management and Budget, Budget of the United States Government,
Fiscal Year 1998: Budget 303 (1997) (hereinafter Budget),
and a typical budget appropriations bill may have a dozen
titles, hundreds of sections, and spread across more than 500
pages of the Statutes at Large. See, e. g., Balanced Budget
Act of 1997, Pub. L. 105-33, 111 Stat. 251. Congress cannot
divide such a bill into thousands, or tens of thousands, of
separate appropriations bills, each one of which the President would have to sign, or to veto, separately. Thus, the
question is whether the Constitution permits Congress to
choose a particular novel means to achieve this same, constitutionally legitimate, end.

Second, the case in part requires us to focus upon the Constitution's generally phrased structural provisions, provisions that delegate all "legislative" power to Congress and
vest all "executive" power in the President. See Part IV,
infra. The Court, when applying these provisions, has interpreted them generously in terms of the institutional arrangements that they permit. See, e. g., Mistretta v. United
States, 488 U. S. 361, 412 (1989) (upholding delegation of authority to Sentencing Commission to promulgate Sentencing
Guidelines); Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S. 22, 53-54 (1932)
(permitting non-Article III commission to adjudicate factual

disputes arising under federal dock workers' compensationstatute). See generally,

e. g., OPP Cotton Mills, Inc. v. Administrator of Wage and Hour Div., Dept. of Labor, 312 U. S.126, 145 (1941) ("In an increasingly complex society Congress

obviously could not perform its functions" without delegating details of regulatory scheme to executive agency);
Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579, 635
(1952) (Jackson, J., concurring) (Constitution permits "in-terdependence" and flexible relations between branches in

order to secure "workable government"); J. W. Hampton,
Jr., & Co. v. United States, 276 U. S. 394, 406 (1928) (Taft,
C. J.) ("[T]he extent and character of . . . assistance [betweenthe different branches] must be fixed according to common

sense and the inherent necessities of the governmental coordination"); Crowell v. Benson, supra, at 53 ("[R]egard mustbe had" in cases "where constitutional limits are invoked,

not to mere matters of form but to the substance of whatis required").

Indeed, Chief Justice Marshall, in a well-known passage,explained,

"To have prescribed the means by which governmentshould, in all future time, execute its powers, would
have been to change, entirely, the character of the in-strument, and give it the properties of a legal code. It
would have been an unwise attempt to provide, by im-mutable rules, for exigencies which, if foreseen at all,
must have been seen dimly, and which can be best provided for as they occur." McCulloch v. Maryland, 4Wheat. 316, 415 (1819).

This passage, like the cases I have just mentioned, calls attention to the genius of the Framers' pragmatic vision, which
this Court has long recognized in cases that find constitutional room for necessary institutional innovation.

Third, we need not here referee a dispute among the other
two branches. And, as the majority points out:

" `When this Court is asked to invalidate a statutory pro-vision that has been approved by both Houses of the

Congress and signed by the President, particularly anAct of Congress that confronts a deeply vexing national
problem, it should only do so for the most compelling
constitutional reasons.' " Ante, at 447, n. 42 (quoting
Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U. S. 714, 736 (1986) (Stevens,
J., concurring in judgment)).

Cf. Youngstown Sheet and Tube Co., supra, at 635 (Jackson,J., concurring) ("Presidential powers are not fixed but fluctuate, depending on their disjunction or conjunction with
those of Congress . . . [and when] the President acts pursuantto an express or implied authorization of Congress, his authority is at its maximum").These three background circumstances mean that, when
one measures the literal words of the Act against the Consti-tution's

literal commands, the fact that the Act may closely
resemble a different, literally unconstitutional, arrangementis beside the point. To drive exactly 65 miles per hour on

an interstate highway closely resembles an act that violates
the speed limit. But it does not violate that limit, for smalldifferences matter when the question is one of literal violation of law. No more does this Act literally violate the Con-stitution's words. See Part III,

infra.
The background circumstances also mean that we are tointerpret nonliteral separation-of-powers principles in light

of the need for "workable government." Youngstown Sheet
and Tube Co., supra, at 635 (Jackson, J., concurring). If we
apply those principles in light of that objective, as this Court
has applied them in the past, the Act is constitutional. See
Part IV, infra.

III

The Court believes that the Act violates the literal text
of the Constitution. A simple syllogism captures its basic
reasoning:

524US2 Unit: $U93 [09-11-00 13:25:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN
474 CLINTON v. CITY OF NEW YORK

Breyer, J., dissenting
Major Premise: The Constitution sets forth an exclusivemethod for enacting, repealing, or amending laws. See

ante, at 438-440.
Minor Premise: The Act authorizes the President to "re-pea[l] or amen[d]" laws in a different way, namely by

announcing a cancellation of a portion of a previouslyenacted law. See ante, at 436-438.

Conclusion: The Act is inconsistent with the Constitu-tion. See ante, at 448-449.

I find this syllogism unconvincing, however, because itsMinor Premise is faulty. When the President "canceled" the
two appropriation measures now before us, he did not repealany law nor did he amend any law. He simply followed
the law, leaving the statutes, as they are literally written,intact.

To understand why one cannot say, literally speaking, thatthe President has repealed or amended any law, imagine how
the provisions of law before us might have been, but werenot, written. Imagine that the canceled New York health
care tax provision at issue here, Pub. L. 105-33, $ 4722(c),111 Stat. 515 (quoted in full

ante, at 422-423, n. 2), had in-stead said the following:

"Section One. Taxes . . . that were collected by theState of New York from a health care provider before
June 1, 1997, and for which a waiver of the provisions[requiring payment] have been sought . . . are deemed
to be permissible health care related taxes . . . provided
however that the President may prevent the just-mentioned provision from having legal force or effect

if he determines x, y, and z" (Assume x, y, and z tobe the same determinations required by the Line Item
Veto Act).
Whatever a person might say, or think, about the constitu-tionality of this imaginary law, there is one thing the English

language would prevent one from saying. One could not saythat a President who "prevent[s]" the deeming language

524US2 Unit: $U93 [09-11-00 13:25:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Breyer, J., dissenting
from "having legal force or effect," see 2 U. S. C. $ 691e(4)(B)(1994 ed., Supp. II), has either

repealed or amended this
particular hypothetical statute. Rather, the President has
followed that law to the letter. He has exercised the power
it explicitly delegates to him. He has executed the law, not
repealed it.It could make no significant difference to this linguistic

point were the italicized proviso to appear, not as part ofwhat I have called Section One, but, instead, at the bottom
of the statute page, say, referenced by an asterisk, with astatement that it applies to every spending provision in the
Act next to which a similar asterisk appears. And thatbeing so, it could make no difference if that proviso appeared,
instead, in a different, earlier enacted law, along with legal
language that makes it applicable to every future spendingprovision picked out according to a specified formula. See,

e. g., Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act), Pub. L. 99-177, 99 Stat.
1063, 2 U. S. C. $ 901 et seq. (enforcing strict spending anddeficit-neutrality limits on future appropriations statutes);
see also 1 U. S. C. $ 1 (in "any Act of Congress" singularwords include plural, and vice versa) (emphasis added).

But, of course, this last mentioned possibility is this very
case. The earlier law, namely, the Line Item Veto Act, says
that "the President may . . . prevent such [future] budget
authority from having legal force or effect." 2 U. S. C.

$$ 691(a), 691e(4)(B) (1994 ed., Supp. II). Its definitional sections make clear that it applies to the 1997 New York health
care provision, see $ 691e(8), just as they give a special legal
meaning to the word "cancel," $ 691e(4). For that reason,
one cannot dispose of this case through a purely literal analysis as the majority does. Literally speaking, the President
has not "repealed" or "amended" anything. He has simply
executed a power conferred upon him by Congress, which
power is contained in laws that were enacted in compliance
with the exclusive method set forth in the Constitution.
See Field v. Clark, 143 U. S. 649, 693 (1892) (President's

Breyer, J., dissenting
power to raise tariff rates "was a part of the law itself, as it
left the hands of Congress" (emphasis added)).

Nor can one dismiss this literal compliance as some kindof formal quibble, as if it were somehow "obvious" that what

the President has done "amounts to," "comes close to," or

is "analogous to" the repeal or amendment of a previouslyenacted law. That is because the power the Act grants the

President (to render designated appropriations items with-out "legal force or effect") also "amounts to," "comes close
to," or is "analogous to" a different legal animal, the delega-tion of a power to choose one legal path as opposed to another, such as a power to appoint.

To take a simple example, a legal document, say, a will or
a trust instrument, might grant a beneficiary the power (a)
to appoint property "to Jones for his life, remainder to Smith
for 10 years so long as Smith . . . etc., and then to Brown,"
or (b) to appoint the same property "to Black and the heirs
of his body," or (c) not to exercise the power of appointment
at all. See, e. g., 5 W. Bowe & D. Parker, Page on Law of
Wills $ 45.8 (rev. 3d ed. 1962) (describing power of appointment). To choose the second or third of these alternatives
prevents from taking effect the legal consequences that flow
from the first alternative, which the legal instrument describes in detail. Any such choice, made in the exercise of
a delegated power, renders that first alternative language
without "legal force or effect." But such a choice does not
"repeal" or "amend" either that language or the document
itself. The will or trust instrument, in delegating the power
of appointment, has not delegated a power to amend or to
repeal the instrument; to the contrary, it requires the delegated power to be exercised in accordance with the instrument's terms. Id., $ 45.9, pp. 516-518.

The trust example is useful not merely because of its simplicity, but also because it illustrates the logic that must
apply when a power to execute is conferred, not by a private
trust document, but by a federal statute. This is not the

first time that Congress has delegated to the President or toothers this kind of power--a contingent power to deny effect

to certain statutory language. See, e. g., Pub. L. 95-384,$ 13(a), 92 Stat. 737 ("Section 620(x) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 shall be of no further force and effect upon
the President's determination and certification to the Con-gress that the resumption of full military cooperation with

management . . . [or] the protection of national or locally-affected interests, or protection of any cultural, biological or

historic resources").All of these examples, like the Act, delegate a power to
take action that will render statutory provisions "withoutforce or effect." Every one of these examples, like the present Act, delegates the power to choose between alternatives,
each of which the statute spells out in some detail. None of
these examples delegates a power to "repeal" or "amend" a
statute, or to "make" a new law. Nor does the Act. Rather,
the delegated power to nullify statutory language was itself
created and defined by Congress, and included in the statute
books on an equal footing with (indeed, as a component part
of) the sections that are potentially subject to nullification.
As a Pennsylvania court put the matter more than a century
ago: "The legislature cannot delegate its power to make a
law; but it can make a law to delegate a power." Locke's
Appeal, 72 Pa. 491, 498 (1873).

In fact, a power to appoint property offers a closer analogy
to the power delegated here than one might at first suspect.
That is because the Act contains a "lockbox" feature, which
gives legal significance to the enactment of a particular appropriations item even if, and even after, the President has
rendered it without "force or effect." See 2 U. S. C. $ 691c
(1994 ed., Supp. II); see also ante, at 440-441, n. 31 (describing "lockbox"); but cf. Letter from Counsel for Snake River
Cooperative, dated Apr. 29, 1998 (available in Clerk of
Court's case file) (arguing "lockbox" feature inapplicable here
due to special provision in Balanced Budget Act of 1997, the
constitutionality and severability of which have not been
argued). In essence, the "lockbox" feature: (1) points to a

524US2 Unit: $U93 [09-11-00 13:25:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN

479Cite as: 524 U. S. 417 (1998)
Breyer, J., dissenting
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act requirement that, when Con-gress enacts a "budget busting" appropriation bill, automatically reduces authorized spending for a host of federal pro-grams in a pro rata way; (2) notes that cancellation of an item
(say, a $2 billion item) would, absent the "lockbox" provision,
neutralize (by up to $2 billion) the potential "budget bust-ing" effects of other bills (and therefore potentially the President could cancel items in order to "save" the other pro-grams from the mandatory cuts, resulting in no net deficit
reduction); and (3) says that this "neutralization" will notoccur (

i. e., the pro rata reductions will take place just as if
the $2 billion item had not been canceled), so that the canceled items truly provide additional budget savings over
and above the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings regime. See generally H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 104-491, pp. 23-24 (1996) ("lockbox" provision included "to ensure that the savings from the
cancellation of [items] are devoted to deficit reduction and
are not available to offset a deficit increase in another law").
That is why the Government says that the Act provides a
"lockbox," and why it seems fair to say that, despite the Act's
use of the word "cancel," the Act does not delegate to the
President the power truly to cancel a line item expenditure
(returning the legal status quo to one in which the item had
never been enacted). Rather, it delegates to the President
the power to decide how to spend the money to which the
line item refers--either for the specific purpose mentioned
in the item, or for general deficit reduction via the "lockbox" feature.

These features of the law do not mean that the delegated
power is, or is just like, a power to appoint property. But
they do mean that it is not, and it is not just like, the repeal
or amendment of a law, or, for that matter, a true line item
veto (despite the Act's title). Because one cannot say that
the President's exercise of the power the Act grants is, literally speaking, a "repeal" or "amendment," the fact that the
Act's procedures differ from the Constitution's exclusive pro524US2 Unit: $U93 [09-11-00 13:25:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN
480 CLINTON v. CITY OF NEW YORK

Breyer, J., dissenting
cedures for enacting (or repealing) legislation is beside thepoint. The Act itself was enacted in accordance with these

procedures, and its failure to require the President to satisfythose procedures does not make the Act unconstitutional.

IV
Because I disagree with the Court's holding of literal viola-tion, I must consider whether the Act nonetheless violates

separation-of-powers principles--principles that arise out ofthe Constitution's vesting of the "executive Power" in "a
President," U. S. Const., Art. II, $ 1, and "[a]ll legislativePowers" in "a Congress," Art. I, $ 1. There are three relevant separation-of-powers questions here: (1) Has Congressgiven the President the wrong kind of power,

i. e., "non-Executive" power? (2) Has Congress given the President the

power to "encroach" upon Congress' own constitutionallyreserved territory? (3) Has Congress given the President
too much power, violating the doctrine of "nondelegation?"These three limitations help assure "adequate control by the
citizen's Representatives in Congress," upon which Justice
Kennedy properly insists. See ante, at 451 (concurringopinion). And with respect to

this Act, the answer to allthese questions is "no."

A
Viewed conceptually, the power the Act conveys is theright kind of power. It is "executive." As explained above,

an exercise of that power "executes" the Act. Conceptuallyspeaking, it closely resembles the kind of delegated authority--to spend or not to spend appropriations, to change ornot to change tariff rates--that Congress has frequently
granted the President, any differences being differences indegree, not kind. See Part IV-C, infra.

The fact that one could also characterize this kind of poweras "legislative," say, if Congress itself (by amending the appropriations bill) prevented a provision from taking effect, isbeside the point. This Court has frequently found that the

exercise of a particular power, such as the power to makerules of broad applicability,

American Trucking Assns., Inc.
v. United States, 344 U. S. 298, 310-313 (1953), or to adjudi-cate claims,

Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S., at 50-51, 54; Wiener v. United States, 357 U. S. 349, 354-356 (1958), can fall
within the constitutional purview of more than one branchof Government. See

Wayman v. Southard, 10 Wheat. 1, 43
(1825) (Marshall, C. J.) ("Congress may certainly delegate toothers, powers which the legislature may rightfully exercise

itself "). The Court does not "carry out the distinction be-tween legislative and executive action with mathematical
precision" or "divide the branches into watertight compartments," Springer v. Philippine Islands, 277 U. S. 189, 211
(1928) (Holmes, J., dissenting), for, as others have said, the
Constitution "blend[s]" as well as "separat[es]" powers in
order to create a workable government. 1 K. Davis, Administrative Law $ 1.09, p. 68 (1958).

The Court has upheld congressional delegation of rulemaking power and adjudicatory power to federal agencies,
American Trucking Assns. v. United States, supra, at 310-
313; Wiener v. United States, supra, at 354-356, guidelinewriting power to a Sentencing Commission, Mistretta v.
United States, 488 U. S., at 412, and prosecutor-appointment
power to judges, Morrison v. Olson, 487 U. S. 654, 696-697
(1988). It is far easier conceptually to reconcile the power
at issue here with the relevant constitutional description
("executive") than in many of these cases. And cases in
which the Court may have found a delegated power and
the basic constitutional function of another branch conceptually irreconcilable are yet more distant. See, e. g., Federal
Radio Comm'n v. General Elec. Co., 281 U. S. 464 (1930)
(power to award radio licenses not a "judicial" power).

If there is a separation-of-powers violation, then, it must
rest, not upon purely conceptual grounds, but upon some
important conflict between the Act and a significant
separation-of-powers objective.

The Act does not undermine what this Court has oftendescribed as the principal function of the separation of powers, which is to maintain the tripartite structure of the Fed-eral Government--and thereby protect individual liberty--
by providing a "safeguard against the encroachment oraggrandizement of one branch at the expense of the other."
Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 122 (1976) (per curiam); Mistretta v. United States, supra, at 380-382. See The Federal-ist No. 51, p. 349 (J. Cooke ed. 1961) (J. Madison) (separation

of powers confers on each branch the means "to resist en-croachments of the others"); 1 Davis,

supra, $ 1.09, at 68("The danger is not blended power[;] [t]he danger is unchecked power"); see also, e. g., Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U. S.714 (1986) (invalidating congressional intrusion on Executive
Branch); Northern Pipeline Constr. Co. v. Marathon Pipe
Line Co., 458 U. S. 50 (1982) (Congress may not give awayArticle III "judicial" power to an Article I judge); Myers

v. United States, 272 U. S. 52 (1926) (Congress cannot limitPresident's power to remove Executive Branch official).

In contrast to these cases, one cannot say that the Act"encroaches" upon Congress' power, when Congress retained
the power to insert, by simple majority, into any future ap-propriations bill, into any section of any such bill, or into any
phrase of any section, a provision that says the Act will notapply. See 2 U. S. C. $ 691f(c)(1) (1994 ed., Supp. II);

Rainesv. Byrd, 521 U. S. 811, 824 (1997) (Congress can "exempt a

given appropriations bill (or a given provision in an appropri-ations bill) from the Act"). Congress also retained the
power to "disapprov[e]," and thereby reinstate, any of thePresident's cancellations. See 2 U. S. C. $ 691b(a). And it
is Congress that drafts and enacts the appropriations stat-utes that are subject to the Act in the first place--and
thereby defines the outer limits of the President's cancella-tion authority. Thus

this Act is not the sort of delegation"without . . . sufficient check" that concerns

Justice Ken524US2 Unit: $U93 [09-11-00 13:25:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN

nedy. See ante, at 450 (concurring opinion). Indeed, thePresident acts only in response to, and on the terms set by,

the Congress.Nor can one say that the Act's basic substantive objective
is constitutionally improper, for the earliest Congresses
could, see Part II, supra, and often did, confer on the Presi-dent this sort of discretionary authority over spending, see

ante, at 466-467 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissent-ing in part). Cf.

J. W. Hampton, 276 U. S., at 412 (Taft, C. J.)
("[C]ontemporaneous legislative exposition of the Constitu-tion when the founders of our Government and the framers

of our Constitution were actively participating in public affairs . . . fixes the construction to be given to its provisions").
And, if an individual Member of Congress, who, say, favors
aid to Country A but not to Country B, objects to the Act on
the ground that the President may "rewrite" an appropriations law to do the opposite, one can respond: "But a majority
of Congress voted that he have that power; you may vote to
exempt the relevant appropriations provision from the Act;
and if you command a majority, your appropriation is safe."
Where the burden of overcoming legislative inertia lies is
within the power of Congress to determine by rule. Where
is the encroachment?

Nor can one say the Act's grant of power "aggrandizes"
the Presidential office. The grant is limited to the context
of the budget. It is limited to the power to spend, or not to
spend, particular appropriated items, and the power to permit, or not to permit, specific limited exemptions from generally applicable tax law from taking effect. These powers,
as I will explain in detail, resemble those the President has
exercised in the past on other occasions. See Part IV-C,
infra. The delegation of those powers to the President may
strengthen the Presidency, but any such change in Executive
Branch authority seems minute when compared with the
changes worked by delegations of other kinds of authority
that the Court in the past has upheld. See, e. g., American

The "nondelegation" doctrine represents an added constitutional check upon Congress' authority to delegate power
to the Executive Branch. And it raises a more serious constitutional obstacle here. The Constitution permits Congress to "see[k] assistance from another branch" of Government, the "extent and character" of that assistance to be
fixed "according to common sense and the inherent necessities of the governmental co-ordination." J. W. Hampton,
supra, at 406. But there are limits on the way in which
Congress can obtain such assistance; it "cannot delegate any
part of its legislative power except under the limitation of
a prescribed standard." United States v. Chicago, M., St. P.
& P. R. Co., 282 U. S. 311, 324 (1931). Or, in Chief Justice
Taft's more familiar words, the Constitution permits only
those delegations where Congress "shall lay down by legislative act an intelligible principle to which the person or body
authorized to [act] is directed to conform." J. W. Hampton,
supra, at 409 (emphasis added).

The Act before us seeks to create such a principle in three
ways. The first is procedural. The Act tells the President

The second is purposive. The clear purpose behind theAct, confirmed by its legislative history, is to promote
"greater fiscal accountability" and to "eliminate wastefulfederal spending and . . . special tax breaks." H. R. Conf.
Rep. No. 104-491, p. 15 (1996).The third is substantive. The President must determine
that, to "prevent" the item or amount "from having legalforce or effect" will "reduce the Federal budget deficit; . . .
not impair any essential Government functions; and . . . notharm the national interest." 2 U. S. C. $ 691(a)(A) (1994 ed.,
Supp. II).The resulting standards are broad. But this Court has
upheld standards that are equally broad, or broader. See,
e. g., National Broadcasting Co. v. United States, 319 U. S.190, 225-226 (1943) (upholding delegation to Federal Communications Commission to regulate broadcast licensing as"public interest, convenience, or necessity" require) (internal

United States v. Rock Royal Co-operative, Inc., 307U. S. 533, 577 (1939) (if milk prices were "unreasonable," Secretary of Agriculture could "fi[x]" prices to a level that was"in the public interest"). See also

gation" doctrine. One such case, Panama Refining Co. v.Ryan, 293 U. S. 388 (1935), was in a sense a special case, for

it was discovered in the midst of the case that the particularexercise of the power at issue, the promulgation of a Petroleum Code under the National Industrial Recovery Act, didnot contain any legally operative sentence.

Id., at 412-413.The other case, A. L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United

States, 295 U. S. 495 (1935), involved a delegation throughthe National Industrial Recovery Act, 48 Stat. 195, that contained not simply a broad standard ("fair competition"), butalso the conferral of power on private parties to promulgate
rules applying that standard to virtually all of American in-dustry,

id., at 521-525. As Justice Cardozo put it, the legis-lation exemplified "delegation running riot," which created a

"roving commission to inquire into evils and upon discoverycorrect them." Id., at 553, 551 (concurring opinion).

The case before us does not involve any such "roving com-mission," nor does it involve delegation to private parties,
nor does it bring all of American industry within its scope.It is limited to one area of Government, the budget, and it
seeks to give the President the power, in one portion of thatbudget, to tailor spending and special tax relief to what he
concludes are the demands of fiscal responsibility. Nor isthe standard that governs his judgment, though broad, any
broader than the standard that currently governs the awardof television licenses, namely, "public convenience, interest,
or necessity." 47 U. S. C. $ 303 (emphasis added). To thecontrary, (a) the broadly phrased limitations in the Act, together with (b) its evident deficit reduction purpose, and (c)a procedure that guarantees Presidential awareness of the
reasons for including a particular provision in a budget bill,taken together, guide the President's exercise of his discretionary powers. 1

The relevant similarities and differences among and be-tween this case and other "nondelegation" cases can be listed

Breyer, J., dissenting
more systematically as follows: First, as I have just said,like statutes delegating power to award broadcast television

licenses, or to regulate the securities industry, or to developand enforce workplace safety rules, the Act is aimed at a
discrete problem: namely, a particular set of expenditures
within the federal budget. The Act concerns, not the entireeconomy, cf.

Schecter Poultry Corp., supra, but the annual
federal budget. Within the budget it applies only to discretionary budget authority and new direct spending items,
that together amount to approximately a third of the currentannual budget outlays, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 18; see also

Budget 303, and to "limited tax benefits" that (because each
can affect no more than 100 people, see 2 U. S. C. $ 691e(9)(A)
(1994 ed., Supp. II)), amount to a tiny fraction of federal revenues and appropriations. Compare Analytical Perspectives 73-75 (listing over $500 billion in overall "tax expenditures" that OMB estimated were contained in federal law in
1997) and Budget 303 (federal outlays and receipts in 1997
were both over $1.5 trillion) with App. to Juris. Statement
71a (President's cancellation message for Snake River appellees' limited tax benefit, estimating annual "value" of benefit,
in terms of revenue loss, at about $20 million).

Second, like the award of television licenses, the particular
problem involved--determining whether or not a particular
amount of money should be spent or whether a particular
dispensation from tax law should be granted a few individuals--does not readily lend itself to a significantly more
specific standard. The Act makes clear that the President
should consider the reasons for the expenditure, measure
those reasons against the desirability of avoiding a deficit (or
building a surplus), and make up his mind about the comparative weight of these conflicting goals. Congress might
have expressed this matter in other language, but could
it have done so in a significantly more specific way? See
National Broadcasting Co. v. United States, supra, at 216
("[P]ublic interest, convenience, or necessity" standard is

524US2 Unit: $U93 [09-11-00 13:25:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN
488 CLINTON v. CITY OF NEW YORK

Breyer, J., dissenting
" `as concrete as the complicated factors for judgment in such
a field of delegated authority permit' ") (quoting FCC v.
Pottsville Broadcasting Co., 309 U. S. 134, 138 (1940)). The
statute's language, I believe, is sufficient to provide the President, and the public, with a fairly clear idea as to what Congress had in mind. And the public can judge the merits of
the President's choices accordingly. Cf. Yakus v. United
States, 321 U. S., at 426 (standards were "sufficiently definite
and precise to enable . . . the public to ascertain . . .
conform[ity]").

Third, insofar as monetary expenditure (but not "tax expenditure") is at issue, the President acts in an area where
history helps to justify the discretionary power that Congress has delegated, and where history may inform his exercise of the Act's delegated authority. Congress has frequently delegated the President the authority to spend, or
not to spend, particular sums of money. See, e. g., Act of
Sept. 29, 1789, ch. 23, 1 Stat. 95; Act of Mar. 26, 1790, ch. 4,

$ 1, 1 Stat. 104; Act of Feb. 11, 1791, ch. 6, 1 Stat. 190; Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935, 49 Stat. 115 (appropriating over $4 billion to be spent "in the discretion and
under the direction of the President" for economic relief
measures); see also ante, at 466-467 (Scalia, J., concurring
in part and dissenting in part) (listing numerous examples).

Fourth, the Constitution permits Congress to rely upon
context and history as providing the necessary standard for
the exercise of the delegated power. See, e. g., Federal
Radio Comm'n v. Nelson Brothers Bond & Mortgage Co.
(Station WIBO), 289 U. S. 266, 285 (1933) ("public interest,
convenience, or necessity [standard] . . . is to be interpreted
by its context"); Fahey v. Mallonee, 332 U. S. 245, 253 (1947)
(otherwise vague delegation to regulate banks was "sufficiently explicit, against the background of custom, to be adequate"). Relying upon context, Congress has sometimes
granted the President broad discretionary authority over

524US2 Unit: $U93 [09-11-00 13:25:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN

489Cite as: 524 U. S. 417 (1998)
Breyer, J., dissenting
spending in laws that mention no standard at all. See, e. g.,
Act of Mar. 3, 1809, ch. 28, $ 1, 2 Stat. 535-536 (granting the
President recess authority to transfer money "appropriated
for a particular branch of expenditure in [a] department" to
be "applied [instead] to another branch of expenditure in the
same department"); Revenue and Expenditure Control Act
of 1968, $$ 202(b), 203(b), 82 Stat. 271-272; (authorizing the
President annually to reserve up to $6 billion in outlays and
$10 billion in new obligation authority); Second Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1969, $ 401, 83 Stat. 82; Second Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1970, $$ 401, 501, 84 Stat. 405-
407. In this case, too, context and purpose can give meaning
to highly general language. See Federal Radio Comm'n v.
Nelson Bros., supra, at 285; Fahey v. Malonee, supra, at
250-253; cf. Lichter v. United States, 334 U. S., at 777 (Congress has "at least expressed . . . satisfaction with the existing specificity of the Act"); Train v. City of New York, 420
U. S. 35, 44-47 (1975) (disallowing President Nixon's efforts
to impound funds because Court found Congress did not intend him to exercise the power in that instance).

On the other hand, I must recognize that there are important differences between the delegation before us and other
broad, constitutionally acceptable delegations to Executive
Branch agencies--differences that argue against my conclusion. In particular, a broad delegation of authority to an
administrative agency differs from the delegation at issue
here in that agencies often develop subsidiary rules under
the statute, rules that explain the general "public interest"
language. Doing so diminishes the risk that the agency will
use the breadth of a grant of authority as a cloak for unreasonable or unfair implementation. See 1 K. Davis, Administrative Law $ 3:15, pp. 207-208 (2d ed. 1978). Moreover,
agencies are typically subject to judicial review, which review provides an additional check against arbitrary implementation. See, e. g., Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United

490 CLINTON v. CITY OF NEW YORK

Breyer, J., dissenting
States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., 463U. S. 29, 40-42 (1983). The President has not so narrowed

his discretionary power through rule, nor is his implemen-tation subject to judicial review under the terms of the Administrative Procedure Act. See, e. g., Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U. S. 788, 801 (1992) (APA does not apply toPresident absent express statement by Congress).

While I believe that these last mentioned considerationsare important, they are not determinative. The President,
unlike most agency decisionmakers, is an elected official.He is responsible to the voters, who, in principle, will judge
the manner in which he exercises his delegated authority.
Whether the President's expenditure decisions, for example,
are arbitrary is a matter that in the past has been left primarily to those voters to consider. And this Court has made
clear that judicial review is less appropriate when the President's own discretion, rather than that of an agency, is at
stake. See Dalton v. Specter, 511 U. S. 462, 476 (1994) (Presidential decision on military base closure recommendations
not reviewable; President could "approv[e] or disapprov[e]
the recommendations for whatever reason he sees fit");
Franklin, 505 U. S., at 801 (President's decision whether or
not to transmit census report to Congress was unreviewable
by courts for abuse of discretion); cf. id., at 799-800 (it was
"important to the integrity of the process" that the decision
was made by the President, a "constitutional officer" as opposed to the unelected Secretary of Commerce). These
matters reflect in part the Constitution's own delegation of
"executive Power" to "a President," Art. II, $ 1; cf. Clinton
v. Jones, 520 U. S. 681, 710-711 (1997) (Breyer, J., concurring in judgment) (discussing unitary Executive), and we
must take this into account when applying the Constitution's
nondelegation doctrine to questions of Presidential authority.

Consequently I believe that the power the Act grants the
President to prevent spending items from taking effect does
not violate the "nondelegation" doctrine.

Most, but not all, of the considerations mentioned in the
previous subsection apply to the Act's delegation to the President of the authority to prevent "from having legal force or
effect" a "limited tax benefit," which term the Act defines in
terms of special tax relief for fewer than 100 (or in some
instances 10) beneficiaries, which tax relief is not available
to others who are somewhat similarly situated. 2 U. S. C.

$ 691e(9) (1994 ed., Supp. II). There are, however, two related significant differences between the "limited tax benefit" and the spending items considered above, which make
the "limited tax benefit" question more difficult. First, the
history is different. The history of Presidential authority to
pick and to choose is less voluminous. Second, the subject
matter (increasing or decreasing an individual's taxes) makes
the considerations discussed at the end of the last section
(i. e., the danger of an arbitrary exercise of delegated power)
of greater concern. But these differences, in my view, are
not sufficient to change the "nondelegation" result.

For one thing, this Court has made clear that the standard
we must use to judge whether a law violates the "nondelegation" doctrine is the same in the tax area as in any other.
In Skinner v. Mid-America Pipeline Co., 490 U. S. 212
(1989), the Court considered whether Congress, in the exercise of its taxing power, could delegate to the Secretary of
Transportation the authority to establish a system of pipeline user fees. In rejecting the argument that the "fees"
were actually a "tax," and that the law amounted to an unconstitutional delegation of Congress' own power to tax, the
unanimous Court said that:

"From its earliest days to the present, Congress,
when enacting tax legislation, has varied the degree of
specificity and the consequent degree of discretionary
authority delegated to the Executive . . . .. . . . .

524US2 Unit: $U93 [09-11-00 13:25:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN
492 CLINTON v. CITY OF NEW YORK

Breyer, J., dissenting
"We find no support . . . for [the] contention that thetext of the Constitution or the practices of Congress require the application of a different and stricter nondele-gation doctrine in cases where Congress delegates discretionary authority to the Executive under its taxingpower. . . . Even if the user fees are a form of taxation,
we hold that the delegation of discretionary authorityunder Congress' taxing power is subject to no constitutional scrutiny greater than that we have applied toother nondelegation challenges. Congress may wisely
choose to be more circumspect in delegating authorityunder the Taxing Clause than under other of its enumerated powers, but this is not a heightened degree of pru-dence required by the Constitution." Id., at 221-223.

For another thing, this Court has upheld tax statutes thatdelegate to the President the power to change taxes under
very broad standards. In 1890, for example, Congressauthorized the President to "suspend" the provisions of the
tariff statute, thereby raising tariff rates, if the Presidentdetermined that other nations were imposing "reciprocally
unequal and unreasonable" tariff rates on specialized com-modities. Act of Oct. 1, 1890, ch. 1244, $ 3, 26 Stat. 612.
And the Court upheld the statute against constitutional at-tack.

Field v. Clark, 143 U. S., at 693-694 ("[N]o valid ob-jection can be made" to such statutes "conferring authority

or discretion" on the President) (internal quotation marksomitted); see also Act of Dec. 19, 1806, ch. 1, 2 Stat. 411 (President "authorized" to "suspend the operation of " a customslaw "if in his judgment the public interest should require
it"); Act of June 4, 1794, ch. 41, $ 1, 1 Stat. 372 (empoweringPresident to lay an embargo on ships in ports "whenever, in
his opinion, the public safety shall so require" and to revokerelated regulations "whenever he shall think proper"). In
1922 Congress gave the President the authority to adjusttariff rates to "equalize" the differences in costs of production at home and abroad, see Tariff Act of 1922, ch. 356,

524US2 Unit: $U93 [09-11-00 13:25:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Breyer, J., dissenting

$ 315(a), 42 Stat. 941-942. The Court also upheld this dele-gation against constitutional attack. See

J. W. Hampton,
Jr., & Co. v. United States, 276 U. S. 394 (1928).These statutory delegations resemble today's Act more

closely than one might at first suspect. They involve a duty
on imports, which is a tax. That tax in the last century wasas important then as the income tax is now, for it provided

most of the Federal Government's revenues. See U. S.Dept. of Commerce, Census Bureau, Historical Statistics of
the United States: Colonial Times to 1970, pt. 2, at 1106 (in1890, when Congress passed the statute at issue in

Field,
tariff revenues were 57% of the total receipts of the Federal
Government). And the delegation then thus affected a far
higher percentage of federal revenues than the tax-related
delegation over extremely "limited" tax benefits here. See
supra, at 487.

The standards at issue in these earlier laws, such as "unreasonable," were frequently vague and without precise
meaning. See, e. g., Act of Oct. 1, 1890, $ 3, 26 Stat. 612.
Indeed, the word "equalize" in the 1922 statute, 42 Stat. 942,
could not have been administered as if it offered the precision it seems to promise, for a tariff that literally "equalized"
domestic and foreign production costs would, because of
transport costs, have virtually ended foreign trade.

Nor can I accept the majority's effort to distinguish these
examples. The majority says that these statutes imposed a
specific "duty" upon the President to act upon the occurrence
of a specified event. See ante, at 443. But, in fact, some of
the statutes imposed no duty upon the President at all. See,
e. g., Act of Dec. 19, 1806, ch. 1, 2 Stat. 411 (President "authorized" to "suspend the operation of " a customs law "if in
his judgment the public interest should require it"). Others
imposed a "duty" in terms so vague as to leave substantial
discretion in the President's hands. See Act of Oct. 1, 1890,
26 Stat. 612 (President's "duty" to suspend tariff law was
triggered "whenever" and "so often as" he was "satisfied"

524US2 Unit: $U93 [09-11-00 13:25:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN
494 CLINTON v. CITY OF NEW YORK

Breyer, J., dissenting
that "unequal and unreasonable" rates were imposed); seealso

Field v. Clark, supra, at 691 (historically in the flexible
tariff statutes Congress has "invest[ed] the President withlarge discretion").

The majority also tries to distinguish these examples on
the ground that the President there executed congressionalpolicy while here he rejects that policy. See

ante, at 444.
The President here, however, in exercising his delegatedauthority does not

reject congressional policy. Rather, he
executes a law in which Congress has specified its desirethat the President have the very authority he has exercised.

See Part III, supra.

The majority further points out that these cases concern
imports, an area that, it says, implicates foreign policy and
therefore justifies an unusual degree of discretion by the
President. See ante, at 445. Congress, however, has not
limited its delegations of taxation authority to the "foreign
policy" arena. The first Congress gave the Secretary of the
Treasury the "power to mitigate or remit" statutory penalties for nonpayment of liquor taxes "upon such terms and
conditions as shall appear to him reasonable." Act of Mar.
3, 1791, ch. 15, $ 43, 1 Stat. 209. A few years later, the Secretary was authorized, in lieu of collecting the stamp duty
enacted by Congress, "to agree to an annual composition for
the amount of such stamp duty, with any of the said banks,
of one per centum on the amount of the annual dividend
made by such banks." Act of July 6, 1797, ch. 11, $ 2, 1 Stat.
528. More recently, Congress has given to the Executive
Branch the authority to "prescribe all needful rules and regulations for the enforcement of [the Internal Revenue Code],
including all rules and regulations as may be necessary by
reason of any alteration of law in relation to internal revenue." 26 U. S. C. $ 7805(a). And the Court has held that
such rules and regulations, "which undoubtedly affect individual taxpayer liability, are . . . without doubt the result of
entirely appropriate delegations of discretionary authority

by Congress." Skinner v. Mid-America Pipeline Co., 490U. S., at 222. I do not believe the Court would hold the

same delegations at issue in J. W. Hampton and Field uncon-stitutional were they to arise in a more obviously domestic
area.

Finally, the tax-related delegation is limited in ways thattend to diminish any widespread risk of arbitrary Presidential decisionmaking:(1) The Act does not give the President authority to
change general tax policy. That is because the limited taxbenefits are defined in terms of deviations from tax policy,
i. e., special benefits to fewer than 100 individuals. See 2
U. S. C. $ 691e(9)(A)(i) (1994 ed., Supp. II); see also Analytical
Perpectives 84 (defining "tax expenditure" as "a preferential
exception to the baseline provisions of the tax structure").

(2) The Act requires the President to make the same kind
of policy judgment with respect to these special benefits as
with respect to items of spending. He is to consider the
budget as a whole, he is to consider the particular history of
the tax benefit provision, and he is to consider whether the
provision is worth the loss of revenue it causes in the same
way that he must decide whether a particular expenditure
item is worth the added revenue that it requires. See
supra, at 484-485.

(3) The delegated authority does not destroy any individual's expectation of receiving a particular benefit, for the Act
is written to say to the small group of taxpayers who may
receive the benefit, "Taxpayers, you will receive an exemption from ordinary tax laws, but only if the President decides
the budgetary loss is not too great."

(4) The "limited tax benefit" provisions involve only a
small part of the federal budget, probably less than one percent of total annual outlays and revenues. Compare Budget
303 (federal outlays and receipts in 1997 were both over $1.5
trillion) with App. to Juris. Statement 71a (President's cancellation message for Snake River appellees' limited tax ben524US2 Unit: $U93 [09-11-00 13:25:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN

efit, estimating annual "value" of benefit, in terms of revenueloss, at about $20 million) and Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997,

$ 1701, 111 Stat. 1099 (identifying only 79 "limited tax bene-fits" subject to cancellation in the entire tax statute).

(5) Because the "tax benefit" provisions are part and par-cel of the budget provisions, and because the Act in defining them, focuses upon "revenue-losing" tax provisions, 2U. S. C. $ 691e(9)(A)(i) (1994 ed., Supp. II), it regards "tax
benefits" as if they were a special kind of spending, namelyspending that puts back into the pockets of a small group of
taxpayers, money that "baseline" tax policy would otherwisetake from them. There is, therefore, no need to consider
this provision as if it represented a delegation of authorityto the President, outside the budget expenditure context, to
set major policy under the federal tax laws. But cf. Skinnerv. Mid-America Pipeline, supra, at 222-223 (no "different
and stricter" nondelegation doctrine in the taxation context).Still less does approval of the delegation in this case, given
the long history of Presidential discretion in the budgetarycontext, automatically justify the delegation to the President
of the authority to alter the effect of other laws outsidethat context.

The upshot is that, in my view, the "limited tax benefit"provisions do not differ enough from the "spending" provisions to warrant a different "nondelegation" result.

V
In sum, I recognize that the Act before us is novel. In asense, it skirts a constitutional edge. But that edge has to

do with means, not ends. The means chosen do not amountliterally to the enactment, repeal, or amendment of a law.
Nor, for that matter, do they amount literally to the "lineitem veto" that the Act's title announces. Those means do
not violate any basic separation-of-powers principle. Theydo not improperly shift the constitutionally foreseen balance of power from Congress to the President. Nor, since

they comply with separation-of-powers principles, do theythreaten the liberties of individual citizens. They represent

an experiment that may, or may not, help representativegovernment work better. The Constitution, in my view,
authorizes Congress and the President to try novel methodsin this way. Consequently, with respect, I dissent.

OF SOCIAL SECURITY, et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe first circuit

No. 97-42. Argued March 4, 1998--Decided June 25, 1998
In 1946, a historic labor agreement between coal operators and the United

Mine Workers of America (UMWA) led to the creation of benefit funds
that provided for the medical expenses of miners and their dependents,
with the precise benefits determined by UMWA-appointed trustees.
Those trusts served as the model for the United Mine Workers of
America Welfare and Retirement Fund (1947 W&R Fund), which was
established by the National Bituminous Coal Wage Agreement of 1947
(1947 NBCWA). The Fund used proceeds of a royalty on coal production to provide benefits to miners and their families, and trustees determined benefit levels and other matters. The 1950 NBCWA created a
new fund (1950 W&R Fund), which used a fixed amount of royalties for
benefits, gave trustees the authority to establish and adjust benefit levels so as to remain within the budgetary restraints, and did not guarantee lifetime health benefits for retirees and their dependents. The 1950
W&R Fund continued to operate with benefit levels subject to revision
until the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA)
introduced specific funding and vesting requirements for pension plans.
To comply with ERISA, the UMWA and the Bituminous Coal Operators'
Association entered into the 1974 NBCWA, which created four new
trusts. It was the first agreement to expressly reference health benefits for retirees, but it did not alter the employers' obligation to contribute a fixed amount of royalties. The new agreement did not extend the
employers' liability beyond the term of the agreement. Miners who
retired before 1976 were covered by the 1950 Benefit Plan and Trust
(1950 Benefit Plan), and those retiring after 1975 were covered by the
1974 Benefit Plan and Trust (1974 Benefit Plan). The increase in benefits and other factors--the decline in coal production, the retirement of
a generation of miners, and rapid acceleration in health care costs--
quickly caused financial problems for the 1950 and 1974 Benefit Plans.
To ensure the Plans' solvency, the 1978 NBCWA obligated signatories
to make sufficient contributions to maintain benefits as long as they
were in the coal business. As the Plans continued to suffer financially,
employers began to withdraw, leaving the remaining signatories to absorb the increasing cost of covering retirees left behind.

Ultimately, Congress passed the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit
Act of 1992 (Coal Act) to stabilize funding and provide for benefits to
retirees by merging the 1950 and 1974 Benefit Plans into a new fund
(Combined Fund) that provides substantially the same benefits as provided by the 1950 and 1974 Plans and is funded by premiums assessed
against coal operators that signed any NBCWA or other agreement requiring contributions to the 1950 or 1974 Benefit Plans. Respondent,
Commissioner of Social Security, assigns retirees to signatory coal operators according to the following allocation formula: First, to the most
recent signatory to the 1978 or a subsequent NBCWA to employ the
retiree in the coal industry for at least two years, 26 U. S. C. $ 9706(a)(1);
second, to the most recent signatory to the 1978 or a subsequent
NBCWA to employ the retiree in the coal industry, $ 9706(a)(2); and
third, to the signatory operator that employed the retiree in the coal
industry for the longest period of time prior to the effective date of the
1978 NBCWA, $ 9706(a)(3).

Petitioner Eastern Enterprises (Eastern) was a signatory to every
NBCWA executed between 1947 and 1964. It is "in business" within
the Coal Act's meaning, although it left the coal industry in 1965, after
transferring its coal operations to a subsidiary (EACC) and ultimately
selling its interest in EACC to respondent Peabody Holding Company,
Inc. (Peabody). Under the Coal Act, the Commissioner assigned Eastern the obligation for Combined Fund premiums respecting over 1,000
retired miners who had worked for the company before 1966. Eastern
sued the Commissioner and other respondents, claiming that the Coal
Act violates substantive due process and constitutes a taking in violation of the Fifth Amendment. The District Court granted respondents
summary judgment, and the First Circuit affirmed.

Held: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.
110 F. 3d 150, reversed and remanded.

Justice O'Connor, joined by The Chief Justice, Justice Scalia,
and Justice Thomas, concluded:

1. The declaratory judgment and injunction petitioner seeks are an
appropriate remedy for the taking alleged in this case, and it is within
the district courts' power to award such equitable relief. The Tucker
Act may require that a just compensation claim under the Takings
Clause be filed in the Court of Federal Claims, but petitioner does not
seek compensation from the Government. In situations analogous to
the one here, this Court has assumed the lack of a compensatory remedy
and has granted equitable relief for Takings Clause violations without
discussing the Tucker Act's applicability. See, e. g., Babbitt v. Youpee,
519 U. S. 234, 234-235. Pp. 519-522.

2. The Coal Act's allocation of liability to Eastern violates the Takings
Clause. Pp. 522-537.

(a) Economic regulation such as the Coal Act may effect a taking.
United States v. Security Industrial Bank, 459 U. S. 70, 78. The party
challenging the government action bears a substantial burden, for not
every destruction or injury to property by such action is a constitutional
taking. A regulation's constitutionality is evaluated by examining the
governmental action's "justice and fairness." See Andrus v. Allard,
444 U. S. 51, 65. Although that inquiry does not lend itself to any set
formula, three factors traditionally have informed this Court's regulatory takings analysis: "[T]he economic impact of the regulation, its
interference with reasonable investment backed expectations, and the
character of the governmental action." Kaiser Aetna v. United States,
444 U. S. 164, 175. Pp. 522-524.

(b) The analysis in this case is informed by previous decisions considering the constitutionality of somewhat similar legislative schemes:
Usery v. Turner Elkhorn Mining Co., 428 U. S. 1 (Black Lung Benefits
Act of 1972); Connolly v. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, 475
U. S. 211 (Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980); and
Concrete Pipe & Products of Cal., Inc. v. Construction Laborers Pension Trust for Southern Cal., 508 U. S. 602 (same). Those opinions
make clear that Congress has considerable leeway to fashion economic
legislation, including the power to affect contractual commitments between private parties; and that it may impose retroactive liability to
some degree, particularly where it is " `confined to short and limited
periods required by the practicalities of producing national legislation,' "
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation v. R. A. Gray & Co., 467 U. S.
717, 731. The decisions, however, have left open the possibility that
legislation might be unconstitutional if it imposes severe retroactive liability on a limited class of parties that could not have anticipated the
liability, and if the extent of that liability is substantially disproportionate to the parties' experience. Pp. 524-529.

(c) The Coal Act's allocation scheme, as applied to Eastern, presents such a case, when the three traditional factors are considered. As
to the economic impact, Eastern's Coal Act liability is substantial, and
the company is clearly deprived of the $50 to $100 million it must pay
to the Combined Fund. An employer's statutory liability for multiemployer plan benefits should reflect some proportionality to its experience
with the plan. Concrete Pipe, supra, at 645. Eastern contributed to
the 1947 and 1950 W&R Funds, but ceased its coal mining operations in
1965 and neither participated in negotiations nor agreed to make contributions in connection with the Benefit Plans established under the 1974,
1978, or subsequent NBCWA's. It is the latter agreements, however,
that first suggest an industry commitment to funding lifetime health

Syllabus
benefits for retirees and their dependents. During the years that Eastern employed miners, such benefits were far less extensive than under
the 1974 NBCWA, were unvested, and were fully subject to alteration
or termination. To the extent that Eastern may be able to seek indemnification from EACC or Peabody under contractual arrangements that
might insure Eastern against liabilities arising out of its former coal
operations, that indemnity is neither enhanced nor supplanted by the
Coal Act and does not affect the availability of the declaratory relief
sought here. Respondents' argument that the Coal Act moderates and
mitigates the economic impact by allocating some of Eastern's former
employees to signatories of the 1978 NBCWA is unavailing. That Eastern is not forced to bear the burden of lifetime benefits for all of its
former employees does not mean that its liability is not a significant
economic burden.

For similar reasons, the Coal Act substantially interferes with Eastern's reasonable investment-backed expectations. It operates retroactively, reaching back 30 to 50 years to impose liability based on Eastern's
activities between 1946 and 1965. Retroactive legislation is generally
disfavored. It presents problems of unfairness because it can deprive
citizens of legitimate expectations and upset settled transactions. General Motors Corp. v. Romein, 503 U. S. 181, 191. The distance into the
past that the Coal Act reaches back to impose liability on Eastern and
the magnitude of that liability raise substantial fairness questions. The
pre-1974 NBCWA's do not demonstrate that there was an implicit industrywide agreement to fund lifetime health benefits at the time that
Eastern was involved in the coal industry. The 1947 and 1950 W&R
Funds, in which Eastern participated, operated on a pay-as-you-go basis
and the classes of beneficiaries were subject to the trustees' discretion.
Not until 1974, when ERISA forced revisions to the 1950 W&R Fund
and when Eastern was no longer in the industry, could lifetime medical
benefits have been viewed as promised. Thus, the Coal Act's scheme
for allocating Combined Fund premiums is not calibrated either to Eastern's past actions or to any agreement by the company. Nor would the
Federal Government's pattern of involvement in the coal industry have
given Eastern sufficient notice that lifetime health benefits might be
guaranteed to retirees several decades later. Eastern's liability for
such benefits also differs from coal operators' responsibility under the
Black Lung Benefits Act of 1972, which spread the cost of employmentrelated disabilities to those who profited from the fruits of the employees' labor, Turner Elkhorn, supra, at 18. Finally, the nature of the
governmental action in this case is quite unusual in that Congress' solution to the grave funding problem that it identified singles out certain
employers to bear a substantial burden, based on the employers' conduct

Syllabus
far in the past, and unrelated to any commitment that the employers
made or to any injury they caused. Pp. 529-537.

Justice Kennedy concluded that application of the Coal Act to Eastern would violate the proper bounds of settled due process principles.
Although the Court has been hesitant to subject economic legislation to
due process scrutiny as a general matter, this country's law has harbored a singular distrust of retroactive statutes, and that distrust is
reflected in this Court's due process jurisprudence. For example, in
Usery v. Turner Elkhorn Mining Co., 428 U. S. 1, 15, the Court held
that due process requires an inquiry into whether a legislature acted in
an arbitrary and irrational way when enacting a retroactive law. This
formulation has been repeated in numerous recent cases, e. g., United
States v. Carlton, 512 U. S. 26, 31, which reflect the recognition that
retroactive lawmaking is a particular concern because of the legislative
temptation to use it as a means of retribution against unpopular groups
or individuals, Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U. S. 244, 266. Because change in the legal consequences of transactions long closed can
destroy the reasonable certainty and security which are the very objects
of property ownership, due process protection for property must be understood to incorporate the settled tradition against retroactive laws of
great severity. The instant case presents one of those rare instances
where the legislature has exceeded the limits imposed by due process.
The Coal Act's remedy bears no legitimate relation to the interest which
the Government asserts supports the statute. The degree of retroactive effect, which is a significant determinant in a statute's constitutionality, e. g., United States v. Carlton, supra, at 32, is of unprecedented
scope here, since the Coal Act created liability for events occurring 35
years ago. While the Court has upheld the imposition of liability on
former employers based on past employment relationships when the remedial statutes were designed to impose an actual, measurable business
cost which the employer had been able to avoid in the past, e. g., Turner
Elkhorn, supra, at 19, the Coal Act does not serve this purpose. The
beneficiaries' expectation of lifetime benefits was created by promises
and agreements made long after Eastern left the coal business, and
Eastern was not responsible for the perilous condition of the 1950 and
1974 Plans which jeopardized the benefits. Pp. 547-550.

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 1992 (Coal Act orAct), 26 U. S. C. $$ 9701-9722 (1994 ed. and Supp. II), which

establishes a mechanism for funding health care benefits forretirees from the coal industry and their dependents. We
conclude that the Coal Act, as applied to petitioner EasternEnterprises, effects an unconstitutional taking.

I
A

For a good part of this century, employers in the coal in-dustry have been involved in negotiations with the United

Mine Workers of America (UMWA or Union) regarding theprovision of employee benefits to coal miners. When petitioner Eastern Enterprises (Eastern) was formed in 1929,coal operators provided health care to their employees
through a prepayment system funded by payroll deductions.Because of the rural location of most mines, medical facilities
were frequently substandard, and many of the medical pro-fessionals willing to work in mining areas were "company
doctors," often selected by the coal operators for reasonsother than their skills or training. The health care available
to coal miners and their families was deficient in many re-spects. In addition, the cost of company-provided services,
such as housing and medical care, often consumed the bulk ofminers' compensation. See generally U. S. Dept. of Interior,
Report of the Coal Mines Administration, A Medical Surveyof the Bituminous-Coal Industry (1947) (Boone Report); Report of United States Coal Commission, S. Doc. No. 195, 68thCong., 2d Sess. (1925).

In the late 1930's, the UMWA began to demand changesin the manner in which essential services were provided to
miners, and by 1946, the subject of miners' health care hadbecome a critical issue in collective bargaining negotiations
between the Union and bituminous coal companies. Whena breakdown in those negotiations resulted in a nationwide

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
strike, President Truman issued an Executive order directing Secretary of the Interior Julius Krug to take possession of all bituminous coal mines and to negotiate "appropriate changes in the terms and conditions of employment"
of miners with the UMWA. 11 Fed. Reg. 5593 (1946). A
week of negotiations between Secretary Krug and UMWA
President John L. Lewis produced the historic Krug-Lewis
Agreement that ended the strike. See App. in No. 96-1947
(CA1), p. 610 (hereinafter App. (CA1)).

That agreement, described as "an almost complete victory
for the miners," M. Fox, United We Stand 405 (1990), led
to the creation of benefit funds, financed by royalties on
coal produced and payroll deductions. The funds compensated miners and their dependents and survivors for wages
lost due to disability, death, or retirement. The funds also
provided for the medical expenses of miners and their
dependents, with the precise benefits determined by
UMWA-appointed trustees. In addition, the Krug-Lewis
Agreement committed the Government to undertake a comprehensive survey of the living conditions in coal mining
areas in order to assess the improvements necessary to bring
those communities up to "recognized American standards."
Krug-Lewis Agreement $ 5, App. (CA1) 613. That study
concluded that the medical needs of miners and their dependents would be more effectively served through "a broad
prepayment system, based on sound actuarial principles."
Boone Report 226-227.

Shortly after the study was issued, the mines returned to
private control and the UMWA and several coal operators
entered into the National Bituminous Coal Wage Agreement
of 1947 (1947 NBCWA), App. (CA1) 615, which established
the United Mine Workers of America Welfare and Retirement Fund (1947 W&R Fund), modeled after the KrugLewis benefit trusts. The Fund was to use the proceeds of
a royalty on coal production to provide pension and medical

benefits to miners and their families. The 1947 NBCWA didnot specify the benefits to which miners and their dependents were entitled. Instead, three trustees appointed bythe parties were given authority to determine "coverage and
eligibility, priorities among classes of benefits, amounts ofbenefits, methods of providing or arranging for provisions
for benefits, investment of trust funds, and all other relatedmatters." 1947 NBCWA 146, App. (CA1) 619.

Disagreement over benefits continued, however, leadingto the execution of another NBCWA in 1950, which created
a new multiemployer trust, the United Mine Workers ofAmerica Welfare and Retirement Fund of 1950 (1950 W&R
Fund). The 1950 W&R Fund established a 30-cents-per-tonroyalty on coal produced, payable by signatory operators on
a "several and not joint" basis for the duration of the 1950Agreement. 1950 NBCWA 63, App. (CA1) 640. As with
the 1947 W&R Fund, the 1950 W&R Fund was governed bythree trustees chosen by the parties and vested with responsibility to determine the level of benefits. Id., at 59-61,App. (CA1) 638-639. Between 1950 and 1974, the 1950
NBCWA was amended on occasion, and new NBCWA's wereadopted in 1968 and 1971. Except for increases in the
amount of royalty payments, however, the terms and struc-ture of the 1950 W&R Fund remained essentially unchanged.
A 1951 amendment recognized the creation of the Bitumi-nous Coal Operators' Association (BCOA), a multiemployer
bargaining association, which became the primary repre-sentative of coal operators in negotiations with the Union.
See App. (CA1) 647-648.Under the 1950 W&R Fund, miners and their dependents
were not promised specific benefits. As the 1950 W&RFund's Annual Report for the fiscal year ending June 30,
1955, explained:

"Under the legal and financial obligations . . . imposed[by the Trust Agreement], the Fund is operated on

a pay-as-you-go basis, maintaining a sound relation524US2 Unit: $U94 [09-11-00 13:26:39] PAGES PGT: OPLG

ship between revenues and expenditures. Resolutionsadopted by the Trustees governing Fund Benefits--Pensions, Hospital and Medical Care, and Widows and Sur-vivors Benefits--specifically provide that all these Benefits are subject to termination, revision, or amendment,by the Trustees in their discretion at any time. No
vested interest in the Fund extends to any beneficiary."
Id., at 3-4, App. (CA1) 869-870.

See also Mine Workers Health and Retirement Funds v.
Robinson, 455 U. S. 562, 565, and n. 2 (1982). Thus, theFund operated using a fixed amount of royalties, with the

trustees having the authority to establish and adjust thelevel of benefits provided so as to remain within the budgetary constraints.Subsequent annual reports of the 1950 W&R Fund reiterated that benefits were subject to change. See, e. g., 1950W&R Fund Annual Report for the Year Ending June 30,
1956 (1956 Annual Report), p. 30, App. (CA1) 929 ("Resolu-tions adopted by the Trustees governing Fund Benefits--

persons involved in the coal industry may have made occa-sional statements intimating that the 1950 W&R Fund promised lifetime health benefits, see App. (CA1) 1899, 1971-1972,it is clear that the 1950 W&R Fund did not, by its terms,
guarantee lifetime health benefits for retirees and their de-pendents. In fact, as to widows of miners, the 1950 W&R
Fund expressly limited health benefits to the time periodduring which widows would also receive death benefits.
See, e. g., Robinson, supra, at 565-566; 1956 Annual Report14, App. (CA1) 913.

Between 1950 and 1974, the trustees often exercised their
prerogative to alter the level of benefits according to the
Fund's budget. In 1960, for instance, "[t]he Trustees of theFund, recognizing their legal and fiscal obligation to soundly

administer the Trust Fund, took action prior to the closeof the fiscal year, to curtail the excess of expenditures over
income," by "limit[ing] or terminat[ing] eligibility for [cer-tain] Trust Fund Benefits." 1960 Annual Report 2, App.
(CA1) 1011. Similar concerns prompted the trustees to re-duce monthly pension benefits by 25% at one point, and to
limit the range of medical and pension benefits available to
miners employed by operators who did not pay the requiredroyalties. See 1961 Annual Report 2, 11-12, App. (CA1)

1044, 1053-1054; 1963 Annual Report 13, 16, App. (CA1)1121, 1124.

Reductions in benefits were not always acceptable to theminers, and some wildcat strikes erupted in the 1960's. See
Secretary of Labor's Advisory Commission on United MineWorkers of America Retiree Health Benefits, Coal Commission Report 22-23 (1990) (Coal Comm'n Report), App. (CA1)

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
1352-1353. Nonetheless, the 1950 W&R Fund continued toprovide benefits on a "pay-as-you-go" basis, with the level of

benefits fully subject to revision, until the Employee Retire-ment Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 29 U. S. C.

$ 1001 et seq., introduced specific funding and vesting requirements for pension plans. To comply with ERISA, theUMWA and the BCOA entered into a new agreement, the

1974 NBCWA, which created four trusts, funded by royaltieson coal production and premiums based on hours worked by
miners, to replace the 1950 W&R Fund. See Robinson,
supra, at 566. Two of the new trusts, the UMWA 1950 Benefit Plan and Trust (1950 Benefit Plan) and the UMWA 1974
Benefit Plan and Trust (1974 Benefit Plan), provided nonpension benefits, including medical benefits. Miners who retired before January 1, 1976, and their dependents were covered by the 1950 Benefit Plan, while active miners and those
who retired after 1975 were covered by the 1974 Benefit
Plan.

The 1974 NBCWA thus was the first agreement between
the UMWA and the BCOA to expressly reference health
benefits for retirees; prior agreements did not specifically
mention retirees, and the scope of their benefits was left to
the discretion of fund trustees. The 1974 NBCWA explained that it was amending previous medical benefits to
provide a Health Services card for retired miners until their
death, and to their widows until their death or remarriage.
1974 NBCWA 99, 105 (Summary of Principal Provisions,
UMWA Health and Retirement Benefits), App. (CA1) 755,

not alter the employers' obligation to contribute only a fixed
amount of royalties, nor did it extend employers' liability beyond the life of the agreement. See id., Art. XX, $ (d), App.
(CA1) 749.

As a result of the broadened coverage under the 1974
NBCWA, the number of eligible benefit recipients jumped
dramatically. See 1977 Annual Report of the UMWA Wel524US2 Unit: $U94 [09-11-00 13:26:39] PAGES PGT: OPLG

The increase in benefits, combined with various othercircumstances--such as a decline in the amount of coal

produced, the retirement of a generation of miners, and rapid
escalation of health care costs--quickly resulted in financialproblems for the 1950 and 1974 Benefit Plans. In response,

the next NBCWA, executed in 1978, assigned responsibilityto signatory employers for the health care of their own active
and retired employees. See 1978 NBCWA, Art. XX, $ (c)(3),
App. (CA1) 778. The 1974 Benefit Plan remained in effect,
but only to cover retirees whose former employers were no
longer in business.

To ensure the Benefit Plans' solvency, the 1978 NBCWA
included a "guarantee" clause obligating signatories to make
sufficient contributions to maintain benefits during that
agreement, and "evergreen" clauses were incorporated into
the Benefit Plans so that signatories would be required to
contribute as long as they remained in the coal business, regardless of whether they signed a subsequent agreement.
See id., $ (h), App. (CA1) 787-788; House Report 5. As a
result, the coal operators' liability to the Benefit Plans
shifted from a defined contribution obligation, under which
employers were responsible only for a predetermined

amount of royalties, to a form of defined benefit obligation,under which employers were to fund specific benefits.

Despite the 1978 changes, the Benefit Plans continued tosuffer financially as costs increased and employers who had
signed the 1978 NBCWA withdrew from the agreement,either to continue in business with nonunion employees or to
exit the coal business altogether. As more and more coaloperators abandoned the Benefit Plans, the remaining signatories were forced to absorb the increasing cost of coveringretirees left behind by exiting employers. A spiral soon developed, with the rising cost of participation leading moreemployers to withdraw from the Benefit Plans, resulting in
more onerous obligations for those that remained. In 1988,the UMWA and BCOA attempted to relieve the situation by
imposing withdrawal liability on NBCWA signatories whoseceded from the Benefit Plans. See 1988 NBCWA, Art.
XX, $$ (i) and ( j), App. (CA1) 805, 828-829. Even so, by1990, the 1950 and 1974 Benefit Plans had incurred a deficit
of about $110 million, and obligations to beneficiaries werecontinuing to surpass revenues. See House Report 9; Coal
Comm'n Report 43-44, App. (CA1) 1373-1374.

In response to unrest among miners, such as the lengthystrike that followed Pittston Coal Company's refusal to sign

the 1988 NBCWA, Secretary of Labor Elizabeth Dole an-nounced the creation of the Advisory Commission on United
Mine Workers of America Retiree Health Benefits (CoalCommission or Commission). The Coal Commission was
charged with "recommend[ing] a solution for ensuring thatorphan retirees in the 1950 and 1974 Benefit Trusts will continue to receive promised medical care." Coal Comm'n Report 2, App. (CA1) 1333. The Commission explained that"[h]ealth care benefits are an emotional subject in the coal

industry, not only because coal miners have been promised

and guaranteed health care benefits for life, but also becausecoal miners in their labor contracts have traded lower pensions over the years for better health care benefits." CoalComm'n Report, Executive Summary vii, App. (CA1) 1324.
The Commission agreed that "a statutory obligation to contribute to the plans should be imposed on current and formersignatories to the [NBCWA]," but disagreed about "whether

the entire [coal] industry should contribute to the resolutionof the problem of orphan retirees."

Id., at vii-viii, App.
(CA1) 1324-1325. Therefore, the Commission proposed twoalternative funding plans for Congress' consideration.

First, the Commission recommended that Congress establish a fund financed by an industrywide fee to provide health
care to orphan retirees at the level of benefits they were
entitled to receive at that fund's inception. To cover the
cost of medical benefits for retirees from signatories to the
1978 or subsequent NBCWA's who remained in the coal business, the Commission proposed the creation of another fund
financed by the retirees' most recent employers. Id., at 61,
App. (CA1) 1390. The Commission also recommended that
Congress codify the "evergreen" obligation of the 1978 and
subsequent NBCWA's. Id., at 63, App. (CA1) 1392.

As an alternative to imposing industrywide liability, the
Commission suggested that Congress spread the cost of retirees' health benefits across "a broadened base of current
and past signatories to the contracts," apparently referring
to the 1978 and subsequent NBCWA's. See id., at 58, 65,
App. (CA1) 1387, 1394. Not all Commission members
agreed, however, that it would be fair to assign such a burden to signatories of the 1978 agreement. Four Commissioners explained that "[i]ssues of elemental fairness are involved" in imposing obligations on "respectable operators
who made decisions in the past to move to different locales,
invest in different technology, or pursue their business with
or without respect to union presence." Id., at 85, App.
(CA1) 1414 (statement of Commissioners Michael J. Mahoney,

id., at 81-82, App. (CA1) 1410-1411 (statement of Commissioner Richard M. Holsten).

After the Coal Commission issued its report, Congress
considered several proposals to fund health benefits for
UMWA retirees. At a 1991 hearing, a Senate subcommittee
was advised that more than 120,000 retirees might not receive "the benefits they were promised." Coal Commission
Report on Health Benefits of Retired Coal Miners: Hearing
before the Subcommittee on Medicare and Long-Term Care
of the Senate Committee on Finance, 102d Cong., 1st Sess.,
45 (1991) (statement of BCOA Chairman Michael K. Reilly).
The Coal Commission's Chairman submitted a statement
urging that Congress' assistance was needed "to fulfill the
promises that began in the collective bargaining process
nearly 50 years ago . . . ." Id., at 306 (prepared statement
of W. J. Usery, Jr.). Some Senators expressed similar concerns that retired miners might not receive the benefits
promised to them. See id., at 16 (statement of Sen. Dave
Durenberger) (describing issue as involving "a whole bunch
of promises made to a whole lot of people back in the 1940s
and 1950s when the cost consequences of those problems
were totally unknown"); id., at 59 (prepared statement of
Sen. Orrin G. Hatch) (stating that "miners and their families
. . . were led to believe by their own union leaders and the
companies for which they worked that they were guaranteed
lifetime [health] benefits").

In 1992, as part of a larger bill, both Houses passed legislation based on the Coal Commission's first proposal, which
required signatories to the 1978 or any subsequent NBCWA
to fund their own retirees' health care costs and provided for
orphan retirees' benefits through a tax on future coal production. See H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 102-461, pp. 268-295 (1992).
President Bush, however, vetoed the entire bill. See H. R.
Doc. No. 102-206, p. 1 (1992).

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
Congress responded by passing the Coal Act, a modifiedversion of the Coal Commission's alternative funding plan.

In the Act, Congress purported "to identify persons mostresponsible for [1950 and 1974 Benefit Plan] liabilities in
order to stabilize plan funding and allow for the provision ofhealth care benefits to . . . retirees." $ 19142(a)(2), 106 Stat.
3037, note following 26 U. S. C. $ 9701; see also 138 Cong. Rec.34001 (1992) (Conference Report on Coal Act) (explaining
that, under the Coal Act, "those companies which employedthe retirees in question, and thereby benefitted from their
services, will be assigned responsibility for providing thehealth care benefits promised in their various collective bargaining agreements").The Coal Act merged the 1950 and 1974 Benefit Plans into
a new multiemployer plan called the United Mine Workersof America Combined Benefit Fund (Combined Fund). See
26 U. S. C. $$ 9702(a)(1), (2).2 The Combined Fund provides"substantially the same" health benefits to retirees and their
dependents that they were receiving under the 1950 and1974 Benefit Plans. See $$ 9703(b)(1), (f). It is financed by
annual premiums assessed against "signatory coal opera-tors," i. e., coal operators that signed any NBCWA or any
other agreement requiring contributions to the 1950 or 1974Benefit Plans. See $$ 9701(b)(1), (3); $ 9701(c)(1). Any signatory operator who "conducts or derives revenue from anybusiness activity, whether or not in the coal industry," may
be liable for those premiums. $$ 9706(a), 9701(c)(7). Wherea signatory is no longer involved in any business activity,
premiums may be levied against "related person[s]," includ-ing successors in interest and businesses or corporations
under common control. $$ 9706(a), 9701(c)(2)(A).The Commissioner of Social Security (Commissioner) calculates the premiums due from any signatory operator based

2 The Coal Act also established another fund, the 1992 UMWA Benefit
Plan, which is not at issue here. See 26 U. S. C. $ 9712.

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
on the following formula, by which retirees are assigned to
particular operators:

"For purposes of this chapter, the Commissioner of
Social Security shall . . . assign each coal industry retiree
who is an eligible beneficiary to a signatory operator
which (or any related person with respect to which) remains in business in the following order:

"(1) First, to the signatory operator which--
"(A) was a signatory to the 1978 coal wage agreement
or any subsequent coal wage agreement, and

"(B) was the most recent signatory operator to employ the coal industry retiree in the coal industry for at
least 2 years.

"(2) Second, if the retiree is not assigned under paragraph (1), to the signatory operator which--

"(A) was a signatory to the 1978 coal wage agreement
or any subsequent coal wage agreement, and

"(B) was the most recent signatory operator to employ the coal industry retiree in the coal industry.

"(3) Third, if the retiree is not assigned under paragraph (1) or (2), to the signatory operator which employed the coal industry retiree in the coal industry for
a longer period of time than any other signatory operator prior to the effective date of the 1978 coal wage
agreement." $ 9706(a).

It is the application of the third prong of the allocation formula, $ 9706(a)(3), to Eastern that we review in this case.3

3 The Coal Act also provides for an allocation of liability for unassigned
beneficiaries. See 26 U. S. C. $ 9704(d). That liability, however, has thus
far been covered through the transfer of funds from other sources. See

$ 9705; 30 U. S. C. $ 1232(h). This case presents no question regarding the
assignment to Eastern of liability for any retirees other than its own
former employees.

Opinion of O'Connor, J.

A

Eastern was organized as a Massachusetts business trust
in 1929, under the name Eastern Gas and Fuel Associates.
Its current holdings include Boston Gas Company and a
barge operator. Therefore, although Eastern is no longer
involved in the coal industry, it is "in business" within the
meaning of the Coal Act. Until 1965, Eastern conducted extensive coal mining operations centered in West Virginia and
Pennsylvania. As a signatory to each NBCWA executed between 1947 and 1964, Eastern made contributions of over $60
million to the 1947 and 1950 W&R Funds. Brief for Petitioner 6.

In 1963, Eastern decided to transfer its coal-related operations to a subsidiary, Eastern Associated Coal Corp. (EACC).
The transfer was completed by the end of 1965, and was described in Eastern's federal income tax return as an agreement by EACC to assume all of Eastern's liabilities arising
out of coal mining and marketing operations in exchange for
Eastern's receipt of EACC's stock. EACC made similar
representations in Security and Exchange Commission filings, describing itself as the successor to Eastern's coal
business. See App. (CA1) 117-118. At that time, the 1950
W&R Fund had a positive balance of over $145 million.
1966 Annual Report 3, App. (CA1) 1207.

Eastern retained its stock interest in EACC through a
subsidiary corporation, Coal Properties Corp. (CPC), until
1987, and it received dividends of more than $100 million
from EACC during that period. See Brief for Petitioner 6,
n. 13. In 1987, Eastern sold its interest in CPC to respondent Peabody Holding Company, Inc. (Peabody). Under the
terms of the agreement effecting the transfer, Peabody, CPC,
and EACC assumed responsibility for payments to certain
benefit plans, including the "Benefit Plan for UMWA Represented Employees of EACC and Subs." App. 206a, 210a.

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
As of June 30, 1987, the 1950 and 1974 Benefit Plans reportedsurplus assets, totaling over $33 million. House Report 9.

B
Following enactment of the Coal Act, the Commissionerassigned to Eastern the obligation for Combined Fund premiums respecting over 1,000 retired miners who had workedfor the company before 1966, based on Eastern's status
as the pre-1978 signatory operator for whom the minershad worked for the longest period of time. See 26 U. S. C.

$ 9706(a). Eastern's premium for a 12-month period ex-ceeded $5 million. See Brief for Petitioner 16.

Eastern responded by suing the Commissioner, as well asthe Combined Fund and its trustees, in the United States
District Court for the District of Massachusetts. Easternasserted that the Coal Act, either on its face or as applied,
violates substantive due process and constitutes a taking ofits property in violation of the Fifth Amendment. Eastern
also challenged the Commissioner's interpretation of theCoal Act. The District Court granted summary judgment
for respondents on all claims, upholding both the Commis-sioner's interpretation of the Coal Act and the Act's constitutionality. Eastern Enterprises v. Shalala, 942 F. Supp. 684(Mass. 1996).

The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed.
Eastern Enterprises v. Chater, 110 F. 3d 150 (1997). Thecourt rejected Eastern's challenge to the Commissioner's interpretation of the Coal Act. Addressing Eastern's substan-tive due process claim, the court described the Coal Act as
"entitled to the most deferential level of judicial scrutiny,"explaining that, "[w]here, as here, a piece of legislation is
purely economic and does not abridge fundamental rights, achallenger must show that the legislature acted in an arbitrary and irrational way." Id., at 155-156 (internal quota-tion marks omitted). In the court's view, the retroactive liability imposed by the Act was permissible "[a]s long as the

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
retroactive application . . . is supported by a legitimate legis-lative purpose furthered by rational means," for "judgments

about the wisdom of such legislation remain within the ex-clusive province of the legislative and executive branches."
Id., at 156 (internal quotation marks omitted). The court
concluded that Congress' purpose in enacting the Coal Actwas legitimate and that Eastern's obligations under the Act

are rationally related to those objectives, because Eastern'sexecution of pre-1974 NBCWA's contributed to miners' expectations of lifetime health benefits. Id., at 157. Thecourt rejected Eastern's argument that costs of retiree
health benefits should be borne by post-1974 coal operators,
reasoning that Eastern's proposal would require coal operators to fund health benefits for miners whom the operators
had never employed. Id., at 158, n. 5. The court also noted
the substantial dividends that Eastern had received from
EACC. Id., at 158.

The court analyzed Eastern's claim that the Coal Act effects an uncompensated taking under the three factors set
out in Connolly v. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation,
475 U. S. 211, 225 (1986): "(1) the economic impact of the regulation on the claimant, (2) the extent to which the regulation interferes with the claimant's reasonable investmentbacked expectations, and (3) the nature of the governmental
action." 110 F. 3d, at 160. With respect to the Act's economic impact on Eastern, the court observed that the Act
"does not involve the total deprivation of an asset." Ibid.
The Act's terms, the court found, "reflec[t] a sufficient degree
of proportionality" because Eastern is assigned liability only
for miners "whom it employed for a relevant (and relatively
long) period of time," and then only if no post-1977 NBCWA
signatory (or related person) can be found. Ibid. The
court also rejected Eastern's contention that the Act unreasonably interferes with its investment-backed expectations,
explaining that the pattern of federal intervention in the coal
industry and Eastern's role in fostering an expectation of

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
lifetime health benefits meant that Eastern "had every reason to anticipate that it might be called upon to bear some
of the financial burden that this expectation engendered."
Id., at 161. Finally, in assessing the nature of the challenged governmental action, the court determined that the
Coal Act does not result in the physical invasion or permanent appropriation of Eastern's property, but merely "adjusts the benefits and burdens of economic life to promote
the common good." Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). The court also noted that the premiums are disbursed
to the privately operated Combined Fund, not to a government entity. For those reasons, the court concluded, "there
is no basis whatever for [Eastern's] claim that the [Coal Act]
transgresses the Takings Clause." Ibid.

Other Courts of Appeals have also upheld the Coal Act
against constitutional challenges.4 In view of the importance of the issues raised in this case, we granted certiorari.

We begin with a threshold jurisdictional question, raised
in the federal respondent's answer to Eastern's complaint:
Whether petitioner's takings claim was properly filed in Federal District Court rather than the United States Court of
Federal Claims. See App. (CA1) 40. Although the Commissioner no longer challenges the Court's adjudication of
this action, see Brief for Federal Respondent 38-39, n. 30, it
is appropriate that we clarify the basis of our jurisdiction
over petitioner's claims.

520 EASTERN ENTERPRISES v. APFEL

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
Under the Tucker Act, 28 U. S. C. $ 1491(a)(1), the Court of
Federal Claims has exclusive jurisdiction to render judgment
upon any claim against the United States for money damages
exceeding $10,000 that is "founded either upon the Constitution, or any Act of Congress or any regulation of an executive department, or upon any express or implied contract
with the United States, or for liquidated or unliquidated
damages in cases not sounding in tort." Accordingly, a
claim for just compensation under the Takings Clause must
be brought to the Court of Federal Claims in the first instance, unless Congress has withdrawn the Tucker Act grant
of jurisdiction in the relevant statute. See, e. g., Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., 467 U. S. 986, 1016-1019 (1984).

In this case, however, Eastern does not seek compensation
from the Government. Instead, Eastern requests a declaratory judgment that the Coal Act violates the Constitution
and a corresponding injunction against the Commissioner's
enforcement of the Act as to Eastern. Such equitable relief
is arguably not within the jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act. See United States v.
Mitchell, 463 U. S. 206, 216 (1983) (explaining that, in order
for a claim to be "cognizable under the Tucker Act," it "must
be one for money damages against the United States"); see
also, e. g., Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487 U. S. 879, 905 (1988).

Some Courts of Appeals have accepted the view that the
Tucker Act does not apply to suits seeking only equitable
relief, see In re Chateaugay Corp., 53 F. 3d 478, 493 (CA2),
cert. denied sub nom. LTV Steel Co. v. Shalala, 516 U. S. 913

(1995); Southeast Kansas Community Action Program, Inc.
v. Secretary of Agriculture, 967 F. 2d 1452, 1455-1456 (CA10
1992), while others have concluded that a claim for equitable
relief under the Takings Clause is hypothetical, and therefore not within the district courts' jurisdiction, until compensation has been sought and refused in the Court of Federal
Claims, see Bay View, Inc. v. Ahtna, Inc., 105 F. 3d 1281,

524US2 Unit: $U94 [09-11-00 13:26:39] PAGES PGT: OPLG

1286 (CA9 1997); Rose Acre Farms, Inc. v. Madigan, 956F. 2d 670, 673-674 (CA7), cert. denied, 506 U. S. 820 (1992).

On the one hand, this Court's precedent can be read tosupport the latter conclusion that regardless of the nature of
relief sought, the availability of a Tucker Act remedy renders
premature any takings claim in federal district court. See
Preseault v. ICC, 494 U. S. 1, 11 (1990); see also Monsanto,
supra, at 1016. On the other hand, in a case such as thisone, it cannot be said that monetary relief against the Government is an available remedy. See Brief for Federal Re-spondent 38-39, n. 30. The payments mandated by the Coal
Act, although calculated by a Government agency, are paid
to the privately operated Combined Fund. Congress could
not have contemplated that the Treasury would compensate
coal operators for their liability under the Act, for "[e]very
dollar paid pursuant to a statute would be presumed to generate a dollar of Tucker Act compensation." In re Chateaugay Corp., 53 F. 3d, at 493. Accordingly, the "presumption
of Tucker Act availability must be reversed where the challenged statute, rather than burdening real or physical property, requires a direct transfer of funds" mandated by the
Government. Ibid. In that situation, a claim for compensation "would entail an utterly pointless set of activities."
Student Loan Marketing Assn. v. Riley, 104 F. 3d 397, 401
(CADC), cert. denied, 522 U. S. 913 (1997). Instead, as we
explained in Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Environmental
Study Group, Inc., 438 U. S. 59, 71, n. 15 (1978), the Declaratory Judgment Act "allows individuals threatened with a
taking to seek a declaration of the constitutionality of the
disputed governmental action before potentially uncompensable damages are sustained."

Moreover, in situations analogous to this case, we have
assumed the lack of a compensatory remedy and have
granted equitable relief for Takings Clause violations without discussing the applicability of the Tucker Act. See, e. g.,
Babbitt v. Youpee, 519 U. S. 234, 243-245 (1997); Hodel v. Ir524US2 Unit: $U94 [09-11-00 13:26:39] PAGES PGT: OPLG

ving, 481 U. S. 704, 716-718 (1987). Without addressing thebasis of this Court's jurisdiction, we have also upheld similar

statutory schemes against Takings Clause challenges. SeeConcrete Pipe & Products of Cal., Inc. v. Construction Laborers Pension Trust for Southern Cal., 508 U. S. 602, 641-647 (1993);

Connolly, 475 U. S., at 221-228. "While we arenot bound by previous exercises of jurisdiction in cases in

which our power to act was not questioned but was passedsub silentio, neither should we disregard the implications of
an exercise of judicial authority assumed to be proper" inprevious cases. Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, 370 U. S.
294, 307 (1962) (citations omitted). Based on the nature ofthe taking alleged in this case, we conclude that the declaratory judgment and injunction sought by petitioner constitutean appropriate remedy under the circumstances, and that it
is within the district courts' power to award such equitablerelief.

IV

A
The Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment provides:"[N]or shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation." The aim of the Clause is to preventthe government "from forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borneby the public as a whole." Armstrong v. United States, 364
U. S. 40, 49 (1960).This case does not present the "classi[c] taking" in which
the government directly appropriates private property forits own use. See

United States v. Security IndustrialBank, 459 U. S. 70, 78 (1982). Although takings problems

are more commonly presented when "the interference withproperty can be characterized as a physical invasion by government, than when interference arises from some publicprogram adjusting the benefits and burdens of economic life
to promote the common good," Penn Central Transp. Co. v.
New York City, 438 U. S. 104, 124 (1978) (citation omitted),

economic regulation such as the Coal Act may nonethelesseffect a taking, see

Security Industrial Bank, supra, at 78.
See also Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 388 (1798) (opinion ofChase, J.) ("It is against all reason and justice" to presume

that the legislature has been entrusted with the power to
enact "a law that takes property from A. and gives it to B").By operation of the Act, Eastern is "permanently deprived

of those assets necessary to satisfy its statutory obligation,not to the Government, but to [the Combined Fund],"

Connolly, supra, at 222, and "a strong public desire to improvethe public condition is not enough to warrant achieving the

desire by a shorter cut than the constitutional way of paying
for the change," Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U. S.
393, 416 (1922).

Of course, a party challenging governmental action as an
unconstitutional taking bears a substantial burden. See
United States v. Sperry Corp., 493 U. S. 52, 60 (1989). Government regulation often "curtails some potential for the use
or economic exploitation of private property," Andrus v. Allard, 444 U. S. 51, 65 (1979), and "not every destruction or
injury to property by governmental action has been held to
be a `taking' in the constitutional sense," Armstrong, supra,
at 48. In light of that understanding, the process for evaluating a regulation's constitutionality involves an examination
of the "justice and fairness" of the governmental action.
See Andrus, 444 U. S., at 65. That inquiry, by its nature,
does not lend itself to any set formula, see ibid., and the
determination whether " `justice and fairness' require that
economic injuries caused by public action [must] be compensated by the government, rather than remain disproportionately concentrated on a few persons," is essentially ad hoc
and fact intensive, Kaiser Aetna v. United States, 444 U. S.
164, 175 (1979) (internal quotation marks omitted). We have
identified several factors, however, that have particular significance: "[T]he economic impact of the regulation, its interference with reasonable investment backed expectations, and

the character of the governmental action." Ibid.; see alsoConnolly, supra, at 224-225.

Our analysis in this case is informed by previous decisionsconsidering the constitutionality of somewhat similar legislative schemes. In Usery v. Turner Elkhorn Mining Co., 428U. S. 1 (1976), we had occasion to review provisions of the
Black Lung Benefits Act of 1972, 30 U. S. C. $ 901 et seq.,which required coal operators to compensate certain miners
and their survivors for death or disability due to black lungdisease caused by employment in coal mines. Coal operators challenged the provisions of the Act relating to minerswho were no longer employed in the industry, arguing that
those provisions violated substantive due process by im-posing "an unexpected liability for past, completed acts
that were legally proper and, at least in part, unknown to bedangerous at the time." 428 U. S., at 15.

In rejecting the operators' challenge, we explained that"legislative Acts adjusting the burdens and benefits of economic life come to the Court with a presumption of con-stitutionality, and . . . the burden is on one complaining
of a due process violation to establish that the legislaturehas acted in an arbitrary and irrational way."

Ibid. Weobserved that stricter limits may apply to Congress' authority when legislation operates in a retroactive manner, id., at16-17, but concluded that the assignment of liability for black
lung benefits was "justified as a rational measure to spreadthe costs of the employees' disabilities to those who have
profited from the fruits of their labor," id., at 18.Several years later, we confronted a due process challenge to the Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Actof 1980 (MPPAA), 94 Stat. 1208. See

Pension Benefit Guar-anty Corporation v. R. A. Gray & Co., 467 U. S. 717 (1984).

The MPPAA was enacted to supplement ERISA, 29 U. S. C.$ 1001 et seq., which established the Pension Benefit Guar524US2 Unit: $U94 [09-11-00 13:26:39] PAGES PGT: OPLG

525Cite as: 524 U. S. 498 (1998)
Opinion of O'Connor, J.
anty Corporation (PBGC) to administer an insurance pro-gram for vested pension benefits. For a temporary period,

the PBGC had discretionary authority to pay benefits uponthe termination of multiemployer pension plans, after which
insurance coverage would become mandatory. If the PBGC
exercised that authority, employers who had contributed tothe plan during the five years before its termination faced

liability for an amount proportional to their share of con-tributions to the plan during that period. See 467 U. S., at
720-721.Despite Congress' effort to insure multiemployer plan benefits through ERISA, many multiemployer plans were in a
precarious financial position as the date for mandatory coverage approached. After a series of hearings and debates,
Congress passed the MPPAA, which imposed a payment
obligation upon any employer withdrawing from a multiemployer pension plan, the amount of which depended on the
employer's share of the plan's unfunded vested benefits.
The MPPAA applied retroactively to withdrawals within
the five months preceding the statute's enactment. Id., at
721-725.

In Gray, an employer that had participated in a multiemployer pension plan brought a due process challenge to the
statutory liability stemming from its withdrawal from the
plan four months before the MPPAA was enacted. Relying
on our decision in Turner Elkhorn, we rejected the employer's claim. It was rational, we determined, for Congress to
impose retroactive liability "to prevent employers from taking advantage of a lengthy legislative process [by] withdrawing while Congress debated necessary revisions in the statute." 467 U. S., at 731. In addition, we explained, "as the
[MPPAA] progressed through the legislative process, Congress advanced the effective date chosen so that it would
encompass only that retroactive time period that Congress
believed would be necessary to accomplish its purposes."
Ibid. Accordingly, we concluded that the MPPAA exem524US2 Unit: $U94 [09-11-00 13:26:39] PAGES PGT: OPLG

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
plified the "customary congressional practice" of enacting"retroactive statutes confined to short and limited periods

required by the practicalities of producing national legisla-tion."

Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).
This Court again considered the constitutionality of the
MPPAA in Connolly v. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, 475 U. S. 211 (1986), which presented the question
whether the MPPAA's withdrawal liability provisions ef-fected an unconstitutional taking. The action was brought

by trustees of a multiemployer pension plan that, under col-lective bargaining agreements, received contributions from
employers on the basis of the hours worked by their employees. We agreed that the liability imposed by the MPPAA
constituted a permanent deprivation of assets, but we rejected the notion that "such a statutory liability to a private
party always constitutes an uncompensated taking prohibited by the Fifth Amendment." Id., at 222. "In the course
of regulating commercial and other human affairs," we explained, "Congress routinely creates burdens for some that
directly benefit others." Id., at 223. Consistent with our
decisions in Gray and Turner Elkhorn, we reasoned that
legislation is not unlawful solely because it upsets otherwise
settled expectations.

Moreover, given our holding in Gray that the MPPAA did
not violate due process, we concluded that "it would be surprising indeed to discover" that the statute effected a taking.
475 U. S., at 223. Although the employers in Connolly had
contractual agreements expressly limiting their contributions to the multiemployer plan, we observed that "[c]ontracts, however express, cannot fetter the constitutional authority of Congress" and "the fact that legislation disregards
or destroys existing contractual rights does not always
transform the regulation into an illegal taking." Id., at 223-
224 (internal quotation marks omitted). Focusing on the
three factors of "particular significance"--the economic impact of the regulation, the extent to which the regulation

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
interferes with investment-backed expectations, and thecharacter of the governmental action--we determined that

the MPPAA did not violate the Takings Clause. Id., at 225.The governmental action at issue in

Connolly was not
a physical invasion of employers' assets; rather, it "safeguard[ed] the participants in multiemployer pension plans byrequiring a withdrawing employer to fund its share of the

plan obligations incurred during its association with theplan."

Ibid. In addition, although the amounts assessed
under the MPPAA were substantial, we found it importantthat "[t]he assessment of withdrawal liability [was] not made

in a vacuum, . . . but directly depend[ed] on the relationship
between the employer and the plan to which it had made
contributions." Ibid. Further, "a significant number of
provisions in the Act . . . moderate[d] and mitigate[d] the
economic impact of an individual employer's liability." Id.,
at 225-226. Accordingly, we found "nothing to show that
the withdrawal liability actually imposed on an employer
w[ould] always be out of proportion to its experience with
the plan." Id., at 226. Nor did the MPPAA interfere with
employers' reasonable investment-backed expectations, for,
by the time of the MPPAA's enactment, "[p]rudent employers . . . had more than sufficient notice not only that pension
plans were currently regulated, but also that withdrawal itself might trigger additional financial obligations." Id., at
227. For those reasons, we determined that "fairness and
justice" did not require anyone other than the withdrawing
employers and the remaining parties to the pension agreements to bear the burden of funding employees' vested benefits. Ibid.

We once more faced challenges to the MPPAA under the
Due Process and Takings Clauses in Concrete Pipe & Products of Cal., Inc. v. Construction Laborers Pension Trust
for Southern Cal., 508 U. S. 602 (1993). In that case, the
employer focused on the fact that its contractual commitment
to the multiemployer plan did not impose withdrawal liabil524US2 Unit: $U94 [09-11-00 13:26:39] PAGES PGT: OPLG

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
ity. We first rejected the employer's substantive due proc-ess challenge based on our decisions in

Gray and Turner
Elkhorn, notwithstanding the employer's argument that theMPPAA imposed upon it a higher liability than its contract

contemplated. 508 U. S., at 636-641. The claim under the
Takings Clause, meanwhile, was resolved by Connolly. Weexplained that, as in that case, the Government had not occupied or destroyed the employer's property. 508 U. S., at643-644. As to the severity of the MPPAA's impact, we
concluded that the employer had not shown that its with-drawal liability was " `out of proportion to its experience
with the plan' " Id., at 645 (quoting Connolly, supra, at
226). Turning to the employer's reasonable investmentbacked expectations, we repeated our observation in Connolly that "pension plans had long been subject to federal
regulation." 508 U. S., at 645. Moreover, although the employer's liability under the MPPAA exceeded ERISA's original cap on withdrawal liability, we found that there was "no
reasonable basis to expect that [ERISA's] legislative ceiling
would never be lifted." Id., at 646. In sum, as in Connolly,
the employer "voluntarily negotiated and maintained a pension plan which was determined to be within the strictures
of ERISA," making the burden the MPPAA imposed upon
it neither unfair nor unjust. 508 U. S., at 646-647 (internal
quotation marks omitted).

Our opinions in Turner Elkhorn, Connolly, and Concrete
Pipe make clear that Congress has considerable leeway to
fashion economic legislation, including the power to affect
contractual commitments between private parties. Congress also may impose retroactive liability to some degree,
particularly where it is "confined to short and limited periods
required by the practicalities of producing national legislation." Gray, 467 U. S., at 731 (internal quotation marks
omitted). Our decisions, however, have left open the possibility that legislation might be unconstitutional if it imposes severe retroactive liability on a limited class of parties

524US2 Unit: $U94 [09-11-00 13:26:39] PAGES PGT: OPLG

529Cite as: 524 U. S. 498 (1998)
Opinion of O'Connor, J.
that could not have anticipated the liability, and the extentof that liability is substantially disproportionate to the parties' experience. C

We believe that the Coal Act's allocation scheme, as ap-plied to Eastern, presents such a case. We reach that conclusion by applying the three factors that traditionally haveinformed our regulatory takings analysis. Although

Justice Kennedy and Justice Breyer would pursue a differ-ent course in evaluating the constitutionality of the Coal Act,

they acknowledge that this Court's opinions in Connolly and
Concrete Pipe indicate that the regulatory takings frame-work is germane to legislation of this sort. See post, at 545-

546 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment and dissenting inpart); post, at 555-556 (

Breyer, J., dissenting).As to the first factor relevant in assessing whether a regulatory taking has occurred, economic impact, there is nodoubt that the Coal Act has forced a considerable financial
burden upon Eastern. The parties estimate that Eastern'scumulative payments under the Act will be on the order of
$50 to $100 million. See Brief for Petitioner 2 ($100 million);Brief for Respondents UMWA Combined Benefit Fund et al.
46 ($51 million). Eastern's liability is thus substantial, andthe company is clearly deprived of the amounts it must pay
the Combined Fund. See Connolly, 475 U. S., at 222. Thefact that the Federal Government has not specified the assets
that Eastern must use to satisfy its obligation does not ne-gate that impact. It is clear that the Act requires Eastern
to turn over a dollar amount established by the Commis-sioner under a timetable set by the Act, with the threat of
severe penalty if Eastern fails to comply. See 26 U. S. C.$$ 9704(a) and (b) (directing liable operators to pay annual
premiums as computed by the Commissioner); $ 9707 (impos-ing, with limited exceptions, a penalty of $100 per day per
eligible beneficiary if payment is not made in accordancewith $ 9704).

530 EASTERN ENTERPRISES v. APFEL

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
That liability is not, of course, a permanent physical occu-pation of Eastern's property of the kind that we have viewed

as a per se taking. See Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan
CATV Corp., 458 U. S. 419, 441 (1982). But our decisions
upholding the MPPAA suggest that an employer's statutory
liability for multiemployer plan benefits should reflect some"proportion[ality] to its experience with the plan."

Concrete
Pipe, 508 U. S., at 645 (internal quotation marks omitted);see also

Connolly, supra, at 225 (noting that employer's liability under the MPPAA "directly depend[ed] on the rela-tionship between the employer and the plan to which it had

made contributions"). In Concrete Pipe and Connolly, the
employers had "voluntarily negotiated and maintained a pension plan which was determined to be within the strictures
of ERISA," Concrete Pipe, supra, at 646 (internal quotation marks omitted); Connolly, supra, at 227, and consequently, the statutory liability was linked to the employers'
conduct.

Here, however, while Eastern contributed to the 1947 and
1950 W&R Funds, it ceased its coal mining operations in
1965 and neither participated in negotiations nor agreed to
make contributions in connection with the Benefit Plans
under the 1974, 1978, or subsequent NBCWA's. It is the
latter agreements that first suggest an industry commitment
to the funding of lifetime health benefits for both retirees
and their family members. Although EACC continued mining coal until 1987 as a subsidiary of Eastern, Eastern's liability under the Act bears no relationship to its ownership of
EACC; the Act assigns Eastern responsibility for benefits
relating to miners that Eastern itself, not EACC, employed,
while EACC would be assigned the responsibility for any
miners that it had employed. See 26 U. S. C. $ 9706(a).
Thus, the Act does not purport, as Justice Breyer suggests, post, at 566, to assign liability to Eastern based on the
" `last man out' problem" that developed after benefits were
significantly expanded in 1974. During the years in which

524US2 Unit: $U94 [09-11-00 13:26:39] PAGES PGT: OPLG

531Cite as: 524 U. S. 498 (1998)
Opinion of O'Connor, J.
Eastern employed miners, retirement and health benefitswere far less extensive than under the 1974 NBCWA, were

unvested, and were fully subject to alteration or termination.Before 1974, as

Justice Breyer notes, Eastern could not
have contemplated liability for the provision of lifetime benefits to the widows of deceased miners, see post, at 562-563,a beneficiary class that is likely to be substantial. See General Accounting Office, Human Resources Division Report,Retired Coal Miners' Health Benefits 7 (July 1992) (reporting
to Congress that widows composed 45% of beneficiaries inJan. 1992); see also Brief for Petitioner 45, n. 54 (citing affidavit that 75% of the beneficiaries assigned to Eastern are
spouses or dependent children of miners). Although Eastern at one time employed the Combined Fund beneficiaries
that it has been assigned under the Coal Act, the correlation
between Eastern and its liability to the Combined Fund is
tenuous, and the amount assessed against Eastern resembles
a calculation "made in a vacuum." See Connolly, supra, at
225. The company's obligations under the Act depend solely
on its roster of employees some 30 to 50 years before the
statute's enactment, without any regard to responsibilities
that Eastern accepted under any benefit plan the company
itself adopted.

It is true that Eastern may be able to seek indemnification
from EACC or Peabody. But although the Act preserves
Eastern's right to pursue indemnification, see 26 U. S. C.

$ 9706(f)(6), it does not confer any right of reimbursement.
See also Conference Report on Coal Act, 138 Cong. Rec., at
34004 (explaining that the Coal Act allows parties to "enter
into private litigation to enforce . . . contracts for indemnification," but "does not create new private rights of action").
Moreover, the possibility of indemnification does not alter
the fact that Eastern has been assessed over $5 million in
Combined Fund premiums and that its liability under the
Coal Act will continue for many years. To the extent that
Eastern may have entered into contractual arrangements to

524US2 Unit: $U94 [09-11-00 13:26:39] PAGES PGT: OPLG
532 EASTERN ENTERPRISES v. APFEL

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
insure itself against liabilities arising out of its former coaloperations, that indemnity is neither enhanced nor supplanted by the Coal Act and does not affect the availabilityof the declaratory relief Eastern seeks.

We are also not persuaded by respondents' argument that
the Coal Act "moderate[s] and mitigate[s] the economic im-pact" upon Eastern. See

Connolly, 475 U. S., at 225-226.
Although Eastern is not assigned the premiums for formeremployees who later worked for companies that signed the

1978 NBCWA, see 26 U. S. C. $$ 9706(a)(1), (2), Eastern hadno control over the activities of its former employees subsequent to its departure from the coal industry in 1965. By
contrast, the provisions of the MPPAA that we identified as
potentially moderating the employer's liability in Connolly
were generally within the employer's control. See 475 U. S.,
at 226, n. 8. The mere fact that Eastern is not forced to bear
the burden of lifetime benefits respecting all of its former
employees does not mean that the company's liability for
some of those employees is not a significant economic burden.

For similar reasons, the Coal Act substantially interferes
with Eastern's reasonable investment-backed expectations.
The Act's beneficiary allocation scheme reaches back 30 to
50 years to impose liability against Eastern based on the
company's activities between 1946 and 1965. Thus, even
though the Act mandates only the payment of future health
benefits, it nonetheless "attaches new legal consequences to
[an employment relationship] completed before its enactment." Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U. S. 244, 270
(1994).

Retroactivity is generally disfavored in the law, Bowen v.
Georgetown Univ. Hospital, 488 U. S. 204, 208 (1988), in accordance with "fundamental notions of justice" that have
been recognized throughout history, Kaiser Aluminum &
Chemical Corp. v. Bonjorno, 494 U. S. 827, 855 (1990)
(Scalia, J., concurring). See also, e. g., Dash v. Van Kleeck,

lish common law, as ancient as the law itself, that a statute,even of its omnipotent parliament, is not to have a retrospective effect"); H. Broom, Legal Maxims 24 (8th ed. 1911)("Retrospective laws are, as a rule, of questionable policy,
and contrary to the general principle that legislation by
which the conduct of mankind is to be regulated ought todeal with future acts, and ought not to change the character

of past transactions carried on upon the faith of the thenexisting law"). In his Commentaries on the Constitution,
Justice Story reasoned: "Retrospective laws are, indeed, gen-erally unjust; and, as has been forcibly said, neither accord
with sound legislation nor with the fundamental principles
of the social compact." 2 J. Story, Commentaries on the
Constitution $ 1398 (5th ed. 1891). A similar principle
abounds in the laws of other nations. See, e. g., Gustavson
Drilling (1964) Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue, 66
D. L. R. 3d 449, 462 (Can. 1975) (discussing rule that statutes
should not be construed in a manner that would impair existing property rights); The French Civil Code, Preliminary
Title, Art. 2, p. 2 ("Legislation only provides for the future;
it has no retroactive effect") (J. Crabb transl., rev. ed. 1995);
Aarnio, Statutory Interpretation in Finland 151, in Interpreting Statutes: A Comparative Study (D. MacCormick &
R. Summers eds. 1991) (discussing prohibition against retroactive legislation). "Retroactive legislation," we have explained, "presents problems of unfairness that are more serious than those posed by prospective legislation, because it
can deprive citizens of legitimate expectations and upset
settled transactions." General Motors Corp. v. Romein, 503
U. S. 181, 191 (1992).

Our Constitution expresses concern with retroactive laws
through several of its provisions, including the Ex Post Facto
and Takings Clauses. Landgraf, supra, at 266. In Calder
v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386 (1798), this Court held that the Ex Post
Facto Clause is directed at the retroactivity of penal legislation, while suggesting that the Takings Clause provides

524US2 Unit: $U94 [09-11-00 13:26:39] PAGES PGT: OPLG
534 EASTERN ENTERPRISES v. APFEL

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
a similar safeguard against retrospective legislation con-cerning property rights. See

id., at 394 (opinion of Chase,
J.) ("The restraint against making any ex post facto lawswas not considered, by the framers of the constitution, as

extending to prohibit the depriving a citizen even of a vested
right to property; or the provision, `that private propertyshould not be taken for public use, without just compensation,' was unnecessary"). In Security Industrial Bank, weconsidered a Takings Clause challenge to a Bankruptcy Code
provision permitting debtors to avoid certain liens, possiblyincluding those predating the statute's enactment. We expressed "substantial doubt whether the retroactive destruction of the appellees' liens . . . comport[ed] with the Fifth
Amendment," and therefore construed the statute as applying only to lien interests vesting after the legislation took
effect. 459 U. S., at 78-79. Similar concerns led this Court
to strike down a bankruptcy provision as an unconstitutional
taking where it affected substantive rights acquired before
the provision was adopted. Louisville Joint Stock Land
Bank v. Radford, 295 U. S. 555, 601-602 (1935).

Like those provisions, the Coal Act operates retroactively,
divesting Eastern of property long after the company believed its liabilities under the 1950 W&R Fund to have been
settled. And the extent of Eastern's retroactive liability is
substantial and particularly far reaching. Even in areas in
which retroactivity is generally tolerated, such as tax legislation, some limits have been suggested. See, e. g., United
States v. Darusmont, 449 U. S. 292, 296-297 (1981) (per curiam) (noting Congress' practice of confining retroactive application of tax provisions to "short and limited periods").
The distance into the past that the Act reaches back to
impose a liability on Eastern and the magnitude of that
liability raise substantial questions of fairness. See Connolly, supra, at 229 (O'Connor, J., concurring) (questioning
constitutionality of imposing liability on "employers for unfunded benefits that accrued in the past under a pension plan

524US2 Unit: $U94 [09-11-00 13:26:39] PAGES PGT: OPLG

535Cite as: 524 U. S. 498 (1998)
Opinion of O'Connor, J.
whether or not the employers had agreed to ensure that ben-efits would be fully funded"); see also

Landgraf, 511 U. S.,
at 265 ("Elementary considerations of fairness dictate thatindividuals should have an opportunity to know what the law

is and to conform their conduct accordingly; settled expectations should not be lightly disrupted").Respondents and their

amici curiae assert that the extent of retroactive liability is justified because there wasan implicit, industrywide agreement during the time that

Eastern was involved in the coal industry to fund lifetimehealth benefits for qualifying miners and their dependents.
That contention, however, is not supported by the pre-1974
NBCWA's. No contrary conclusion can be drawn from the
few isolated statements of individuals involved in the coal
industry, see, e. g., Brief for Respondents Peabody Holding
Company, Inc., et al. 8-10, or from statements of Members
of Congress while considering legislative responses to the
issue of funding retiree benefits. Moreover, even though
retirees received medical benefits before 1974, and perhaps
developed a corresponding expectation that those benefits
would continue, the Coal Act imposes liability respecting
a much broader range of beneficiaries. In any event, the
question is not whether miners had an expectation of lifetime
benefits, but whether Eastern should bear the cost of those
benefits as to miners it employed before 1966.

Eastern only participated in the 1947 and 1950 W&R
Funds, which operated on a pay-as-you-go basis, and under
which the degree of benefits and the classes of beneficiaries
were subject to the trustees' discretion. Not until 1974,
when ERISA forced revisions to the 1950 W&R Fund, could
lifetime medical benefits under the multiemployer agreement
have been viewed as promised. Eastern was no longer in
the industry when the evergreen and guarantee clauses of
the 1978 and subsequent NBCWA's shifted the 1950 and 1974
Benefit Plans from a defined contribution framework to a
guarantee of defined benefits, at least for the life of the

agreements. See Connolly, 475 U. S., at 230-231 (O'Connor, J., concurring) (imposition of liability "without regard
to the extent of a particular employer's actual responsibility
for [a benefit] plan's promise of fixed benefits to employees"
could raise serious concerns under the Takings Clause).
Thus, unlike the pension withdrawal liability upheld in Concrete Pipe and Connolly, the Coal Act's scheme for allocation
of Combined Fund premiums is not calibrated either to Eastern's past actions or to any agreement--implicit or otherwise--by the company. Nor would the pattern of the Federal Government's involvement in the coal industry have
given Eastern "sufficient notice" that lifetime health benefits
might be guaranteed to retirees several decades later. See
Connolly, supra, at 227.

Eastern's liability also differs from coal operators' responsibility for benefits under the Black Lung Benefits Act of
1972. That legislation merely imposed "liability for the
effects of disabilities bred in the past [that] is justified as a
rational measure to spread the costs of the employees' disabilities to those who have profited from the fruits of their
labor." Turner Elkhorn, 428 U. S., at 18. Likewise, Eastern might be responsible for employment-related health
problems of all former employees whether or not the cost
was foreseen at the time of employment, see id., at 16, but
there is no such connection here. There is no doubt that
many coal miners sacrificed their health on behalf of this
country's industrial development, and we do not dispute that
some members of the industry promised lifetime medical
benefits to miners and their dependents during the 1970's.
Nor do we, as Justice Stevens suggests, post, at 553, question Congress' policy decision that the miners are entitled to
relief. But the Constitution does not permit a solution to
the problem of funding miners' benefits that imposes such
a disproportionate and severely retroactive burden upon
Eastern.

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
Finally, the nature of the governmental action in this caseis quite unusual. That Congress sought a legislative remedy

for what it perceived to be a grave problem in the fundingof retired coal miners' health benefits is understandable;
complex problems of that sort typically call for a legislativesolution. When, however, that solution singles out certain
employers to bear a burden that is substantial in amount,based on the employers' conduct far in the past, and unrelated to any commitment that the employers made or toany injury they caused, the governmental action implicates
fundamental principles of fairness underlying the TakingsClause. Eastern cannot be forced to bear the expense of
lifetime health benefits for miners based on its activities dec-ades before those benefits were promised. Accordingly, in
the specific circumstances of this case, we conclude that theCoal Act's application to Eastern effects an unconstitutional
taking. D

Eastern also claims that the manner in which the Coal Actimposes liability upon it violates substantive due process.
To succeed, Eastern would be required to establish that itsliability under the Act is "arbitrary and irrational." Turner
Elkhorn, supra, at 15. Our analysis of legislation under theTakings and Due Process Clauses is correlated to some extent, see Connolly, supra, at 223, and there is a questionwhether the Coal Act violates due process in light of the
Act's severely retroactive impact. At the same time, thisCourt has expressed concerns about using the Due Process

and industrial conditions, because they may be unwise, im-provident, or out of harmony with a particular school of

thought"). Because we have determined that the third tierof the Coal Act's allocation scheme violates the Takings
Clause as applied to Eastern, we need not address Eastern'sdue process claim. Nor do we consider the first two tiers of
the Act's allocation scheme, 26 U. S. C. $$ 9706(a)(1) and (2),as the liability that has been imposed on Eastern arises only
under the third tier. Cf. Printz v. United States, 521 U. S.898, 934-935 (1997).

V
In enacting the Coal Act, Congress was responding toa serious problem with the funding of health benefits for

retired coal miners. While we do not question Congress'power to address that problem, the solution it crafted improperly places a severe, disproportionate, and extremelyretroactive burden on Eastern. Accordingly, we conclude
that the Coal Act's allocation of liability to Eastern violatesthe Takings Clause, and that 26 U. S. C. $ 9706(a)(3) should
be enjoined as applied to Eastern. The judgment of theCourt of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for
further proceedings. It is so ordered.

Justice Thomas, concurring.
Justice O'Connor's opinion correctly concludes that theCoal Act's imposition of retroactive liability on petitioner violates the Takings Clause. I write separately to emphasizethat the Ex Post Facto Clause of the Constitution, Art. I,

Commentaries on the Constitution $ 1398, p. 272 (5th ed.1891). Since

Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386 (1798), however,this Court has considered the Ex Post Facto Clause to apply

only in the criminal context. I have never been convincedof the soundness of this limitation, which in Calder was

principally justified because a contrary interpretation wouldrender the Takings Clause unnecessary. See id., at 394

(opinion of Chase, J.). In an appropriate case, therefore,I would be willing to reconsider Calder and its progeny to
determine whether a retroactive civil law that passes mus-ter under our current Takings Clause jurisprudence is nonetheless unconstitutional under the Ex Post Facto Clause.Today's case, however, does present an unconstitutional
taking, and I join Justice O'Connor's well-reasoned opin-ion in full.

Justice Kennedy, concurring in the judgment and dis-senting in part.
The plurality's careful assessment of the history and pur-pose of the statute in question demonstrates the necessity to
hold it arbitrary and beyond the legitimate authority of theGovernment to enact. In my view, which is in full accord
with many of the plurality's conclusions, the relevant por-tions of the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 1992
(Coal Act), 26 U. S. C. $ 9701 et seq. (1994 ed. and Supp. II),must be invalidated as contrary to essential due process
principles, without regard to the Takings Clause of the FifthAmendment. I concur in the judgment holding the Coal Act
unconstitutional but disagree with the plurality's TakingsClause analysis, which, it is submitted, is incorrect and quite
unnecessary for decision of the case. I must record my re-spectful dissent on this issue.

The final Clause of the Fifth Amendment states:

"[N]or shall private property be taken for public use,without just compensation." U. S. Const., Amdt. 5.

The provision is known as the Takings Clause. The conceptof a taking under the Clause has become a term of art, and
my discussion begins here.

540 EASTERN ENTERPRISES v. APFEL

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
Our cases do not support the plurality's conclusion that theCoal Act takes property. The Coal Act imposes a staggering financial burden on the petitioner, Eastern Enterprises,but it regulates the former mine owner without regard to
property. It does not operate upon or alter an identified
property interest, and it is not applicable to or measuredby a property interest. The Coal Act does not appropriate,

transfer, or encumber an estate in land (e. g., a lien on a par-ticular piece of property), a valuable interest in an intangible
(e. g., intellectual property), or even a bank account or ac-crued interest. The law simply imposes an obligation to
perform an act, the payment of benefits. The statute is indifferent as to how the regulated entity elects to comply or
the property it uses to do so. To the extent it affects property interests, it does so in a manner similar to many laws;
but until today, none were thought to constitute takings. To
call this sort of governmental action a taking as a matter of
constitutional interpretation is both imprecise and, with all
due respect, unwise.

As the role of Government expanded, our experience
taught that a strict line between a taking and a regulation
is difficult to discern or to maintain. This led the Court in
Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U. S. 393 (1922), to try
to span the two concepts when specific property was subjected to what the owner alleged to be excessive regulation.
"The general rule at least is, that while property may be
regulated to a certain extent, if regulation goes too far it
will be recognized as a taking." Id., at 415. The quoted
sentence is, of course, the genesis of the so-called regulatory
takings doctrine. See Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal
Council, 505 U. S. 1003, 1014 (1992) ("Prior to Justice
Holmes's exposition in Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, it
was generally thought that the Takings Clause reached only
a `direct appropriation' of property or the functional equivalent of a `practical ouster of [the owner's] possession' " (citations omitted)). Without denigrating the importance the

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
regulatory takings concept has assumed in our law, it is fairto say it has proved difficult to explain in theory and to implement in practice. Cases attempting to decide when aregulation becomes a taking are among the most litigated
and perplexing in current law. See Penn Central Transp.
Co. v. New York City, 438 U. S. 104, 123 (1978) ("The questionof what constitutes a `taking' for purposes of the Fifth

Amendment has proved to be a problem of considerable dif-ficulty");

Kaiser Aetna v. United States, 444 U. S. 164, 175
(1979) (the regulatory taking question requires an "essen-tially ad hoc, factual inquir[y]").

Until today, however, one constant limitation has been that
in all of the cases where the regulatory taking analysis has
been employed, a specific property right or interest has been
at stake. After the decision in Pennsylvania Coal Co. v.
Mahon, supra, we confronted cases where specific and identified properties or property rights were alleged to come
within the regulatory takings prohibition: air rights for
high-rise buildings, Penn Central, supra; zoning on parcels
of real property, e. g., MacDonald, Sommer & Frates v. Yolo
County, 477 U. S. 340 (1986); Agins v. City of Tiburon, 447
U. S. 255 (1980); trade secrets, Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co.,

467 U. S. 986 (1984); right of access to property, e. g., PruneYard Shopping Center v. Robins, 447 U. S. 74 (1980); Kaiser
Aetna, supra; right to affix on structures, Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U. S. 419 (1982); right
to transfer property by devise or intestacy, e. g., Hodel v.
Irving, 481 U. S. 704 (1987); creation of an easement, Dolan
v. City of Tigard, 512 U. S. 374 (1994); Nollan v. California
Coastal Comm'n, 483 U. S. 825 (1987); right to build or improve, Lucas, supra; liens on real property, Armstrong v.

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
v. Central Eureka Mining Co., 357 U. S. 155 (1958). Theregulations in the cited cases were challenged as being so

excessive as to destroy, or take, a specific property interest.The plurality's opinion disregards this requirement and, by
removing this constant characteristic from takings analysis,
would expand an already difficult and uncertain rule to avast category of cases not deemed, in our law, to implicate

the Takings Clause.The difficulties in determining whether there is a taking
or a regulation even where a property right or interest isidentified ought to counsel against extending the regulatory
takings doctrine to cases lacking this specificity. The exist-ence of at least this outer boundary for application of the
regulatory takings rule provides some necessary predictability for governmental entities. Our definition of a taking,after all, is binding on all of the States as well as the Federal

Government. The plurality opinion would throw one of themost difficult and litigated areas of the law into confusion,
subjecting States and municipalities to the potential of newand unforeseen claims in vast amounts. The existing category of cases involving specific property interests ought notto be obliterated by extending regulatory takings analysis
to the amorphous class of cases embraced by the plurality's
opinion today.

True, the burden imposed by the Coal Act may be just as
great if the Government had appropriated one of Eastern's
plants, but the mechanism by which the Government injures
Eastern is so unlike the act of taking specific property that
it is incongruous to call the Coal Act a taking, even as that
concept has been expanded by the regulatory takings principle. In the terminology of our regulatory takings analysis,
the character of the governmental action renders the Coal
Act not a taking of property. While the usual taking occurs
when the government physically acquires property for itself,
e. g., Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. Chicago, 166 U. S. 226 (1897),
our regulatory takings analysis recognizes a taking may
occur when property is not appropriated by the government

or is transferred to other private parties. See, e. g., United
States v. Security Industrial Bank, 459 U. S. 70, 78 (1982)
("[O]ur cases show that takings analysis is not necessarilylimited to outright acquisitions by the government for itself "); Loretto, supra (transfer of physical space from landlords to cable companies).As the range of governmental conduct subjected to takings analysis has expanded, however, we have been carefulnot to lose sight of the importance of identifying the property allegedly taken, lest all governmental action be sub-jected to examination under the constitutional prohibition
against taking without just compensation, with the attendantpotential for money damages. We have asked how the challenged governmental action is implemented with particular
emphasis on the extent to which a specific property right isaffected. See

id., at 432 (physical invasion "is a government
action of such a unique character that it is a taking withoutregard to other factors");

Hodel, supra, at 715-716 (declaring a law, which otherwise would not be a taking because ofits insignificant economic impact, a taking because the character of the governmental action destroyed the right to passproperty to one's heirs, a right which "has been part of the
Anglo-American legal system since feudal times"); Penn
Central, supra, at 124 ("A `taking' may more readily be
found when the interference with property can be characterized as a physical invasion by government, than when interference arises from some public program adjusting the benefits and burdens of economic life to promote the common
good" (citation omitted)). The Coal Act neither targets a
specific property interest nor depends upon any particular
property for the operation of its statutory mechanisms. The
liability imposed on Eastern no doubt will reduce its net
worth and its total value, but this can be said of any law
which has an adverse economic effect.

The circumstance that the statute does not take money for
the Government but instead makes it payable to third persons is not a factor I rely upon to show the lack of a taking.

544 EASTERN ENTERPRISES v. APFEL

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
While there are instances where the Government's self-enrichment may make it all the more evident a taking has

occurred, e. g., Webb's Fabulous Pharmacies, Inc. v. Beckwith, 449 U. S. 155 (1980); United States v. Causby, 328 U. S.
256 (1946), the Government ought not to have the capacity
to give itself immunity from a takings claim by the device ofrequiring the transfer of property from one private owner

directly to another. Cf. Hawaii Housing Authority v. Midkiff, 467 U. S. 229 (1984). At the same time, the Government's imposition of an obligation between private parties,or destruction of an existing obligation, must relate to a specific property interest to implicate the Takings Clause. Forexample, in

United States v. Security Industrial Bank, we
confronted a statute which was alleged to destroy an existing
creditor's lien in certain chattels to the benefit of the debtor.We acknowledged that, given the nature of the property

interest at stake, which resembled a contractual obligation,the takings challenge "fits but awkwardly into the analytic
framework" of our regulatory takings analysis. 459 U. S.,at 75. We decided the analysis could apply because the
property interest was a "traditional property interes[t],"though in the end the statute was found inapplicable to the
lien at issue. In so holding, we relied on Louisville Joint
Stock Land Bank v. Radford, 295 U. S. 555 (1935), which invalidated the Frazier-Lemke Farm-Mortgage Act, because it
interfered with mortgages on farms and thus worked a
" `taking of substantive rights in specific property acquired
by the Bank prior to' " the Act. 459 U. S., at 77 (quoting
Radford, supra, at 590, 601). Unlike the statutes at issue
in Security Industrial Bank and Radford, the Coal Act
does not affect an obligation relating to a specific property
interest.

If the plurality is adopting its novel and expansive concept
of a taking in order to avoid making a normative judgment
about the Coal Act, it fails in the attempt; for it must make
the normative judgment in all events. See, e. g., ante, at 537
("[T]he governmental action implicates fundamental princi524US2 Unit: $U94 [09-11-00 13:26:39] PAGES PGT: OPLG

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
ples of fairness"). The imprecision of our regulatory tak-ings doctrine does open the door to normative considerations

about the wisdom of government decisions. See, e. g., Aginsv. City of Tiburon, 447 U. S., at 260 (zoning constitutes a
taking if it does not "substantially advance legitimate stateinterests"). This sort of analysis is in uneasy tension with
our basic understanding of the Takings Clause, which has not
been understood to be a substantive or absolute limit on thegovernment's power to act. The Clause operates as a conditional limitation, permitting the government to do whatit wants so long as it pays the charge. The Clause presupposes what the government intends to do is otherwiseconstitutional:

"As its language indicates, and as the Court has fre-quently noted, [the Takings Clause] does not prohibit the
taking of private property, but instead places a conditionon the exercise of that power. This basic understanding of the Amendment makes clear that it is designed
not to limit the governmental interference with prop-erty rights per se, but rather to secure compensation

in the event of otherwise proper interference amount-ing to a taking."

First English Evangelical Lutheran
Church of Glendale v. County of Los Angeles, 482 U. S.304, 314-315 (1987) (emphasis and citations omitted).

Given that the constitutionality of the Coal Act appears toturn on the legitimacy of Congress' judgment rather than on
the availability of compensation, see ante, at 521 ("[I]n a casesuch as this one, it cannot be said that monetary relief
against the Government is an available remedy"), the moreappropriate constitutional analysis arises under general due
process principles rather than under the Takings Clause.It should be acknowledged that there are passages in some
of our cases on the imposition of retroactive liability for an
employer's withdrawal from a pension plan which might givesome support to the plurality's discussion of the Takings

Clause. See Connolly v. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corpo524US2 Unit: $U94 [09-11-00 13:26:39] PAGES PGT: OPLG

of Cal., Inc. v. Construction Laborers Pension Trust for
Southern Cal., 508 U. S. 602, 641 (1993). In Connolly, theCourt said the definition of a taking was not controlled by

"any set formula," but was dependent "on ad hoc, factual
inquiries into the circumstances of each particular case."475 U. S., at 224. The Court then applied the three-factor

regulatory takings analysis set forth in Penn Central, whichexamines the economic impact of the regulation, the extent
to which it interferes with investment-backed expectations,and the character of the governmental action. 475 U. S., at
225. This analysis did not result in a finding of a taking.The Court, moreover, prefaced the entire takings discussion
with the admonition it would be surprising to discover that
there had been a taking in the instance where a due processattack had been rejected. See

id., at 223; see also Concrete
Pipe, supra, at 641 ("Given that [the] due process argumentsare unavailing, `it would be surprising indeed to discover'

the challenged statute nonetheless violating the TakingsClause") (quoting

Connolly, supra, at 223). At best, Connolly is equivocal on the question whether we should applythe regulatory takings analysis to instances like the one now

before us. My reading of Connolly, and Concrete Pipe, is
that we should proceed first to general due process principles, reserving takings analysis for cases where the governmental action is otherwise permissible. See Connolly,
supra, at 224 ("[H]ere, the United States has taken nothing
for its own use, and only has nullified a contractual provision
limiting liability by imposing an additional obligation that is
otherwise within the power of Congress to impose"); see also
Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Environmental Study Group,
Inc., 438 U. S. 59, 94, n. 39 (1978) (upholding on due process
grounds the Price-Anderson Act, 42 U. S. C. $ 2210 (1970 ed.,

ed.)). These authorities confirm my view that the case iscontrolled not by the Takings Clause but by well-settled due

process principles respecting retroactive laws.Given my view that the takings analysis is inapplicable
in this case, it is unnecessary to comment upon the plural-ity's effort to resolve a jurisdictional question despite little
briefing by the parties on a point which has divided theCourts of Appeals.

II
When the constitutionality of the Coal Act is tested underthe Due Process Clause, it must be invalidated. Accepted

principles forbidding retroactive legislation of this type aresufficient to dispose of the case.

Although we have been hesitant to subject economic legis-lation to due process scrutiny as a general matter, the Court
has given careful consideration to due process challenges tolegislation with retroactive effects. As today's plurality
opinion notes, for centuries our law has harbored a singulardistrust of retroactive statutes.

Ante, at 532-533. In thewords of Chancellor Kent: "A retroactive statute would partake in its character of the mischiefs of an ex post facto law. . . ; and in every other case relating to contracts or property,
it would be against every sound principle." 1 J. Kent, Com-mentaries on American Law *455; see also

ibid. (rule againstretroactive application of statutes to be "founded not only in

English law, but on the principles of general jurisprudence").Justice Story reached a similar conclusion: "Retrospective
laws are, indeed, generally unjust; and, as has been forciblysaid, neither accord with sound legislation nor with the fundamental principles of the social compact." 2 J. Story, Com-mentaries on the Constitution $ 1398 (5th ed. 1891).

The Court's due process jurisprudence reflects this dis-trust. For example, in

Usery v. Turner Elkhorn MiningCo., 428 U. S. 1, 15 (1976), the Court held due process requires an inquiry into whether in enacting the retroactivelaw the legislature acted in an arbitrary and irrational way.
Even though prospective economic legislation carries with it

524US2 Unit: $U94 [09-11-00 13:26:39] PAGES PGT: OPLG

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
the presumption of constitutionality, "[i]t does not follow . . .that what Congress can legislate prospectively it can legislate retrospectively. The retrospective aspects of [eco-nomic] legislation, as well as the prospective aspects, must
meet the test of due process, and the justifications for the
latter may not suffice for the former." Id., at 16-17. Wehave repeated this formulation in numerous recent decisions

and given serious consideration to retroactivity-based dueprocess challenges, all without questioning the validity of the
underlying due process principle. United States v. Carlton,512 U. S. 26, 31 (1994);

Concrete Pipe, supra, at 636-641;
General Motors Corp. v. Romein, 503 U. S. 181, 191 (1992);
United States v. Sperry Corp., 493 U. S. 52, 64 (1989); United
States v. Hemme, 476 U. S. 558, 567-572 (1986); Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation v. R. A. Gray & Co., 467 U. S.
717, 729-730 (1984). These decisions treat due process challenges based on the retroactive character of the statutes in
question as serious and meritorious, thus confirming the vitality of our legal tradition's disfavor of retroactive economic
legislation. Indeed, it is no accident that the primary retroactivity precedents upon which today's plurality opinion relies in its takings analysis were grounded in due process.
Ante, at 524-528 (citing Turner Elkhorn, R. A. Gray, and
Concrete Pipe).

These cases reflect our recognition that retroactive lawmaking is a particular concern for the courts because of the
legislative "tempt[ation] to use retroactive legislation as a
means of retribution against unpopular groups or individuals." Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U. S. 244, 266
(1994); see also Hochman, The Supreme Court and the Constitutionality of Retroactive Legislation, 73 Harv. L. Rev.
692, 693 (1960) (a retroactive law "may be passed with an
exact knowledge of who will benefit from it"). If retroactive
laws change the legal consequences of transactions long
closed, the change can destroy the reasonable certainty and
security which are the very objects of property ownership.

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
As a consequence, due process protection for property mustbe understood to incorporate our settled tradition against

retroactive laws of great severity. Groups targeted by ret-roactive laws, were they to be denied all protection, would
have a justified fear that a government once formed to protect expectations now can destroy them. Both stability ofinvestment and confidence in the constitutional system, then,

are secured by due process restrictions against severe retro-active legislation.

The case before us represents one of the rare instanceswhere the Legislature has exceeded the limits imposed by
due process. The plurality opinion demonstrates in convincing fashion that the remedy created by the Coal Act bears
no legitimate relation to the interest which the Government
asserts in support of the statute. Ante, at 529-537. In our
tradition, the degree of retroactive effect is a significant
determinant in the constitutionality of a statute. United
States v. Carlton, supra, at 32; United States v. Darusmont,
449 U. S. 292, 296-297 (1981) (per curiam); see also Dunbar
v. Boston & P. R. Corp., 181 Mass. 383, 386, 63 N. E. 916, 917
(1902) (Holmes, C. J.). As the plurality explains today, in
creating liability for events which occurred 35 years ago the
Coal Act has a retroactive effect of unprecedented scope.
Ante, at 532.

While we have upheld the imposition of liability on former
employers based on past employment relationships, the statutes at issue were remedial, designed to impose an "actual,
measurable cost of [the employer's] business" which the employer had been able to avoid in the past. Turner Elkhorn,
supra, at 19; accord, Concrete Pipe, 508 U. S., at 638; Romein, supra, at 191-192; R. A. Gray, supra, at 733-734. As

Chancellor Kent noted: "Such statutes have been held valid
when clearly just and reasonable, and conducive to the general welfare, even though they might operate in a degree
upon existing rights." 1 Kent, Commentaries on American
Law, at *455-*456. The Coal Act, however, does not serve

this purpose. Eastern was once in the coal business andemployed many of the beneficiaries, but it was not responsible for their expectation of lifetime health benefits or for theperilous financial condition of the 1950 and 1974 plans which
put the benefits in jeopardy. As the plurality opinion dis-cusses in detail, the expectation was created by promises and
agreements made long after Eastern left the coal business.Eastern was not responsible for the resulting chaos in the
funding mechanism caused by other coal companies leav-ing the framework of the National Bituminous Coal Wage
Agreement. Ante, at 535-536. This case is far outside thebounds of retroactivity permissible under our law.

Finding a due process violation in this case is consistentwith the principle that "under the deferential standard of
review applied in substantive due process challenges to eco-nomic legislation there is no need for mathematical precision
in the fit between justification and means." Concrete Pipe,supra, at 639 (citing Turner Elkhorn, 428 U. S., at 19).
Statutes may be invalidated on due process grounds onlyunder the most egregious of circumstances. This case represents one of the rare instances in which even such a per-missive standard has been violated.

Application of the Coal Act to Eastern would violate theproper bounds of settled due process principles, and I concur
in the plurality's conclusion that the judgment of the Courtof Appeals must be reversed.

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Souter, Justice
Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer join, dissenting.

Some appellate judges are better historians than others.With respect to the central issue resolved by the Coal Act

between the coal operators and the miners that enabled coalproduction to continue during the 1950's and 1960's depended

more on the value of a handshake than the fine print in writ-ten documents. During that period there was an implicit
understanding on both sides of the bargaining table thatthe operators would provide the miners with lifetime health
benefits. It was this understanding that kept the mines inoperation and enabled Eastern to earn handsome profits
before it transferred its coal business to a wholly owned sub-sidiary in 1965.

My understanding of this critical fact is shared by thejudges of the Seventh Circuit,

2 the Sixth Circuit,3 and the

2 "[E]very [National Bituminous Coal Wage Agreement (NBCWA)] signatory company shared some responsibility in creating a legitimate expectation among miners of lifetime health benefits. Imposing liability on
companies that have profited from the retirees' labor was found rational
in [Usery v. Turner Elkhorn Mining Co., 428 U. S. 1, 18 (1976)] . . . .
Every signatory company, including plaintiffs, participated in the creation
and development of a multi-employer health benefit program that provided
lifetime health benefits for retirees for almost fifty years. Congress could
rationally have concluded that such participation led to a legitimate expectation of lifetime health benefits that should be honored under the Coal
Act. Again, in this light, it would have been arbitrary to draw the line
anywhere other than at all NBCWA signatories. Plaintiffs respond that
it was not until the 1974 NBCWA and the `guarantee' and `evergreen'
clauses of the 1978 NBCWA that miners were promised lifetime health
benefits--promises that plaintiffs never made. Therefore, they argue, it
was irrational for Congress to require contributions from pre-1974 signatories. But the fact that plaintiffs never contractually agreed to provide lifetime benefits does not rebut the rationality of finding that they
contributed to the expectation of lifetime benefits. The Coal Commission
and Congress found that the promise of lifetime benefits dates back to the
1940s, even though it is not explicit in any NBCWA until 1974." Davon,
Inc. v. Shalala, 75 F. 3d 1114, 1124-1125 (1996) (footnote omitted).

3 "Blue Diamond further argues that it was irrational for Congress to

impose Coal Act liability upon Blue Diamond because Blue Diamond did
not promise its employees that they would receive lifetime health benefits. It is undisputed that the NBCWAs did not contain an explicit promise of lifetime benefits until the 1974 NBCWA agreement. However, several federal courts have found that [United Mine Workers of America

First Circuit.4 It is the same understanding that motivatedthe members of the Coal Commission to conclude that the

operators who had employed the "orphaned miners" shouldshare responsibility for their health benefits.

5 And it is

fore the 1974 NBCWA, based on the various funds' more than 30-year
history of continuous payment of benefits and the statements of coal industry officials. Davon, 75 F. 3d at 1124-25 (`Congress could rationally
have concluded that such participation [in the NBCWA benefit funds] led
to a legitimate expectation of lifetime benefits.'). See also Templeton
Coal [Co., Inc. v. Shalala, 882 F. Supp. 799, 825 (SD Ind. 1995)] (describing
basis for lifetime benefits expectation). Congress certainly had a rational
basis for concluding that all NBCWA signatories and `me-too' operators
who agreed to be bound by the NBCWAs, including Blue Diamond, contributed toward the legitimate expectations of the UMWA members." In
re Blue Diamond Coal Co., 79 F. 3d 516, 522 (1996).

4 "[I]t is not accurate to claim that only those [signatory operators] which

executed NBCWAs in or after 1974 created a legitimate expectation of
lifetime health benefits for miners. Congress and the Coal Commission
both reviewed the historical evidence and concluded that pre-1974 signatories had made an implicit commitment to furnish such benefits. . . .

"Of course, the appellant is correct in insisting that the commitment
distilled by Congress from the historical data was not made explicit in the
text of those NBCWAs which were written before 1974. But Eastern
reads too much into that omission. To be sure, such an implied commitment might not be enforceable in a civil suit ex contractu--but this is a
constitutional challenge, not a breach of contract case. For purposes of
due process review, Congress' determination that a commitment was made
need not rest upon a legally enforceable promise; it is enough that Congress' conclusions as to the existence and effects of such a commitment
are rational." Eastern Enterprises v. Chater, 110 F. 3d 150, 157 (1997).

5 "The Commission firmly believes that the retired miners are entitled

to the health care benefits that were promised and guaranteed them and
that such commitments must be honored. . . .. . . . .

"Retired coal miners have legitimate expectations of health care benefits for life; that was the promise they received during their working lives
and that is how they planned their retirement years. That commitment
should be honored. But today those expectations and commitments are
in jeopardy." Secretary of Labor's Advisory Commission on United Mine
Workers of America Retiree Health Benefits, Coal Commission Report
(1990), quoted in App. 237a, 245a-246a.

the same understanding that led legislators in both politi-cal parties to conclude that the Coal Act of 1992 represented

a fair solution to a difficult problem.Given the critical importance of the reasonable expectations of both the miners and the operators during the period
before their implicit agreement was made explicit in 1974,I am unable to agree with the plurality's conclusion that the

retroactive application of the 1992 Act is an unconstitutional"taking" of Eastern's property. Rather, it seems to me that
the plurality and Justice Kennedy have substituted theirjudgment about what is fair for the better informed judgment of the members of the Coal Commission and Congress.6Accordingly, I conclude that, whether the provision in
question is analyzed under the Takings Clause or the DueProcess Clause, Eastern has not carried its burden of overcoming the presumption of constitutionality accorded toan Act of Congress, by demonstrating that the provision is
unsupported by the reasonable expectations of the parties
in interest.

Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Stevens, Justice
Souter, and Justice Ginsburg join, dissenting.

We must decide whether it is fundamentally unfair for
Congress to require Eastern Enterprises to pay the health
care costs of retired miners who worked for Eastern before
1965, when Eastern stopped mining coal. For many years
Eastern benefited from the labor of those miners. Eastern
helped to create conditions that led the miners to expect continued health care benefits for themselves and their families

6 It may well be true that the majority might have been able to fashion
a wiser solution to a difficult problem. Nevertheless, as Chief Justice
Hughes observed in a dissent joined by Justices Brandeis, Stone, and Cardozo: "The power committed to Congress to govern interstate commerce
does not require that its government should be wise, much less that it
should be perfect." Railroad Retirement Bd. v. Alton R. Co., 295 U. S.

after they retired. And Eastern, until 1987, continued todraw sizable profits from the coal industry through a wholly

owned subsidiary. For these reasons, I believe that Con-gress did not act unreasonably or otherwise unjustly in imposing these health care costs upon Eastern. Consequently,in my view, the statute before us is constitutional.

I
As a preliminary matter, I agree with Justice Kennedy,
ante, at 539-547 (opinion concurring in judgment and dis-senting in part), that the plurality views this case through

the wrong legal lens. The Constitution's Takings Clausedoes not apply. That Clause refers to the taking of "private
property . . . for public use, without just compensation."U. S. Const., Amdt. 5. As this language suggests, at the
heart of the Clause lies a concern, not with preventing arbi-trary or unfair government action, but with providing

com-pensation for legitimate government action that takes "private property" to serve the "public" good.The "private property" upon which the Clause traditionally has focused is a specific interest in physical or intellec-tual property. See, e. g., Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New
York City, 438 U. S. 104, 124 (1978); Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., 467 U. S. 986 (1984). It requires compensationwhen the government takes that property for a public purpose. See Dolan v. City of Tigard, 512 U. S. 374, 384 (1994)(Clause requires payment so that government cannot
" `forc[e] some people alone to bear public burdens which, inall fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a
whole' " (quoting Armstrong v. United States, 364 U. S. 40,49 (1960))). This case involves not an interest in physical or
intellectual property, but an ordinary liability to pay money,and not to the Government, but to third parties.

This Court has not directly held that the Takings Clauseapplies to the creation of this kind of liability. The Court
has made clear that not only seizures through eminent do524US2 Unit: $U94 [09-11-00 13:26:39] PAGES PGT: OPLG

Breyer, J., dissenting
main but also certain "takings" through regulation can re-quire "compensation" under the Clause. See,

e. g., Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U. S. 393, 415 (1922) ("[W]hileproperty may be regulated to a certain extent, if regulation

goes too far it will be recognized as a taking"); Lucas v.
South Carolina Coastal Council, 505 U. S. 1003 (1992)(land-use regulation that deprives owner of all economically

beneficial use of property constitutes taking); Nollan v. California Coastal Comm'n, 483 U. S. 825 (1987) (public easement across property may constitute taking). But theseprecedents concern the taking of interests in

physical
property.

The Court has also made clear that the Clause can apply
to monetary interest generated from a fund into which a private individual has paid money. Webb's Fabulous Pharmacies, Inc. v. Beckwith, 449 U. S. 155 (1980). But the monetary interest at issue there arose out of the operation of a
specific, separately identifiable fund of money. And the government took that interest for itself. Here there is no specific fund of money; there is only a general liability; and that
liability runs not to the Government, but to third parties.
Cf., e. g., Armstrong, supra, at 48 (Government destroyed
liens "for its own advantage"); Connolly v. Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation, 475 U. S. 211, 225 (1986) (no taking
where "the Government does not physically invade or permanently appropriate any . . . assets for its own use" (emphasis added)).

The Court in two cases has arguably acted as if the Takings Clause might apply to the creation of a general liability.
Connolly, supra; Concrete Pipe & Products of Cal., Inc. v.
Construction Laborers Pension Trust for Southern Cal., 508
U. S. 602 (1993). But in the first of those cases, the Court
said that the Takings Clause had not been violated, in part
because "the Government does not physically invade or permanently appropriate any . . . assets for its own use." Connolly, 475 U. S., at 225. It also rejected the position that a

taking occurs "whenever legislation requires one person touse his or her assets for the benefit of another."

Id., at 223.
The second case basically followed the analysis of the firstcase.

Concrete Pipe, 508 U. S., at 641-647. And both cases
rejected the claim of a Takings Clause violation. Id., at 646-
647; Connolly, supra, at 227-228.The dearth of Takings Clause authority is not surprising,

for application of the Takings Clause here bristles with con-ceptual difficulties. If the Clause applies when the government simply orders A to pay B, why does it not apply whenthe government simply orders A to pay the government,

i. e.,
when it assesses a tax? Cf. In re Leckie Smokeless Coal
Co., 99 F. 3d 573, 583 (CA4 1996) (characterizing "reachback"
liability payments as a "tax"), cert. denied, 520 U. S. 1118
(1997); In re Chateaugay Corp., 53 F. 3d 478, 498 (CA2 1995)
(same), cert. denied sub nom. LTV Steel Co., Inc. v. Shalala,
516 U. S. 913 (1995). Would that Clause apply to some or to
all statutes and rules that "routinely creat[e] burdens for
some that directly benefit others"? Connolly, supra, at 223.
Regardless, could a court apply the same kind of Takings
Clause analysis when violation means the law's invalidation,
rather than simply the payment of "compensation?" See
First English Evangelical Lutheran Church of Glendale v.
County of Los Angeles, 482 U. S. 304, 315 (1987) ("[The Takings Clause] is designed not to limit the governmental interference with property rights per se, but rather to secure
compensation in the event of otherwise proper interference
amounting to a taking").

We need not face these difficulties, however, for there is
no need to torture the Takings Clause to fit this case. The
question involved--the potential unfairness of retroactive
liability--finds a natural home in the Due Process Clause,
a Fifth Amendment neighbor. That Clause says that no
person shall be "deprive[d] . . . of life, liberty, or property,
without due process of law." U. S. Const., Amdt. 14, $ 1. It
safeguards citizens from arbitrary or irrational legislation.

And the Due Process Clause can offer protection against leg-islation that is unfairly retroactive at least as readily as the

Takings Clause might, for as courts have sometimes sug-gested, a law that is fundamentally unfair because of its retroactivity is a law that is basically arbitrary. See, e. g., Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation v. R. A. Gray & Co., 467U. S. 717, 728-730 (1984);

id., at 730 ("[R]etroactive aspects
of legislation [imposing withdrawal liability on employersparticipating in pension plan] must meet the test of due process"); id., at 733 ("[R]etrospective civil legislation may offenddue process if it is particularly harsh and oppressive" (internal quotation marks omitted)); Usery v. Turner Elkhorn
Mining Co., 428 U. S. 1, 17 (1976). Cf. United States v. Carlton, 512 U. S. 26, 30 (1994) (retroactive tax provision); Welch
v. Henry, 305 U. S. 134, 147 (1938) (same); National Labor
Relations Board v. Guy F. Atkinson Co., 195 F. 2d 141, 149,
151 (CA9 1952) (invalidating administrative order as "arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion," see 5 U. S. C.

$ 706(2)(A), because "[t]he inequity of . . . retroactive policy
making . . . is the sort of thing our system of law abhors").

Nor does application of the Due Process Clause automatically trigger the Takings Clause, just because the word
"property" appears in both. That word appears in the midst
of different phrases with somewhat different objectives,
thereby permitting differences in the way in which the term
is interpreted. Compare, e. g., United States v. Martin
Linen Supply Co., 430 U. S. 564 (1977) ("person" includes corporations for purposes of Fifth Amendment Double Jeopardy
Clause), with Doe v. United States, 487 U. S. 201, 206 (1988)
("person" does not include a corporation for purposes of Fifth
Amendment Self-Incrimination Clause).

Insofar as the plurality avoids reliance upon the Due Process Clause for fear of resurrecting Lochner v. New York,
198 U. S. 45 (1905), and related doctrines of "substantive
due process," that fear is misplaced. Cf. id., at 75-76
(Holmes, J., dissenting); Lincoln Fed. Union v. Northwestern

Breyer, J., dissenting
Iron & Metal Co., 335 U. S. 525, 535 (1949) (repudiating the"Allgeyer-Lochner-Adair-Coppage constitutional doctrine").

As the plurality points out, ante, at 533, an unfair retroactiveassessment of liability upsets settled expectations, and it
thereby undermines a basic objective of law itself. See, e. g.,2 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution $ 1398 (5th ed.
1891) (criticizing retrospective laws as failing to "accord with. . . the fundamental principles of the social compact");

ibid.(retroactive legislation invalid "upon principles derived from

the general nature of free governments, and the necessarylimitations created thereby"); General Motors Corp. v. Romein, 503 U. S. 181, 191 (1992) ("Retroactive legislation . . .can deprive citizens of legitimate expectations");

Fletcher v.Peck, 6 Cranch 87, 143 (1810) (Johnson, J., concurring) (suggesting that retroactive legislation is invalid because it of-fends principles of natural law).

To find that the Due Process Clause protects against thiskind of fundamental unfairness--that it protects against an
unfair allocation of public burdens through this kind of spe-cially arbitrary retroactive means--is to read the Clause in
light of a basic purpose: the fair application of law, whichpurpose hearkens back to the Magna Carta. It is not to
resurrect long-discredited substantive notions of "freedom ofcontract." See,

e. g., Ferguson v. Skrupa, 372 U. S. 726, 729-732 (1963).

Thus, like the plurality I would inquire if the law before usis fundamentally unfair or unjust.

Ante, at 534-537. But Iwould ask this question because, like

Justice Kennedy, Ibelieve that,
if so, the Coal Act would "deprive" Eastern of"property, without due process of law." U. S. Const., Amdt.

14, $ 1. II

The substantive question before us is whether or not itis fundamentally unfair to require Eastern to make future
payments for health care costs of retired miners and theirfamilies, on the basis of Eastern's past association with these

miners. Congress might have assessed all those whonow use coal, or the taxpayer, in order to pay for those retired coal miners' health benefits. But Congress, instead,imposed this liability on Eastern. Coal Industry Retiree
Health Benefit Act of 1992 (Coal Act), 26 U. S. C. $$ 9701-
9722 (1994 ed. and Supp. II). The "fairness" question is,why Eastern?

The answer cannot lie in a contractual promise to pay, forEastern made no such contractual promise. Nor did Eastern participate in any benefit plan that made such a contrac-tual promise, prior to its departure from the coal industry in
1965. But, as Justice Stevens points out, this case is not
a civil law suit for breach of contract. It is a constitutional
challenge to Congress' decision to assess a new future liability on the basis of an old employment relationship. Ante, at
551-552, n. 3 (dissenting opinion). Unless it is fundamentally unfair and unjust, in terms of Eastern's reasonable reliance and settled expectations, to impose that liability, the
Coal Act's "reachback" provision meets that challenge. See
Connolly, 475 U. S., at 227; Concrete Pipe, 508 U. S., at
645-646.

I believe several features of this case demonstrate that the
relationship between Eastern and the payments demanded
by the Coal Act is special enough to pass the Constitution's
fundamental fairness test. That is, even though Eastern
left the coal industry in 1965, the historical circumstances,
taken together, prevent Eastern from showing that the Coal
Act's "reachback" liability provision so frustrates Eastern's
reasonable settled expectations as to impose an unconstitutional liability. Cf. Penn Central, 438 U. S., at 127-128.

For one thing, the liability that the statute imposes upon
Eastern extends only to miners whom Eastern itself employed. See 26 U. S. C. $ 9706(a) (imposing "reachback" liability only where no presently operating coal firm which ratified 1978 or subsequent bargaining agreement ever employed
the retiree, and Eastern employed the retiree longer than

Breyer, J., dissenting
any other "reachback" firm). They are miners whose labor
benefited Eastern when they were younger and healthier.
Insofar as working conditions created a risk of future health
problems for those miners, Eastern created those conditions.
And these factors help to distinguish Eastern from others
with respect to a later obligation to pay the health care costs
that inevitably arise in old age. See, e. g., 138 Cong. Rec.
34001 (1992) (Conference Report on Coal Act) (Coal Act

assigns liability to "those companies which employed the
retirees . . . and thereby benefitted from their services");
Hearings on Provisions Relating to the Health Benefits of
Retired Coal Miners before the House Committee on Ways
and Means, 103d Cong., 1st Sess., 8-9, 32 (1993) (hereinafter
Hearings on Health Benefits); House Committee on Ways and
Means, Financing UMWA Coal Miner "Orphan Retiree"
Health Benefits, 103d Cong., 1st Sess., 50-51 (Comm. Print
1993) (hereinafter House Report).

Congress has sometimes imposed liability, even "retroactive" liability, designed to prevent degradation of a natural
resource, upon those who have used and benefited from it.
See, e. g., Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, 42 U. S. C. $ 9601 et seq.
(1994 ed. and Supp. I). That analogy, while imperfect, calls
attention to the special tie between a firm and its former
employee, a human resource, that helps to explain the special
retroactive liability. That connection, while not by itself
justifying retroactive liability here, helps to distinguish a
firm like Eastern, which employed a miner but no longer
makes coal, from other funding sources, say, current coal producers or coal consumers, who now make or use coal but who
have never employed that miner or benefited from his work.

More importantly, the record demonstrates that Eastern,
before 1965, contributed to the making of an important
"promise" to the miners. That "promise," even if not contractually enforceable, led the miners to "develo[p]" a reasonable "expectation" that they would continue to receive

"[retiree] medical benefits." Ante, at 535. The relevanthistory, outlined below, shows that industry action (including

action by Eastern), combined with Federal Governmentaction and the miners' own forbearance, produced circumstances that made it natural for the miners to believe that
either industry or Government (or both) would make everyeffort to see that they received health benefits after they

retired--regardless of what terms were explicitly includedin previously signed bargaining agreements.

(1) Before the 1940's, health care for miners, insofar as itexisted, was provided by "company doctors" in company
towns. See, e. g., U. S. Dept. of Interior, Report of the CoalMines Administration, A Medical Survey of the BituminousCoal Industry 121, 144 (1947) (hereinafter Boone Report);

By the late 1940's, health care and pension rights had be-come

the issue for miners, a central demand in collective bargaining, and a rallying cry for those who urged a nationwide
coal strike. M. Fox, United We Stand 404, 416 (1990);

the United Mine Workers of America (hereinafter UMWA or
Union), urged the mine owners to " `remove that fear' " of
sudden death from " `their minds so that they will know if
that occurs . . . their families will be provided with proper
insurance.' " Zieger, supra, at 153. In 1946, the workers
struck. The Government seized the mines. And the Government, together with the Union, effectively imposed a
managed health care agreement on the coal operators. Seltzer, supra, at 58.

those at issue here. The bargaining agreements between
the coal operators and miners (NBCWA's) and the W&R
Fund's Annual Reports make clear that the W&R Fund provided benefits to all "employees . . . , their families and dependents for medical or hospital care." 1947 NBCWA 146,

(4) In return for what the miners thought was an assurance (though not a contractual obligation) from management
of continued pension and health care benefits, the Union
agreed to accept mechanization of mining, a concession that
meant significant layoffs and a smaller future work force.
Coal Comm'n Report 11-14, App. (CA1) 1342-1345 (75% decline in employment from 1950 to 1969); Krajcinovic 4, 43-44;
Seltzer, supra, at 36; see also C. Perry, Collective Bargaining
and the Decline of the United Mine Workers 43 (1984) (detailing benefits of mechanization for coal operators). The president of the Southern Coal Operators' Association said in 1953
that the miners "have been promised and grown accustomed
to" health benefits. App. (CA1) 2000. Those benefits, the
management's W&R Fund trustee said in 1951, covered
"mine worker[s], including pensioners, and dependents . . .
without limit as to duration." Id., at 1972. This Court, too,
has said that the UMWA "agreed not to oppose the rapid
mechanization of the mines" in exchange for "increased
wages" and "payments into the welfare fund." Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 U. S. 657, 660 (1965); see also id., at

benefits, and working conditions were a "quid pro quo" forautomation).

Others have reached similar conclusions. The Coal Com-mission more recently said:

"Retired coal miners have legitimate expectations ofhealth care benefits for life; that was the promise they
received during their working lives and that is howthey planned their retirement years. That commitment
should be honored." Coal Comm'n Report 1, App.(CA1) 1332.

And numerous supporters of the present law read the his-tory as showing, for example, that the "miners went to work
each day under the assumption that their health benefitswould be there when they retired." 138 Cong. Rec. 20121
(1992) (Sen. Wofford); see also id., at 20118 (Sen. Rockefeller)
(Coal Act "will see to it that the promise of health care iskept to tens of thousands of retired coal miners and their

families"); id., at 20119 (Sen. Byrd) (Coal Act will "assure . . .retired coal miners . . . that promises made to them during
their working years are not now . . . reneged upon"); id., at20120 (Sen. Ford) (Coal Act assures that "promise made to
[retirees] can be kept"); id., at 34001 (Conference Report onCoal Act) ("Under [NBCWA's], retirees and their dependents
have been promised lifetime health care benefits").

Further, the Federal Government played a significant rolein developing the expectations that these "promises" created.

In 1946, as mentioned above, during a strike related tohealth and pension benefits, the Government seized the
mines and imposed the "Krug-Lewis Agreement," which established the basic health benefits framework. Supra, at
561; see also 11 Fed. Reg. 5593 (1946) (President Truman's
seizure order). In 1948, during a strike related to pension
benefits, the Government again intervened to ensure continued availability of these benefits. 13 Fed. Reg. 1579 (1948)

cinovic 37-38. In later years, but before 1965, Congress pro-vided the W&R Fund with special tax benefits, helped the

Fund to build hospitals, and established health and safetystandards. Brief for Respondents UMWA Combined Benefit Fund et al. 11-12 (citing relevant statutes and record materials). This kind of Government intervention explainswhy the president of the Southern Coal Producers' Association said, in the 1950's, that if benefits were reduced, it was

"entirely conceivable that Congress [would] step in andtake over the mines, assuming responsibility for the welfare collections and payment." App. (CA1) 2000.
I repeat that the Federal Government's words and deeds,
along with those of the pre-1965 industry, did not necessarilycreate contractually binding promises (which, had they existed, might have eliminated the need for this legislation).
But in labor relations, as in human relations, one can createpromises and understandings which, even in the absence of

a legally enforceable contract, others reasonably expect willbe honored. Indeed, in labor relations such industrywide
understandings may spell the difference between labor warand labor peace, for the parties may look to a strike, not to a
court, for enforcement. It is that kind of important, mutualunderstanding that is at issue here. For the record shows
that pre-1965 statements and other conduct led management
to understand, and labor legitimately to expect, that healthcare benefits for retirees and their dependents would continue to be provided.Finally, Eastern continued to obtain profits from the coal
mining industry long after 1965, for it operated a wholly
owned coal-mining subsidiary, Eastern Associated Coal
Corp. (hereinafter EACC), until the late 1980's. Between
1966 and 1987, Eastern effectively ran EACC, sharing officers, supervising management, and receiving 100% of
EACC's approximately $100 million in dividends. Brief for

Bituminous Coal Operators' Association, Inc., as Amicus Curiae 28, and n. 20; Brief for Respondent Peabody Holding
Co., Inc., et al. 14-15, and must have remained aware of theW&R Fund's deepening financial crisis.

Taken together, these circumstances explain why it is notfundamentally unfair for Congress to impose upon Eastern
liability for the future health care costs of miners whom it
long ago employed--rather than imposing that liability, for
example, upon the present industry, coal consumers, or taxpayers. Each diminishes the reasonableness of Eastern's
expectation that, by leaving the industry, it could fall within
the Constitution's protection against unfairly retroactive
liability.

These circumstances, as elaborated by the record, mean
that Eastern knew of the potential funding problems that
arise in any multiemployer benefit plan, see Concrete Pipe,
508 U. S., at 637-639, before it left the industry. Eastern
knew or should have known that, in light of the structure of
the benefit plan and the frequency with which coal operators
went out of business, a "last man out" problem could exacerbate the health plan's funding difficulties. See, e. g., Boone
Report xvi; House Report 34; Coal Commission Report on
Health Benefits of Retired Coal Miners: Hearing before the
Subcommittee on Medicare and Long-Term Care of the Senate Committee on Finance, 102d Cong., 1st Sess., 15, 21
(1991) (statement of Coal Commission Vice Chairman Henry
Perritt, Jr.). Eastern also knew or should have known that
because of prior federal involvement, future federal intervention to solve any such problem was a serious possibility.

Eastern knew, by the very nature of the problem, that anylegislative effort to solve such a problem could well occur

many years into the future. And, most importantly, East-ern played a significant role in creating the miners' expectations that led to this legislation. Add to these circumstances
the two others I have mentioned--that Eastern had bene-fited from the labor of the miners for whose future health

care it must provide, and that Eastern remained in the indus-try, drawing from it substantial profits (though doing business through a subsidiary, which usually, but not always, in-sulates an owner from liability).

The upshot, if I follow the form of analysis this Court used
in Connolly, is that I cannot say the Government's regulation
has unfairly interfered with Eastern's "distinct investmentbacked expectations." See Connolly, supra, at 225-227
(analyzing "taking" in terms of three factors: (1) "economic
impact"; (2) interference " `with distinct investment-backed
expectations' "; and (3) " `character of the governmental action' " (citations omitted)). Within that framework, I could
find additional support for the constitutionality of the "reachback" liability provision by adding that the "character of the
governmental action" here amounts to the creation of a liability to a third party, and not a direct "taking" of an interest in physical property. And the fact that the statute
here narrows Eastern's liability to those whom it employed,
while explicitly preserving Eastern's rights to indemnification from others (thereby helping Eastern spread the risk of
this liability), 26 U. S. C. $ 9706(f)(6), helps to diminish the
Coal Act's "economic impact" upon Eastern as well.

I would put the matter more directly, however. The law
imposes upon Eastern the burden of showing that the statute, because of its retroactive effect, is fundamentally unfair
or unjust. The circumstances I have mentioned convince
me that Eastern cannot show a sufficiently reasonable expectation that it would remain free of future health care cost
liability for the workers whom it employed. Eastern has

therefore failed to show that the law unfairly upset its legiti-mately settled expectations. Because, in my view, Eastern

has not met its burden, I would uphold the "reachback" pro-vision of the Coal Act as constitutional.

NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE ARTS et al.

v. FINLEY et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 97-371. Argued March 31, 1998--Decided June 25, 1998
The National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities Act of 1965 vests

the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) with substantial discretion
to award financial grants to support the arts; it identifies only the broadest funding priorities, including "artistic and cultural significance, giving
emphasis to . . . creativity and cultural diversity," "professional excellence," and the encouragement of "public . . . education . . . and appreciation of the arts." See 20 U. S. C. $$ 954(c)(1)-(10). Applications
for NEA funding are initially reviewed by advisory panels of experts in
the relevant artistic field. The panels report to the National Council
on the Arts (Council), which, in turn, advises the NEA Chairperson.
In 1989, controversial photographs that appeared in two NEA-funded
exhibits prompted public outcry over the agency's grant-making procedures. Congress reacted to the controversy by inserting an amendment into the NEA's 1990 reauthorization bill. The amendment became

$ 954(d)(1), which directs the Chairperson to ensure that "artistic excellence and artistic merit are the criteria by which [grant] applications
are judged, taking into consideration general standards of decency and
respect for the diverse beliefs and values of the American public." The
NEA has not promulgated an official interpretation of the provision, but
the Council adopted a resolution to implement $ 954(d)(1) by ensuring
that advisory panel members represent geographic, ethnic, and esthetic
diversity. The four individual respondents are performance artists who
applied for NEA grants before $ 954(d)(1) was enacted. An advisory
panel recommended approval of each of their projects, but the Council
subsequently recommended disapproval, and funding was denied. They
filed suit for restoration of the recommended grants or reconsideration
of their applications, asserting First Amendment and statutory claims.
When Congress enacted $ 954(d)(1), respondents, now joined by the National Association of Artists' Organizations, amended their complaint to
challenge the provision as void for vagueness and impermissibly viewpoint based. The District Court granted summary judgment in favor
of respondents on their facial constitutional challenge to $ 954(d)(1).

Syllabus
The Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding that $ 954(d)(1), on its face, impermissibly discriminates on the basis of viewpoint and is void for vagueness under the First and Fifth Amendments.

Held: Section 954(d)(1) is facially valid, as it neither inherently interferes

with First Amendment rights nor violates constitutional vagueness
principles. Pp. 580-590.

(a) Respondents confront a heavy burden in advancing their facial
constitutional challenge, and they have not demonstrated a substantial
risk that application of $ 954(d)(1) will lead to the suppression of free
expression, see Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U. S. 601, 615. The premise of respondents' claim is that $ 954(d)(1) constrains the agency's ability
to fund certain categories of artistic expression. The provision, however, simply adds "considerations" to the grant-making process; it does
not preclude awards to projects that might be deemed "indecent" or
"disrespectful," nor place conditions on grants, or even specify that
those factors must be given any particular weight in reviewing an application. Regardless of whether the NEA's view that the formulation of
diverse advisory panels is sufficient to comply with Congress' command
is in fact a reasonable reading, $ 954(d)(1)'s plain text clearly does not
impose a categorical requirement. Furthermore, the political context
surrounding the "decency and respect" clause's adoption is inconsistent
with respondents' assertion. The legislation was a bipartisan proposal
introduced as a counterweight to amendments that would have eliminated the NEA's funding or substantially constrained its grant-making
authority. Section 954(d)(1) merely admonishes the NEA to take "decency and respect" into consideration, and the Court does not perceive
a realistic danger that it will be utilized to preclude or punish the expression of particular views. The Court typically strikes down legislation as facially unconstitutional when the dangers are both more evident
and more substantial. See, e. g., R. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505 U. S. 377.
Given the varied interpretations of the "decency and respect" criteria
urged by the parties, and the provision's vague exhortation to "take
them into consideration," it seems unlikely that $ 954(d)(1) will significantly compromise First Amendment values.

The NEA's enabling statute contemplates a number of indisputably
constitutional applications for both the "decency" and the "respect"
prongs of $ 954(d)(1). It is well established that "decency" is a permissible factor where "educational suitability" motivates its consideration.
See, e. g., Board of Ed., Island Trees Union Free School Dist. No. 26 v.
Pico, 457 U. S. 853, 871. And the statute already provides that the
agency must take "cultural diversity" into account. References to permissible applications would not alone be sufficient to sustain the statute,

524US2 Unit: $U95 [09-06-00 18:40:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN

571Cite as: 524 U. S. 569 (1998)
Syllabus
but neither is the Court persuaded that, in other applications, the language of $ 954(d)(1) itself will give rise to the suppression of protected
expression. Any content-based considerations that may be taken into
account are a consequence of the nature of arts funding; the NEA has
limited resources to allocate among many "artistically excellent" projects, and it does so on the basis of a wide variety of subjective criteria.
Respondent's reliance on Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ.
of Va., 515 U. S. 819, 837--in which the Court overturned a public university's objective decision denying funding to all student publications
having religious editorial viewpoints--is therefore misplaced. The
NEA's mandate is to make esthetic judgments, and the inherently
content-based "excellence" threshold for NEA support sets it apart from
the subsidy at issue in Rosenberger. Moreover, although the First
Amendment applies in the subsidy context, Congress has wide latitude
to set spending priorities. See, e. g., Regan v. Taxation with Representation of Wash., 461 U. S. 540, 549. Unless $ 954(d)(1) is applied in a
manner that raises concern about the suppression of disfavored viewpoints, the Court will uphold it. Pp. 580-588.

(b) The lower courts also erred in invalidating $ 954(d)(1) as unconstitutionally vague. The First and Fifth Amendments protect speakers
from arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement of vague standards.
See NAACP v. Button, 371 U. S. 415, 432-433. Section 954(d)(1)'s
terms are undeniably opaque, and if they appeared in a criminal statute
or regulatory scheme, they could raise substantial vagueness concerns.
It is unlikely, however, that speakers will be compelled to steer too far
clear of any forbidden area in the context of NEA grants. As a practical matter, artists may conform their speech to what they believe to be
the NEA decisionmaking criteria in order to acquire funding. But
when the Government is acting as patron rather than sovereign, the
consequences of imprecision are not constitutionally severe. In the context of selective subsidies, it is not always feasible for Congress to legislate with clarity. Indeed, to accept respondents' vagueness argument
would be to call into question the constitutionality of the many valuable
Government programs awarding scholarships and grants on the basis of
subjective criteria such as "excellence." Pp. 588-590.

I
A

With the establishment of the NEA in 1965, Congress embarked on a "broadly conceived national policy of support for
the . . . arts in the United States," see $ 953(b), pledging
federal funds to "help create and sustain not only a climate
encouraging freedom of thought, imagination, and inquiry
but also the material conditions facilitating the release of . . .
creative talent." $ 951(7). The enabling statute vests the
NEA with substantial discretion to award grants; it identifies only the broadest funding priorities, including "artistic and cultural significance, giving emphasis to American
creativity and cultural diversity," "professional excellence," and the encouragement of "public knowledge, education, understanding, and appreciation of the arts." See

$$ 954(c)(1)-(10).

Applications for NEA funding are initially reviewed by
advisory panels composed of experts in the relevant field of
the arts. Under the 1990 amendments to the enabling statute, those panels must reflect "diverse artistic and cultural
points of view" and include "wide geographic, ethnic, and
minority representation," as well as "lay individuals who are
knowledgeable about the arts." $$ 959(c)(1)-(2). The panels report to the 26-member National Council on the Arts
(Council), which, in turn, advises the NEA Chairperson.
The Chairperson has the ultimate authority to award grants
but may not approve an application as to which the Council
has made a negative recommendation. $ 955(f ).

574 NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR ARTS v. FINLEY

Opinion of the Court
Since 1965, the NEA has distributed over $3 billion ingrants to individuals and organizations, funding that has

served as a catalyst for increased state, corporate, and foun-dation support for the arts. Congress has recently restricted the availability of federal funding for individual
artists, confining grants primarily to qualifying organiza-tions and state arts agencies, and constraining subgranting.

See Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appro-priations Act, 1998, $ 329, 111 Stat. 1600. By far the largest
portion of the grants distributed in fiscal year 1998 wereawarded directly to state arts agencies. In the remaining
categories, the most substantial grants were allocated to
symphony orchestras, fine arts museums, dance theater foundations, and opera associations. See National Endowment
for the Arts, FY 1998 Grants, Creation & Presentation 5-8,
21, 20, 27.

Throughout the NEA's history, only a handful of the
agency's roughly 100,000 awards have generated formal complaints about misapplied funds or abuse of the public's trust.
Two provocative works, however, prompted public controversy in 1989 and led to congressional revaluation of the
NEA's funding priorities and efforts to increase oversight of
its grant-making procedures. The Institute of Contemporary Art at the University of Pennsylvania had used $30,000
of a visual arts grant it received from the NEA to fund a
1989 retrospective of photographer Robert Mapplethorpe's
work. The exhibit, entitled The Perfect Moment, included
homoerotic photographs that several Members of Congress
condemned as pornographic. See, e. g., 135 Cong. Rec. 22372
(1989). Members also denounced artist Andres Serrano's
work Piss Christ, a photograph of a crucifix immersed in
urine. See, e. g., id., at 9789. Serrano had been awarded a
$15,000 grant from the Southeast Center for Contemporary
Art, an organization that received NEA support.

When considering the NEA's appropriations for fiscal year
1990, Congress reacted to the controversy surrounding the

524US2 Unit: $U95 [09-06-00 18:40:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN

575Cite as: 524 U. S. 569 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
Mapplethorpe and Serrano photographs by eliminating
$45,000 from the agency's budget, the precise amount contributed to the two exhibits by NEA grant recipients. Congress also enacted an amendment providing that no NEA
funds "may be used to promote, disseminate, or produce
materials which in the judgment of [the NEA] may be
considered obscene, including but not limited to, depictions
of sadomasochism, homoeroticism, the sexual exploitation of
children, or individuals engaged in sex acts and which, when
taken as a whole, do not have serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value." Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1990, 103 Stat. 738-742.
The NEA implemented Congress' mandate by instituting a
requirement that all grantees certify in writing that they
would not utilize federal funding to engage in projects inconsistent with the criteria in the 1990 appropriations bill.
That certification requirement was subsequently invalidated
as unconstitutionally vague by a Federal District Court,
see Bella Lewitzky Dance Foundation v. Frohnmayer, 754
F. Supp. 774 (CD Cal. 1991), and the NEA did not appeal
the decision.

In the 1990 appropriations bill, Congress also agreed to
create an Independent Commission of constitutional law
scholars to review the NEA's grant-making procedures and
assess the possibility of more focused standards for public
arts funding. The Commission's report, issued in September 1990, concluded that there is no constitutional obligation
to provide arts funding, but also recommended that the NEA
rescind the certification requirement and cautioned against
legislation setting forth any content restrictions. Instead,
the Commission suggested procedural changes to enhance
the role of advisory panels and a statutory reaffirmation of
"the high place the nation accords to the fostering of mutual
respect for the disparate beliefs and values among us." See

tional Endowment for the Arts 83-91 (Sept. 1990), 3 Record,Doc. No. 51, Exh. K (hereinafter Report to Congress).

Informed by the Commission's recommendations, and cog-nizant of pending judicial challenges to the funding limitations in the 1990 appropriations bill, Congress debated sev-eral proposals to reform the NEA's grant-making process
when it considered the agency's reauthorization in the fallof 1990. The House rejected the Crane Amendment, which
would have virtually eliminated the NEA, see 136 Cong.Rec. 28656-28657 (1990), and the Rohrabacher Amendment,
which would have introduced a prohibition on awarding anygrants that could be used to "promote, distribute, disseminate, or produce matter that has the purpose or effect ofdenigrating the beliefs, tenets, or objects of a particular religion" or "of denigrating an individual, or group of individuals,on the basis of race, sex, handicap, or national origin,"

id.,
at 28657-28664. Ultimately, Congress adopted the Williams/Coleman Amendment, a bipartisan compromise between

Members opposing any funding restrictions and those favoring some guidance to the agency. In relevant part, theAmendment became $ 954(d)(1), which directs the Chairperson, in establishing procedures to judge the artistic meritof grant applications, to "tak[e] into consideration general
standards of decency and respect for the diverse beliefs andvalues of the American public." *

*Title 20 U. S. C. $ 954(d) provides in full that:
"No payment shall be made under this section except upon application
therefor which is submitted to the National Endowment for the Arts in
accordance with regulations issued and procedures established by the
Chairperson. In establishing such regulations and procedures, the Chairperson shall ensure that--

"(1) artistic excellence and artistic merit are the criteria by which applications are judged, taking into consideration general standards of decency
and respect for the diverse beliefs and values of the American public; and

"(2) applications are consistent with the purposes of this section. Such
regulations and procedures shall clearly indicate that obscenity is without
artistic merit, is not protected speech, and shall not be funded."

The four individual respondents in this case, Karen Finley,John Fleck, Holly Hughes, and Tim Miller, are performance

artists who applied for NEA grants before $ 954(d)(1) wasenacted. An advisory panel recommended approval of respondents' projects, both initially and after receiving Frohn-mayer's request to reconsider three of the applications. A
majority of the Council subsequently recommended disap-proval, and in June 1990, the NEA informed respondents
that they had been denied funding. Respondents filed suit,alleging that the NEA had violated their First Amendment
rights by rejecting the applications on political grounds, hadfailed to follow statutory procedures by basing the denial on
criteria other than those set forth in the NEA's enablingstatute, and had breached the confidentiality of their grant
applications through the release of quotations to the press,in violation of the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U. S. C. $ 552(a).
Respondents sought restoration of the recommended grantsor reconsideration of their applications, as well as damages
for the alleged Privacy Act violations. When Congressenacted $ 954(d)(1), respondents, now joined by the National
Association of Artists' Organizations (NAAO), amended

their complaint to challenge the provision as void for vague-ness and impermissibly viewpoint based. First Amended

Complaint || 1.The District Court denied the NEA's motion for judgment
on the pleadings, 795 F. Supp. 1457, 1463-1468 (CD Cal.
1992), and, after discovery, the NEA agreed to settle theindividual respondents' statutory and as-applied constitutional claims by paying the artists the amount of the vetoedgrants, damages, and attorney's fees. See Stipulation and
Settlement Agreement, 6 Record, Doc. No. 128, pp. 3-5.The District Court then granted summary judgment in
favor of respondents on their facial constitutional challenge
to $ 954(d)(1) and enjoined enforcement of the provision.
See 795 F. Supp., at 1476. The court rejected the argument
that the NEA could comply with $ 954(d)(1) by structuring
the grant selection process to provide for diverse advisory
panels. Id., at 1471. The provision, the court stated, "fails
adequately to notify applicants of what is required of them or
to circumscribe NEA discretion." Id., at 1472. Reasoning
that "the very nature of our pluralistic society is that there
are an infinite number of values and beliefs, and correlatively,
there may be no national `general standards of decency,' "
the court concluded that $ 954(d)(1) "cannot be given effect
consistent with the Fifth Amendment's due process requirement." Id., at 1471-1472 (citing Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U. S. 104, 108-109 (1972)). Drawing an analogy between arts funding and public universities, the court further
ruled that the First Amendment constrains the NEA's
grant-making process, and that because $ 954(d)(1) "clearly
reaches a substantial amount of protected speech," it is
impermissibly overbroad on its face. 795 F. Supp., at 1476.
The Government did not seek a stay of the District Court's
injunction, and consequently the NEA has not applied

$ 954(d)(1) since June 1992.

A divided panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's ruling. 100 F. 3d 671 (CA9 1996). The major524US2 Unit: $U95 [09-06-00 18:40:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN

579Cite as: 524 U. S. 569 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
ity agreed with the District Court that the NEA was com-pelled by the adoption of $ 954(d)(1) to alter its grant-making

procedures to ensure that applications are judged accordingto the "decency and respect" criteria. The Chairperson, the
court reasoned, "has no discretion to ignore this obligation,
enforce only part of it, or give it a cramped construction."
Id., at 680. Concluding that the "decency and respect" criteria are not "susceptible to objective definition," the courtheld that $ 954(d)(1) "gives rise to the danger of arbitrary

and discriminatory application" and is void for vaguenessunder the First and Fifth Amendments.

Id., at 680-681.
In the alternative, the court ruled that $ 954(d)(1) violates
the First Amendment's prohibition on viewpoint-based restrictions on protected speech. Government funding of the
arts, the court explained, is both a "traditional sphere of free
expression," Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U. S. 173, 200 (1991), and
an area in which the Government has stated its intention
to "encourage a diversity of views from private speakers,"
Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S.
819, 834 (1995). 100 F. 3d, at 681-682. Accordingly, finding
that $ 954(d)(1) "has a speech-based restriction as its sole rationale and operative principle," Rosenberger, supra, at 834,
and noting the NEA's failure to articulate a compelling interest for the provision, the court declared it facially invalid.
100 F. 3d, at 683.

The dissent asserted that the First Amendment protects
artists' rights to express themselves as indecently and disrespectfully as they like, but does not compel the Government
to fund that speech. Id., at 684 (opinion of Kleinfeld, J.).
The challenged provision, the dissent contended, did not prohibit the NEA from funding indecent or offensive art, but
merely required the agency to consider the "decency and respect" criteria in the grant selection process. Id., at 689-
690. Moreover, according to the dissent's reasoning, the
vagueness principles applicable to the direct regulation of
speech have no bearing on the selective award of prizes, and

Opinion of the Court
the Government may draw distinctions based on content andviewpoint in making its funding decisions. Id., at 684-688.

Three judges dissented from the denial of rehearing en banc,maintaining that the panel's decision gave the statute an "implausible construction," applied the " `void for vagueness'doctrine where it does not belong," and extended "First
Amendment principles to a situation that the First Amend-ment doesn't cover." 112 F. 3d 1015, 1016-1017 (CA9 1997).

We granted certiorari, 522 U. S. 991 (1997), and nowreverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.

A

Respondents raise a facial constitutional challenge to$ 954(d)(1), and consequently they confront "a heavy burden"

in advancing their claim. Rust, supra, at 183. Facial inval-idation "is, manifestly, strong medicine" that "has been employed by the Court sparingly and only as a last resort."
Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U. S. 601, 613 (1973); see alsoFW/PBS, Inc. v. Dallas, 493 U. S. 215, 223 (1990) (noting that

"facial challenges to legislation are generally disfavored").To prevail, respondents must demonstrate a substantial risk
that application of the provision will lead to the suppressionof speech. See

Broadrick, supra, at 615.Respondents argue that the provision is a paradigmatic

example of viewpoint discrimination because it rejects anyartistic speech that either fails to respect mainstream values
or offends standards of decency. The premise of respond-ents' claim is that $ 954(d)(1) constrains the agency's ability
to fund certain categories of artistic expression. The NEA,however, reads the provision as merely hortatory, and contends that it stops well short of an absolute restriction. Sec-tion 954(d)(1) adds "considerations" to the grant-making
process; it does not preclude awards to projects that mightbe deemed "indecent" or "disrespectful," nor place conditions
on grants, or even specify that those factors must be given

Opinion of the Court
any particular weight in reviewing an application. Indeed,the agency asserts that it has adequately implemented

$ 954(d)(1) merely by ensuring the representation of variousbackgrounds and points of view on the advisory panels that
analyze grant applications. See Declaration of Randolph
McAusland, Deputy Chairman for Programs at the NEA, re-printed in App. 79 (stating that the NEA implements the

provision "by ensuring that the peer review panels representa variety of geographical areas, aesthetic views, professions,
areas of expertise, races and ethnic groups, and gender, andinclude a lay person"). We do not decide whether the NEA's
view--that the formulation of diverse advisory panels is sufficient to comply with Congress' command--is in fact a reasonable reading of the statute. It is clear, however, that the
text of $ 954(d)(1) imposes no categorical requirement. The
advisory language stands in sharp contrast to congressional
efforts to prohibit the funding of certain classes of speech.
When Congress has in fact intended to affirmatively constrain the NEA's grant-making authority, it has done so in
no uncertain terms. See $ 954(d)(2) ("[O]bscenity is without
artistic merit, is not protected speech, and shall not be
funded").

Furthermore, like the plain language of $ 954(d), the political context surrounding the adoption of the "decency and respect" clause is inconsistent with respondents' assertion that
the provision compels the NEA to deny funding on the basis
of viewpoint discriminatory criteria. The legislation was a
bipartisan proposal introduced as a counterweight to amendments aimed at eliminating the NEA's funding or substantially constraining its grant-making authority. See, e. g., 136
Cong. Rec. 28626, 28632, 28634 (1990). The Independent
Commission had cautioned Congress against the adoption of
distinct viewpoint-based standards for funding, and the Commission's report suggests that "additional criteria for selection, if any, should be incorporated as part of the selection
process (perhaps as part of a definition of `artistic excel524US2 Unit: $U95 [09-06-00 18:40:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
lence'), rather than isolated and treated as exogenous consid-erations." Report to Congress 89. In keeping with that

recommendation, the criteria in $ 954(d)(1) inform the assess-ment of artistic merit, but Congress declined to disallow any
particular viewpoints. As the sponsors of $ 954(d)(1) noted
in urging rejection of the Rohrabacher Amendment: "[I]f westart down that road of prohibiting categories of expression,

categories which are indeed constitutionally protectedspeech, where do we end? Where one Member's aversions
end, others with different sensibilities and with different val-ues begin." 136 Cong. Rec. 28624 (statement of Rep. Coleman); see also id., at 28663 (statement of Rep. Williams) (arguing that the Rohrabacher Amendment would prevent the
funding of Jasper Johns' flag series, The Merchant of Venice,
Chorus Line, Birth of a Nation, and the Grapes of Wrath).
In contrast, before the vote on $ 954(d)(1), one of its sponsors
stated: "If we have done one important thing in this amendment, it is this. We have maintained the integrity of freedom of expression in the United States." Id., at 28674.

That $ 954(d)(1) admonishes the NEA merely to take "decency and respect" into consideration and that the legislation
was aimed at reforming procedures rather than precluding
speech undercut respondents' argument that the provision
inevitably will be utilized as a tool for invidious viewpoint
discrimination. In cases where we have struck down legislation as facially unconstitutional, the dangers were both
more evident and more substantial. In R. A. V. v. St. Paul,
505 U. S. 377 (1992), for example, we invalidated on its face
a municipal ordinance that defined as a criminal offense the
placement of a symbol on public or private property " `which
one knows or has reasonable grounds to know arouses anger,
alarm or resentment in others on the basis of race, color,
creed, religion or gender.' " See id., at 380. That provision
set forth a clear penalty, proscribed views on particular "disfavored subjects," id., at 391, and suppressed "distinctive
idea[s], conveyed by a distinctive message," id., at 393.

524US2 Unit: $U95 [09-06-00 18:40:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN

583Cite as: 524 U. S. 569 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
In contrast, the "decency and respect" criteria do notsilence speakers by expressly "threaten[ing] censorship of

ideas." See ibid. Thus, we do not perceive a realistic dan-ger that $ 954(d)(1) will compromise First Amendment values. As respondents' own arguments demonstrate, the considerations that the provision introduces, by their nature, donot engender the kind of directed viewpoint discrimination

that would prompt this Court to invalidate a statute on itsface. Respondents assert, for example, that "[o]ne would be
hard-pressed to find two people in the United States whocould agree on what the `diverse beliefs and values of the
American public' are, much less on whether a particular
work of art `respects' them"; and they claim that " `[d]ecency'
is likely to mean something very different to a septegenarian
in Tuscaloosa and a teenager in Las Vegas." Brief for Respondents 41. The NEA likewise views the considerations
enumerated in $ 954(d)(1) as susceptible to multiple interpretations. See Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations for 1992, Hearing before the Subcommittee on Interior and Related Agencies of the House
Committee on Appropriations, 102d Cong., 1st Sess., 234
(1991) (testimony of John Frohnmayer) ("[N]o one individual
is wise enough to be able to consider general standards of
decency and the diverse values and beliefs of the American
people all by him or herself. These are group decisions").
Accordingly, the provision does not introduce considerations
that, in practice, would effectively preclude or punish the
expression of particular views. Indeed, one could hardly
anticipate how "decency" or "respect" would bear on grant

applications in categories such as funding for symphony
orchestras.

Respondents' claim that the provision is facially unconstitutional may be reduced to the argument that the criteria in

$ 954(d)(1) are sufficiently subjective that the agency could
utilize them to engage in viewpoint discrimination. Given
the varied interpretations of the criteria and the vague ex524US2 Unit: $U95 [09-06-00 18:40:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN
584 NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR ARTS v. FINLEY

Opinion of the Court
hortation to "take them into consideration," it seems un-likely that this provision will introduce any greater element

of selectivity than the determination of "artistic excellence"itself. And we are reluctant, in any event, to invalidate legislation "on the basis of its hypothetical application to situations not before the Court." FCC v. Pacifica Foundation,438 U. S. 726, 743 (1978).

The NEA's enabling statute contemplates a number of in-disputably constitutional applications for both the "decency"
prong of $ 954(d)(1) and its reference to "respect for the di-verse beliefs and values of the American public." Educational programs are central to the NEA's mission. See

$ 951(9) ("Americans should receive in school, background
and preparation in the arts and humanities"); $ 954(c)(5) (listing "projects and productions that will encourage public
knowledge, education, understanding, and appreciation of the
arts" among the NEA's funding priorities); National Endowment for the Arts, FY 1999 Application Guidelines 18-19 (describing "Education & Access" category); Brief for Twentysix Arts, Broadcast, Library, Museum and Publishing Amici
Curiae 5, n. 2 (citing NEA Strategic Plan FY 1997-FY 2002,
which identifies children's festivals and museums, art education, at-risk youth projects, and artists in schools as examples of the NEA's activities). And it is well established that
"decency" is a permissible factor where "educational suitability" motivates its consideration. Board of Ed., Island Trees
Union Free School Dist. No. 26 v. Pico, 457 U. S. 853, 871
(1982); see also Bethel School Dist. No. 403 v. Fraser, 478
U. S. 675, 683 (1986) ("Surely it is a highly appropriate function of public school education to prohibit the use of vulgar
and offensive terms in public discourse").

Permissible applications of the mandate to consider "respect for the diverse beliefs and values of the American public" are also apparent. In setting forth the purposes of the
NEA, Congress explained that "[i]t is vital to a democracy
to honor and preserve its multicultural artistic heritage."

524US2 Unit: $U95 [09-06-00 18:40:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court

$ 951(10). The agency expressly takes diversity into account, giving special consideration to "projects and productions . . . that reach, or reflect the culture of, a minority,
inner city, rural, or tribal community," $ 954(c)(4), as well
as projects that generally emphasize "cultural diversity,"

$ 954(c)(1). Respondents do not contend that the criteria in

$ 954(d)(1) are impermissibly applied when they may be justified, as the statute contemplates, with respect to a project's
intended audience.

We recognize, of course, that reference to these permissible applications would not alone be sufficient to sustain the
statute against respondents' First Amendment challenge.
But neither are we persuaded that, in other applications, the
language of $ 954(d)(1) itself will give rise to the suppression
of protected expression. Any content-based considerations
that may be taken into account in the grant-making process
are a consequence of the nature of arts funding. The NEA
has limited resources, and it must deny the majority of the
grant applications that it receives, including many that propose "artistically excellent" projects. The agency may decide to fund particular projects for a wide variety of reasons,
"such as the technical proficiency of the artist, the creativity
of the work, the anticipated public interest in or appreciation
of the work, the work's contemporary relevance, its educational value, its suitability for or appeal to special audiences
(such as children or the disabled), its service to a rural or
isolated community, or even simply that the work could increase public knowledge of an art form." Brief for Petitioners 32. As the dissent below noted, it would be "impossible
to have a highly selective grant program without denying
money to a large amount of constitutionally protected expression." 100 F. 3d, at 685 (opinion of Kleinfeld, J.). The
"very assumption" of the NEA is that grants will be awarded
according to the "artistic worth of competing applicants,"
and absolute neutrality is simply "inconceivable." Advo524US2 Unit: $U95 [09-06-00 18:40:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN

cates for the Arts v. Thomson, 532 F. 2d 792, 795-796 (CA1),cert. denied, 429 U. S. 894 (1976).

Respondents' reliance on our decision in Rosenberger v.
Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. 819 (1995),
is therefore misplaced. In Rosenberger, a public university
declined to authorize disbursements from its Student Activi-ties Fund to finance the printing of a Christian student newspaper. We held that by subsidizing the Student ActivitiesFund, the University had created a limited public forum,
from which it impermissibly excluded all publications withreligious editorial viewpoints.

Id., at 837. Although the
scarcity of NEA funding does not distinguish this case from
Rosenberger, see id., at 835, the competitive process according to which the grants are allocated does. In the context
of arts funding, in contrast to many other subsidies, the Government does not indiscriminately "encourage a diversity of
views from private speakers," id., at 834. The NEA's mandate is to make esthetic judgments, and the inherently
content-based "excellence" threshold for NEA support sets
it apart from the subsidy at issue in Rosenberger--which was
available to all student organizations that were " `related to
the educational purpose of the University,' " id., at 824--and
from comparably objective decisions on allocating public benefits, such as access to a school auditorium or a municipal
theater, see Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free
School Dist., 508 U. S. 384, 386 (1993); Southeastern Promotions, Ltd. v. Conrad, 420 U. S. 546, 555 (1975), or the second
class mailing privileges available to " `all newspapers and
other periodical publications,' " see Hannegan v. Esquire,

Inc., 327 U. S. 146, 148, n. 1 (1946).

Respondents do not allege discrimination in any particular
funding decision. (In fact, after filing suit to challenge

$ 954(d)(1), two of the individual respondents received NEA
grants. See 4 Record, Doc. No. 57, Exh. 35 (Sept. 30, 1991,

Miller that they had been awarded Solo Performance The524US2 Unit: $U95 [09-06-00 18:40:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
ater Artist Fellowships).) Thus, we have no occasion hereto address an as-applied challenge in a situation where the

denial of a grant may be shown to be the product of invidiousviewpoint discrimination. If the NEA were to leverage its
power to award subsidies on the basis of subjective criteriainto a penalty on disfavored viewpoints, then we would confront a different case. We have stated that, even in the pro-vision of subsidies, the Government may not "ai[m] at the
suppression of dangerous ideas," Regan v. Taxation with
Representation of Wash., 461 U. S. 540, 550 (1983) (internalquotation marks omitted), and if a subsidy were "manipulated" to have a "coercive effect," then relief could be appro-priate. See

Arkansas Writers' Project, Inc. v. Ragland, 481U. S. 221, 237 (1987) (

Scalia, J., dissenting); see also Leathers v. Medlock, 499 U. S. 439, 447 (1991) ("[D]ifferential taxa-tion of First Amendment speakers is constitutionally suspect

when it threatens to suppress the expression of particularideas or viewpoints"). In addition, as the NEA itself concedes, a more pressing constitutional question would arise ifGovernment funding resulted in the imposition of a disproportionate burden calculated to drive "certain ideas or view-points from the marketplace."

Simon & Schuster, Inc. v.Members of N. Y. State Crime Victims Bd., 502 U. S. 105,

116 (1991); see Brief for Petitioners 38, n. 12. Unless$ 954(d)(1) is applied in a manner that raises concern about
the suppression of disfavored viewpoints, however, we up-hold the constitutionality of the provision. Cf.

Red LionBroadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U. S. 367, 396 (1969) ("[W]e

will not now pass upon the constitutionality of these regula-tions by envisioning the most extreme applications conceivable, but will deal with those problems if and when theyarise" (citation omitted)).

B
Finally, although the First Amendment certainly has ap-plication in the subsidy context, we note that the Government may allocate competitive funding according to criteria

524US2 Unit: $U95 [09-06-00 18:40:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN
588 NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR ARTS v. FINLEY

Opinion of the Court
that would be impermissible were direct regulation of speechor a criminal penalty at stake. So long as legislation does

not infringe on other constitutionally protected rights, Con-gress has wide latitude to set spending priorities. See
Regan, supra, at 549. In the 1990 amendments that incor-porated $ 954(d)(1), Congress modified the declaration of purpose in the NEA's enabling Act to provide that arts fundingshould "contribute to public support and confidence in the
use of taxpayer funds," and that "[p]ublic funds . . . mustultimately serve public purposes the Congress defines."

$ 951(5). And as we held in Rust, Congress may "selectivelyfund a program to encourage certain activities it believes to
be in the public interest, without at the same time fundingan alternative program which seeks to deal with the problem
in another way." 500 U. S., at 193. In doing so, "the Gov-ernment has not discriminated on the basis of viewpoint; it
has merely chosen to fund one activity to the exclusion ofthe other." Ibid.; see also Maher v. Roe, 432 U. S. 464, 475
(1977) ("There is a basic difference between direct stateinterference with a protected activity and state encouragement of an alternative activity consonant with legislativepolicy").

III
The lower courts also erred in invalidating $ 954(d)(1)as unconstitutionally vague. Under the First and Fifth

Amendments, speakers are protected from arbitrary and dis-criminatory enforcement of vague standards. See

NAACP
v. Button, 371 U. S. 415, 432-433 (1963). The terms of theprovision are undeniably opaque, and if they appeared in a

criminal statute or regulatory scheme, they could raise substantial vagueness concerns. It is unlikely, however, thatspeakers will be compelled to steer too far clear of any "forbidden area" in the context of grants of this nature. Cf.
Board of Airport Comm'rs of Los Angeles v. Jews for Jesus,
Inc., 482 U. S. 569, 574 (1987) (facially invalidating a flat ban

524US2 Unit: $U95 [09-06-00 18:40:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN

on any "First Amendment" activities in an airport); Hoffman
Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U. S. 489, 499
(1982) ("prohibitory and stigmatizing effect" of a "quasicriminal" ordinance relevant to the vagueness analysis);
Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U. S., at 108 (requiring
clear lines between "lawful and unlawful" conduct). We recognize, as a practical matter, that artists may conform their
speech to what they believe to be the decisionmaking criteria
in order to acquire funding. See Statement of Charlotte
Murphy, Executive Director of NAAO, reprinted in App. 21-
22. But when the Government is acting as patron rather
than as sovereign, the consequences of imprecision are not
constitutionally severe.

In the context of selective subsidies, it is not always feasible for Congress to legislate with clarity. Indeed, if this
statute is unconstitutionally vague, then so too are all Government programs awarding scholarships and grants on the
basis of subjective criteria such as "excellence." See, e. g.,
2 U. S. C. $ 802 (establishing the Congressional Award Program to "promote initiative, achievement, and excellence
among youths in the areas of public service, personal development, and physical and expedition fitness"); 20 U. S. C.

$ 956(c)(1) (providing funding to the National Endowment for
the Humanities to promote "progress and scholarship in the
humanities"); $ 1134h(a) (authorizing the Secretary of Education to award fellowships to "students of superior ability selected on the basis of demonstrated achievement and exceptional promise"); 22 U. S. C. $ 2452(a) (authorizing the award
of Fulbright grants to "strengthen international cooperative
relations"); 42 U. S. C. $ 7382c (authorizing the Secretary of
Energy to recognize teachers for "excellence in mathematics
or science education"). To accept respondents' vagueness
argument would be to call into question the constitutionality
of these valuable Government programs and countless others
like them.

Scalia, J., concurring in judgment
Section 954(d)(1) merely adds some imprecise considera-tions to an already subjective selection process. It does not,

on its face, impermissibly infringe on First or Fifth Amend-ment rights. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of
Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further

proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Thomas joins,
concurring in the judgment.

"The operation was a success, but the patient died."
What such a procedure is to medicine, the Court's opinion inthis case is to law. It sustains the constitutionality of 20

U. S. C. $ 954(d)(1) by gutting it. The most avid congressional opponents of the provision could not have asked formore. I write separately because, unlike the Court, I think

that $ 954(d)(1) must be evaluated as written, rather than asdistorted by the agency it was meant to control. By its
terms, it establishes content- and viewpoint-based criteriaupon which grant applications are to be evaluated. And
that is perfectly constitutional.

I
The Statute Means What It Says

Section 954(d)(1) provides:

"No payment shall be made under this section except
upon application therefor which is submitted to theNational Endowment for the Arts in accordance with

regulations issued and procedures established by theChairperson. In establishing such regulations and procedures, the Chairperson shall ensure that--"(1) artistic excellence and artistic merit are the criteria by which applications are judged, taking into consid-eration general standards of decency and respect for the
diverse beliefs and values of the American public."

The phrase "taking into consideration general standards ofdecency and respect for the diverse beliefs and values of the

American public" is what my grammar-school teacher wouldhave condemned as a dangling modifier: There is no noun
to which the participle is attached (unless one jumps out of
paragraph (1) to press "Chairperson" into service). Even so,it is clear enough that the phrase is meant to apply to those

who do the judging. The application reviewers must takeinto account "general standards of decency" and "respect for
the diverse beliefs and values of the American public" whenevaluating artistic excellence and merit. One can regard
this as either suggesting that decency and respect are elements of what Congress regards as artistic excellence and
merit, or as suggesting that decency and respect are factors
to be taken into account in addition to artistic excellence
and merit. But either way, it is entirely, 100% clear that
decency and respect are to be taken into account in evaluating applications.

This is so apparent that I am at a loss to understand what
the Court has in mind (other than the gutting of the statute)
when it speculates that the statute is merely "advisory."
Ante, at 581. General standards of decency and respect for
Americans' beliefs and values must (for the statute says that
the Chairperson "shall ensure" this result) be taken into account, see, e. g., American Heritage Dictionary 402 (3d ed.
1992) ("consider . . . [t]o take into account; bear in mind"), in
evaluating all applications. This does not mean that those
factors must always be dispositive, but it does mean that
they must always be considered. The method of compliance
proposed by the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA)--
selecting diverse review panels of artists and nonartists that
reflect a wide range of geographic and cultural perspectives--is so obviously inadequate that it insults the intelligence. A diverse panel membership increases the odds that,
if and when the panel takes the factors into account, it will
reach an accurate assessment of what they demand. But it

Scalia, J., concurring in judgment
in no way increases the odds that the panel will take the
factors into consideration--much less ensures that the panel
will do so, which is the Chairperson's duty under the statute.
Moreover, the NEA's fanciful reading of $ 954(d)(1) would
make it wholly superfluous. Section 959(c) already requires
the Chairperson to "issue regulations and establish procedures . . . to ensure that all panels are composed, to the
extent practicable, of individuals reflecting . . . diverse artistic and cultural points of view."

The statute requires the decency and respect factors to be
considered in evaluating all applications--not, for example,
just those applications relating to educational programs,
ante, at 584, or intended for a particular audience, ante, at
585. Just as it would violate the statute to apply the artistic
excellence and merit requirements to only select categories
of applications, it would violate the statute to apply the decency and respect factors less than universally. A reviewer
may, of course, give varying weight to the factors depending
on the context, and in some categories of cases (such as the
Court's example of funding for symphony orchestras, ante,
at 583) the factors may rarely if ever affect the outcome; but

$ 954(d)(1) requires the factors to be considered in every case.

I agree with the Court that $ 954(d)(1) "imposes no categorical requirement," ante, at 581, in the sense that it
does not require the denial of all applications that violate
general standards of decency or exhibit disrespect for the
diverse beliefs and values of Americans. Cf. $ 954(d)(2)
("[O]bscenity . . . shall not be funded"). But the factors need
not be conclusive to be discriminatory. To the extent a particular applicant exhibits disrespect for the diverse beliefs
and values of the American public or fails to comport with
general standards of decency, the likelihood that he will receive a grant diminishes. In other words, the presence of
the "tak[e] into consideration" clause "cannot be regarded as
mere surplusage; it means something," Potter v. United

States, 155 U. S. 438, 446 (1894). And the "something" isthat the decisionmaker, all else being equal, will favor applications that display decency and respect, and disfavor appli-cations that do not.

This unquestionably constitutes viewpoint discrimination.1That conclusion is not altered by the fact that the statute
does not "compe[l]" the denial of funding, ante, at 581, any
more than a provision imposing a five-point handicap on allblack applicants for civil service jobs is saved from being

race discrimination by the fact that it does not compel therejection of black applicants. If viewpoint discrimination in
this context is unconstitutional (a point I shall address anon),the law is invalid unless there are some situations in which
the decency and respect factors do not constitute viewpoint
discrimination. And there is none. The applicant who
displays "decency," that is, "[c]onformity to prevailing standards of propriety or modesty," American Heritage Diction-ary, at 483 (def. 2), and the applicant who displays "respect,"

that is, "deferential regard," for the diverse beliefs and val-ues of the American people,

id., at 1536 (def. 1), will always
have an edge over an applicant who displays the opposite.And finally, the conclusion of viewpoint discrimination is

not affected by the fact that what constitutes " `decency' "or " `the diverse values and beliefs of the American people' "
is difficult to pin down, ante, at 583--any more than a
civil service preference in favor of those who display"Republican-Party values" would be rendered nondiscriminatory by the fact that there is plenty of room for argument
as to what Republican-Party values might be.

1 If there is any uncertainty on the point, it relates only to the adjective,
which is not at issue in the current discussion. That is, one might argue
that the decency and respect factors constitute content discrimination
rather than viewpoint discrimination, which would render them easier to
uphold. Since I believe this statute must be upheld in either event, I pass
over this conundrum and assume the worst.

594 NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR ARTS v. FINLEY

Scalia, J., concurring in judgment
The "political context surrounding the adoption of the
`decency and respect' clause," which the Court discusses
at some length, ante, at 581, does not change its meaning or
affect its constitutionality. All that is proved by the various
statements that the Court quotes from the Report of the
Independent Commission and the floor debates is (1) that the
provision was not meant categorically to exclude any particular viewpoint (which I have conceded, and which is plain
from the text), and (2) that the language was not meant to
do anything that is unconstitutional. That in no way propels
the Court's leap to the countertextual conclusion that the
provision was merely "aimed at reforming procedures," and
cannot be "utilized as a tool for invidious viewpoint discrimination," ante, at 582. It is evident in the legislative history
that $ 954(d)(1) was prompted by, and directed at, the public
funding of such offensive productions as Serrano's "Piss
Christ," the portrayal of a crucifix immersed in urine, and
Mapplethorpe's show of lurid homoerotic photographs.
Thus, even if one strays beyond the plain text it is perfectly
clear that the statute was meant to disfavor--that is, to
discriminate against--such productions. Not to ban their

funding absolutely, to be sure (though as I shall discuss, that
also would not have been unconstitutional), but to make their
funding more difficult.

More fundamentally, of course, all this legislative history
has no valid claim upon our attention at all. It is a virtual
certainty that very few of the Members of Congress who
voted for this language both (1) knew of, and (2) agreed with,
the various statements that the Court has culled from the
Report of the Independent Commission and the floor debate
(probably conducted on an almost empty floor). And it is
wholly irrelevant that the statute was a "bipartisan proposal
introduced as a counterweight" to an alternative proposal
that would directly restrict funding on the basis of viewpoint. See ante, at 581-582. We do not judge statutes as

if we are surveying the scene of an accident; each one isreviewed, not on the basis of how much worse it could have

been, but on the basis of what it says. See United Statesv. Estate of Romani, 523 U. S. 519, 535 (1998) (

Scalia, J.,concurring in part and concurring in judgment). It matters

not whether this enactment was the product of the most par-tisan alignment in history or whether, upon its passage, the
Members all linked arms and sang, "The more we get to-gether, the happier we'll be." It is "not consonant with our
scheme of government for a court to inquire into the motivesof legislators." Tenney v. Brandhove, 341 U. S. 367, 377
(1951). The law at issue in this case is to be found in thetext of $ 954(d)(1), which passed both Houses and was signed
by the President, U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 7. And that lawunquestionably disfavors--discriminates against--indecency
and disrespect for the diverse beliefs and values of theAmerican people. I turn, then, to whether such viewpoint
discrimination violates the Constitution.

II
What The Statute Says Is Constitutional
The Court devotes so much of its opinion to explainingwhy this statute means something other than what it says

that it neglects to cite the constitutional text governing ouranalysis. The First Amendment reads: "Congress shall
make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech." U. S.Const., Amdt. 1 (emphasis added). To abridge is "to contract, to diminish; to deprive of." T. Sheridan, A CompleteDictionary of the English Language (6th ed. 1796). With
the enactment of $ 954(d)(1), Congress did not abridge thespeech of those who disdain the beliefs and values of the
American public, nor did it abridge indecent speech. Thosewho wish to create indecent and disrespectful art are as unconstrained now as they were before the enactment of thisstatute.

Avant-garde artistes such as respondents remain

entirely free to e'pater les bourgeois; 2 they are merely de-prived of the additional satisfaction of having the bourgeoisie

taxed to pay for it. It is preposterous to equate the denialof taxpayer subsidy with measures " ` "aimed at the suppression of dangerous ideas." ' " Regan v. Taxation with Representation of Wash., 461 U. S. 540, 550 (1983) (emphasisadded) (quoting Cammarano v. United States, 358 U. S. 498,

513 (1959), in turn quoting Speiser v. Randall, 357 U. S. 513,519 (1958)). "The reason that denial of participation in a
tax exemption or other subsidy scheme does not necessarily`infringe' a fundamental right is that--unlike direct restriction or prohibition--such a denial does not, as a general rule,have any significant coercive effect."

Arkansas Writers'Project, Inc. v. Ragland, 481 U. S. 221, 237 (1987) (

Scalia,J., dissenting).

One might contend, I suppose, that a threat of rejectionby the only available source of free money would constitute
coercion and hence "abridgment" within the meaning of theFirst Amendment. Cf.

Norwood v. Harrison, 413 U. S. 455,465 (1973). I would not agree with such a contention, which

would make the NEA the mandatory patron of all art too

2 Which they do quite well. The oeuvres d'art for which the four individual plaintiffs in this case sought funding have been described as follows:

"Finley's controversial show, `We Keep Our Victims Ready,' contains
three segments. In the second segment, Finley visually recounts a sexual
assault by stripping to the waist and smearing chocolate on her breasts
and by using profanity to describe the assault. Holly Hughes' monologue
`World Without End' is a somewhat graphic recollection of the artist's realization of her lesbianism and reminiscence of her mother's sexuality. John
Fleck, in his stage performance `Blessed Are All the Little Fishes,' confronts alcoholism and Catholicism. During the course of the performance,
Fleck appears dressed as a mermaid, urinates on the stage and creates
an altar out of a toilet bowl by putting a photograph of Jesus Christ on
the lid. Tim Miller derives his performance `Some Golden States' from
childhood experiences, from his life as a homosexual, and from the constant threat of AIDS. Miller uses vegetables in his performances to represent sexual symbols." Note, 48 Wash. & Lee L. Rev. 1545, 1546, n. 2
(1991) (citations omitted).

indecent, too disrespectful, or even too kitsch to attract pri-vate support. But even if one accepts the contention, it

would have no application here. The NEA is far from thesole source of funding for art--even indecent, disrespectful,
or just plain bad art. Accordingly, the Government may
earmark NEA funds for projects it deems to be in the publicinterest without thereby abridging speech.

Regan v. Taxation with Representation of Wash., supra, at 549.Section 954(d)(1) is no more discriminatory, and no less

constitutional, than virtually every other piece of fundinglegislation enacted by Congress. "The Government can,
without violating the Constitution, selectively fund a program to encourage certain activities it believes to be in the
public interest, without at the same time funding an alternative program . . . ." Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U. S. 173, 193
(1991). As we noted in Rust, when Congress chose to establish the National Endowment for Democracy it was not constitutionally required to fund programs encouraging competing philosophies of government--an example of funding
discrimination that cuts much closer than this one to the core
of political speech which is the primary concern of the First
Amendment. See id., at 194. It takes a particularly high
degree of chutzpah for the NEA to contradict this proposition, since the agency itself discriminates--and is required
by law to discriminate--in favor of artistic (as opposed to
scientific, or political, or theological) expression. Not all the
common folk, or even all great minds, for that matter, think
that is a good idea. In 1800, when John Marshall told John
Adams that a recent immigration of Frenchmen would include talented artists, "Adams denounced all Frenchmen, but
most especially `schoolmasters, painters, poets, &C.' He
warned Marshall that the fine arts were like germs that infected healthy constitutions." J. Ellis, After the Revolution:
Profiles of Early American Culture 36 (1979). Surely the
NEA itself is nothing less than an institutionalized discrimination against that point of view. Nonetheless, it is consti524US2 Unit: $U95 [09-06-00 18:40:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Scalia, J., concurring in judgment
tutional, as is the congressional determination to favor de-cency and respect for beliefs and values over the opposite

because such favoritism does not "abridge" anyone's freedomof speech.

Respondents, relying on Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. 819, 833 (1995), argue thatviewpoint-based discrimination is impermissible unless the

government is the speaker or the government is "disburs-[ing] public funds to private entities to convey a governmental message." Ibid. It is impossible to imagine why thatshould be so; one would think that directly involving the government itself in the viewpoint discrimination (if it is unconstitutional) would make the situation even worse. Respond-ents are mistaken. It is the very business of government to

favor and disfavor points of view on (in modern times, atleast) innumerable subjects--which is the main reason we
have decided to elect those who run the government, ratherthan save money by making their posts hereditary. And it
makes not a bit of difference, insofar as either common senseor the Constitution is concerned, whether these officials further their (and, in a democracy, our) favored point of view
by achieving it directly (having government-employed art-ists paint pictures, for example, or government-employed

doctors perform abortions); or by advocating it officially (es-tablishing an Office of Art Appreciation, for example, or an
Office of Voluntary Population Control); or by giving moneyto others who achieve or advocate it (funding private art
classes, for example, or Planned Parenthood).3 None of thishas anything to do with abridging anyone's speech.

Rosenberger, as the Court explains, ante, at 586, found the view3 I suppose it would be unconstitutional for the government to give
money to an organization devoted to the promotion of candidates nominated by the Republican Party--but it would be just as unconstitutional
for the government itself to promote candidates nominated by the Republican Party, and I do not think that that unconstitutionality has anything
to do with the First Amendment.

Scalia, J., concurring in judgment
point discrimination unconstitutional, not because funding of"private" speech was involved, but because the government

had established a limited public forum--to which the NEA'sgranting of highly selective (if not highly discriminating)
awards bears no resemblance.

The nub of the difference between me and the Court isthat I regard the distinction between "abridging" speech and

funding it as a fundamental divide, on this side of which theFirst Amendment is inapplicable. The Court, by contrast,
seems to believe that the First Amendment, despite itswords, has some ineffable effect upon funding, imposing
constraints of an indeterminate nature which it announces
(without troubling to enunciate any particular test) are not
violated by the statute here--or, more accurately, are not
violated by the quite different, emasculated statute that
it imagines. "[T]he Government," it says, "may allocate
competitive funding according to criteria that would be impermissible were direct regulation of speech or a criminal
penalty at stake," ante, at 587-588. The Government, I
think, may allocate both competitive and noncompetitive
funding ad libitum, insofar as the First Amendment is
concerned.

Finally, what is true of the First Amendment is also true
of the constitutional rule against vague legislation: it has no
application to funding. Insofar as it bears upon First
Amendment concerns, the vagueness doctrine addresses the
problems that arise from government regulation of expressive conduct, see Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U. S. 104,
108-109 (1972), not government grant programs. In the former context, vagueness produces an abridgment of lawful
speech; in the latter it produces, at worst, a waste of money.
I cannot refrain from observing, however, that if the vagueness doctrine were applicable, the agency charged with making grants under a statutory standard of "artistic excellence"--and which has itself thought that standard met by
everything from the playing of Beethoven to a depiction of

a crucifix immersed in urine--would be of more dubious con-stitutional validity than the "decency" and "respect" limitations that respondents (who demand to be judged onthe same strict standard of "artistic excellence") have the
humorlessness to call too vague.

* * *
In its laudatory description of the accomplishments of theNEA, ante, at 574, the Court notes with satisfaction that

"only a handful of the agency's roughly 100,000 awards havegenerated formal complaints," ibid. The Congress that felt
it necessary to enact $ 954(d)(1) evidently thought it muchmore noteworthy that any money exacted from American
taxpayers had been used to produce a crucifix immersed inurine or a display of homoerotic photographs. It is no secret
that the provision was prompted by, and directed at, thefunding of such offensive productions. Instead of banning
the funding of such productions absolutely, which I thinkwould have been entirely constitutional, Congress took the
lesser step of requiring them to be disfavored in the evalua-tion of grant applications. The Court's opinion today renders even that lesser step a nullity. For that reason, I con-cur only in the judgment.

Justice Souter, dissenting.
The question here is whether the italicized segment of thisstatute is unconstitutional on its face: "[A]rtistic excellence

and artistic merit are the criteria by which applications [forgrants from the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA)]
are judged, taking into consideration general standards of
decency and respect for the diverse beliefs and values of theAmerican public." 20 U. S. C. $ 954(d) (emphasis added).

It is.The decency and respect proviso mandates viewpointbased decisions in the disbursement of Government subsi-dies, and the Government has wholly failed to explain why
the statute should be afforded an exemption from the funda524US2 Unit: $U95 [09-06-00 18:40:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Souter, J., dissenting
mental rule of the First Amendment that viewpoint discrimination in the exercise of public authority over expressive activity is unconstitutional. The Court's conclusions that the
proviso is not viewpoint based, that it is not a regulation, and
that the NEA may permissibly engage in viewpoint-based
discrimination, are all patently mistaken. Nor may the
question raised be answered in the Government's favor on
the assumption that some constitutional applications of the
statute are enough to satisfy the demand of facial constitutionality, leaving claims of the proviso's obvious invalidity
to be dealt with later in response to challenges of specific
applications of the discriminatory standards. This assumption is irreconcilable with our longstanding and sensible
doctrine of facial overbreadth, applicable to claims brought
under the First Amendment's speech clause. I respectfully
dissent.

I

"If there is a bedrock principle underlying the First
Amendment, it is that the government may not prohibit the
expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea
itself offensive or disagreeable." Texas v. Johnson, 491 U. S.
397, 414 (1989). "[A]bove all else, the First Amendment
means that government has no power to restrict expression
because of its message [or] its ideas," Police Dept. of Chicago
v. Mosley, 408 U. S. 92, 95 (1972), which is to say that "[t]he
principle of viewpoint neutrality . . . underlies the First
Amendment," Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of United
States, Inc., 466 U. S. 485, 505 (1984). Because this principle
applies not only to affirmative suppression of speech, but also
to disqualification for government favors, Congress is generally not permitted to pivot discrimination against otherwise
protected speech on the offensiveness or unacceptability of
the views it expresses. See, e. g., Rosenberger v. Rector and
Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. 819 (1995) (public university's student activities funds may not be disbursed on

basis of viewpoint); Leathers v. Medlock, 499 U. S. 439, 447(1991) ("[D]ifferential taxation of First Amendment speakers

to regulate speech in ways that favor some viewpoints orideas at the expense of others").

It goes without saying that artistic expression lies withinthis First Amendment protection. See,

e. g., Hurley v.Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc., 515 U. S. 557, 569 (1995) (remarking that exam-ples of painting, music, and poetry are "unquestionably
shielded"); Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U. S. 781, 790(1989) ("Music, as a form of expression and communication,
is protected under the First Amendment"); Schad v. Mount

programs broadcast by radio and television, and live enter-tainment, such as musical and dramatic works, fall within
the First Amendment guarantee"); Kaplan v. California,413 U. S. 115, 119-120 (1973) ("[P]ictures, films, paintings,
drawings, and engravings . . . have First Amendment protec-tion"). The constitutional protection of artistic works turns
not on the political significance that may be attributable tosuch productions, though they may indeed comment on the
political,1 but simply on their expressive character, which

1 Art "may affect public attitudes and behavior in a variety of ways,
ranging from direct espousal of a political or social doctrine to the subtle
shaping of thought which characterizes all artistic expression." Joseph

falls within a spectrum of protected "speech" extendingoutward from the core of overtly political declarations. Put

differently, art is entitled to full protection because our"cultural life," just like our native politics, "rest[s] upon
[the] ideal" of governmental viewpoint neutrality. Turner
Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U. S. 622, 641 (1994).When called upon to vindicate this ideal, we characteristically begin by asking "whether the government has adopteda regulation of speech because of disagreement with the message it conveys. The government's purpose is the control-ling consideration."

Ward v. Rock Against Racism, supra,
at 791 (citation omitted). The answer in this case is damn-ing. One need do nothing more than read the text of the

statute to conclude that Congress's purpose in imposing the
decency and respect criteria was to prevent the funding ofart that conveys an offensive message; the decency and

respect provision on its face is quintessentially viewpoint
based, and quotations from the Congressional Record merely
confirm the obvious legislative purpose. In the words of a
cosponsor of the bill that enacted the proviso, "[w]orks which
deeply offend the sensibilities of significant portions of the
public ought not to be supported with public funds." 136
Cong. Rec. 28624 (1990).2 Another supporter of the bill observed that "the Endowment's support for artists like Robert Mapplethorpe and Andre[s] Serrano has offended and angered many citizens," behooving "Congress . . . to listen to
these complaints about the NEA and make sure that exhibits
like [these] are not funded again." Id., at 28642. Indeed, if
there were any question at all about what Congress had in

2 There is, of course, nothing whatsoever unconstitutional about this
view as a general matter. Congress has no obligation to support artistic
enterprises that many people detest. The First Amendment speaks up
only when Congress decides to participate in the Nation's artistic life by
legal regulation, as it does through a subsidy scheme like the NEA. If
Congress does choose to spend public funds in this manner, it may not
discriminate by viewpoint in deciding who gets the money.

mind, a definitive answer comes in the succinctly accurateremark of the proviso's author, that the bill "add[s] to the

criteria of artistic excellence and artistic merit, a shell, ascreen, a viewpoint that must be constantly taken into account." Id., at 28631.3 II

In the face of such clear legislative purpose, so plainly ex-pressed, the Court has its work cut out for it in seeking a
3 On the subject of legislative history and purpose, it is disturbing that
the Court upholds $ 954(d) in part because the statute was drafted in hope
of avoiding constitutional objections, with some Members of Congress proclaiming its constitutionality on the congressional floor. See ante, at 581-
582. Like the Court, I assume that many Members of Congress believed
the bill to be constitutional. Indeed, Members of Congress must take an
oath or affirmation to support the Constitution, see U. S. Const., Art. VI,
cl. 3, and we should presume in every case that Congress believed its
statute to be consistent with the constitutional commands, see, e. g.,
United States v. X-Citement Video, Inc., 513 U. S. 64, 73 (1994) ("[W]e do
not impute to Congress an intent to pass legislation that is inconsistent
with the Constitution"); Yates v. United States, 354 U. S. 298, 319 (1957).
But courts cannot allow a legislature's conclusory belief in constitutionality, however sincere, to trump incontrovertible unconstitutionality, for "[i]t
is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say
what the law is." Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803).

I recognize, as the court explains, ante, at 581, that the amendment
adding the decency and respect proviso was a bipartisan counterweight to
more severe alternatives, and that some Members of Congress may have
voted for it simply because it seemed the least among various evils. See,
e. g., 136 Cong. Rec. 28670 (1990) ("I am not happy with all aspects of the
Williams-Coleman substitute . . . . It . . . contains language concerning
standards of decency that I find very troubling. But I applaud Mr. Williams for his efforts in achieving this compromise under very difficult
circumstances . . . . I support the Williams-Coleman substitute"). Perhaps the proviso was the mildest alternative available, but that simply
proves that the bipartisan push to reauthorize the NEA could succeed
only by including at least some viewpoint-based limitations. An appreciation of alternatives does not alter the fact that Congress passed decency
and respect restrictions, and it did so knowing and intending that those
restrictions would prevent future controversies stemming from the NEA's
funding of inflammatory art projects, by declaring the inflammatory to be
disfavored for funding.

constitutional reading of the statute. See Edward J. DeBar-tolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast Building & Constr. Trades

Council, 485 U. S. 568, 575 (1988).

A
The Court says, first, that because the phrase "generalstandards of decency and respect for the diverse beliefs and

values of the American public" is imprecise and capable ofmultiple interpretations, "the considerations that the provision introduces, by their nature, do not engender the kindof directed viewpoint discrimination that would prompt this
Court to invalidate a statute on its face." Ante, at 583.Unquestioned case law, however, is clearly to the contrary.

"Sexual expression which is indecent but not obscene isprotected by the First Amendment," Sable Communications of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U. S. 115, 126 (1989), and ex-cept when protecting children from exposure to indecent material, see FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U. S. 726 (1978),the First Amendment has never been read to allow the government to rove around imposing general standards of de-cency, see,

e. g., Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union,521 U. S. 844 (1997) (striking down on its face a statute that

regulated "indecency" on the Internet). Because "the nor-mal definition of `indecent' . . . refers to nonconformance with
accepted standards of morality," FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, supra, at 740, restrictions turning on decency, espe-cially those couched in terms of "general standards of decency," are quintessentially viewpoint based: they requirediscrimination on the basis of conformity with mainstream
mores. The Government's contrary suggestion that theNEA's decency standards restrict only the "form, mode, or
style" of artistic expression, not the underlying viewpointor message, Brief for Petitioners 39-41, may be a tempting
abstraction (and one not lacking in support, cf. Bolger v.
Youngs Drug Products Corp., 463 U. S. 60, 83-84 (1983)(

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment)). But here it sufficesto realize that "form, mode, or style" are not subject to ab524US2 Unit: $U95 [09-06-00 18:40:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN

straction from artistic viewpoint, and to quote from an opin-ion just two years old: "In artistic . . . settings, indecency

may have strong communicative content, protesting conven-tional norms or giving an edge to a work by conveying otherwise inexpressible emotions. . . . Indecency often is inseparable from the ideas and viewpoints conveyed, or separableonly with loss of truth or expressive power."

Denver Area
Ed. Telecommunications Consortium, Inc. v. FCC, 518 U. S.727, 805 (1996) (

Kennedy, J., joined by Ginsburg, J., concurring) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); seealso

Cohen v. California, 403 U. S. 15, 26 (1971) ("[W]e
cannot indulge the facile assumption that one can forbid particular words without also running a substantial risk of
suppressing ideas in the process"). "[T]he inextricability of
indecency from expression," Denver Area Ed. Telecommunications Consortium, supra, at 805, is beyond dispute in a
certain amount of entirely lawful artistic enterprise. Starve
the mode, starve the message.

Just as self-evidently, a statute disfavoring speech that
fails to respect America's "diverse beliefs and values" is the
very model of viewpoint discrimination; it penalizes any view
disrespectful to any belief or value espoused by someone in
the American populace. Boiled down to its practical essence, the limitation obviously means that art that disrespects the ideology, opinions, or convictions of a significant
segment of the American public is to be disfavored, whereas
art that reinforces those values is not. After all, the whole
point of the proviso was to make sure that works like Serrano's ostensibly blasphemous portrayal of Jesus would not
be funded, see supra, at 603, while a reverent treatment,
conventionally respectful of Christian sensibilities, would not
run afoul of the law. Nothing could be more viewpoint
based than that. Cf. Rosenberger, 515 U. S., at 831 (a statute targeting a "prohibited perspective, not the general subject matter" of religion is viewpoint based); United States v.
Eichman, 496 U. S. 310, 317 (1990) (striking down anti-flag524US2 Unit: $U95 [09-06-00 18:40:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Souter, J., dissenting
burning statute because it impermissibly prohibited speechthat was "disrespectful" of the flag). The fact that the statute disfavors art insufficiently respectful of America's "di-verse" beliefs and values alters this conclusion not one whit:
the First Amendment does not validate the ambition to dis-qualify many disrespectful viewpoints instead of merely one.
See Rosenberger, supra, at 831-832.

B
Another alternative for avoiding unconstitutionality thatthe Court appears to regard with some favor is the Government's argument that the NEA may comply with $ 954(d)merely by populating the advisory panels that analyze grant
applications with members of diverse backgrounds. Seeante, at 577, 581. Would that it were so easy; this asserted
implementation of the law fails even to "reflec[t] a plausibleconstruction of the plain language of the statute."

Rust v.Sullivan, 500 U. S. 173, 184 (1991).

The Government notes that $ 954(d) actually provides that"[i]n establishing . . . regulations and procedures, the Chairperson [of the NEA] shall ensure that (1) artistic excellenceand artistic merit are the criteria by which applications are
judged, taking into consideration general standards of de-cency and respect for the diverse beliefs and values of the
American public." According to the Government, this lan-guage requires decency and respect to be considered not in
judging applications, but in making regulations. If, then,the Chairperson takes decency and respect into consideration through regulations ensuring diverse panels, the stat-ute is satisfied. But it would take a great act of will to find
any plausibility in this reading. The reference to consider-ing decency and respect occurs in the subparagraph speaking
to the "criteria by which applications are judged," not in thepreamble directing the Chairperson to adopt regulations; it
is in judging applications that decency and respect are mostobviously to be considered. It is no surprise, then, that the

524US2 Unit: $U95 [09-06-00 18:40:45] PAGES PGT: OPIN
608 NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR ARTS v. FINLEY

Souter, J., dissenting
Government's reading is directly contradicted by the legisla-tive history. According to the provision's author, the decency and respect proviso "mandates that in the awarding offunds, in the award process itself, general standards of decency must be accorded." 136 Cong. Rec. 28672 (1990). Or,
as the cosponsor of the bill put it, "the decisions of artisticexcellence must take into consideration general standards of

decency and respect for the diverse beliefs and values of theAmerican public."

Id., at 28624.
The Government offers a variant of this argument in sug-gesting that even if the NEA must take decency and respect

into account in the active review of applications, it may satisfy the statute by doing so in an indirect way through the
natural behavior of diversely constituted panels. This, indeed, has apparently been the position of the Chairperson of
the NEA since shortly after the legislation was first passed.
But the problems with this position are obvious. First, it
defies the statute's plain language to suggest that the NEA
complies with the law merely by allowing decency and respect to have their way through the subconscious inclinations of panel members. "[T]aking into consideration" is a
conscious activity. See Webster's New International Dictionary 2570 (2d ed. 1949) (defining "take into consideration"
as "[t]o make allowance in judging for"); id., at 569 (defining
"consideration" as the "[a]ct or process of considering; continuous and careful thought; examination; deliberation; attention"); id., at 568 (defining "consider" as "to think on with
care . . . to bear in mind"). Second, even assuming that diverse panel composition would produce a sufficient response
to the proviso, that would merely mean that selection for
decency and respect would occur derivatively through the
inclinations of the panel members, instead of directly
through the intentional application of the criteria; at the end
of the day, the proviso would still serve its purpose to screen
out offending artistic works, and it would still be unconstitutional. Finally, a less obvious but equally dispositive re524US2 Unit: $U95 [09-06-00 18:40:45] PAGES PGT: OPIN

609Cite as: 524 U. S. 569 (1998)
Souter, J., dissenting
sponse is that reading the statute as a mandate that maybe satisfied merely by selecting diverse panels renders

$ 954(d)(1) essentially redundant of $ 959(c), which providesthat the review panels must comprise "individuals reflecting
a wide geographic, ethnic, and minority representation aswell as individuals reflecting diverse artistic and cultural
points of view." Statutory interpretations that "rendersuperfluous other provisions in the same enactment" are
strongly disfavored. Freytag v. Commissioner, 501 U. S.868, 877 (1991) (internal quotation marks omitted).

C
A third try at avoiding constitutional problems is theCourt's disclaimer of any constitutional issue here because

"[$] 954(d)(1) adds `considerations' to the grant-making proc-ess; it does not preclude awards to projects that might be
deemed `indecent' or `disrespectful,' nor place conditions ongrants, or even specify that those factors must be given any
particular weight in reviewing an application." Ante, at580-581. Since "$ 954(d)(1) admonishes the NEA merely to
take `decency and respect' into consideration," ante, at 582,not to make funding decisions specifically on those grounds,
the Court sees no constitutional difficulty.That is not a fair reading. Just as the statute cannot be
read as anything but viewpoint based, or as requiring noth-ing more than diverse review panels, it cannot be read as
tolerating awards to spread indecency or disrespect, so longas the review panel, the National Council on the Arts, and
the Chairperson have given some thought to the offendingqualities and decided to underwrite them anyway. That,
after all, is presumably just what prompted the congres-sional outrage in the first place, and there was nothing naive
about the Representative who said he voted for the bill be-cause it does "not tolerate wasting Federal funds for sexually
explicit photographs [or] sacrilegious works." 136 Cong.Rec. 28676 (1990).

But even if I found the Court's view of "consideration"plausible, that would make no difference at all on the question of constitutionality. What if the statute required apanel to apply criteria "taking into consideration the centrality of Christianity to the American cultural experience," or"taking into consideration whether the artist is a communist," or "taking into consideration the political message con-veyed by the art," or even "taking into consideration the
superiority of the white race"? Would the Court hold theseconsiderations facially constitutional, merely because the
statute had no requirement to give them any particular,much less controlling, weight? I assume not. In such instances, the Court would hold that the First Amendmentbars the government from considering viewpoint when it decides whether to subsidize private speech, and a statute thatmandates the consideration of viewpoint is quite obviously
unconstitutional. Cf. Dawson v. Delaware, 503 U. S. 159,167 (1992) (holding that the First Amendment forbids reliance on a defendant's abstract beliefs at sentencing, even ifthey are considered as one factor among many);

Ozonoff v.Berzak, 744 F. 2d 224, 233 (CA1 1984) (Breyer, J.) (holding

that an Executive Order which provided that a person'spolitical associations "may be considered" in determining
security clearance violated the First Amendment). Sec-tion 954(d)(1) is just such a statute.

A second basic strand in the Court's treatment of today'squestion, see ante, at 585-587, and the heart of

Justice
Scalia's, see ante, at 595-599, in effect assume that whetheror not the statute mandates viewpoint discrimination, there

is no constitutional issue here because government art subsi-dies fall within a zone of activity free from First Amendment
restraints. The Government calls attention to the roles ofgovernment-as-speaker and government-as-buyer, in which

Third.5The Government freely admits, however, that it neither

heritage," $ 951(6), and that "[i]t is vital to a democracy . . .to provide financial assistance to its artists and the organizations that support their work," $ 951(10), the Governmentacts as a patron, financially underwriting the production
of art by private artists and impresarios for independentconsumption. Accordingly, the Government would have
us liberate government-as-patron from First Amendmentstrictures not by placing it squarely within the categories of government-as-buyer or government-as-speaker,

philosophy such as communism and fascism").

5 On proposing the Public Works Art Project (PWAP), the New Deal

program that hired artists to decorate public buildings, President Roosevelt allegedly remarked: "I can't have a lot of young enthusiasts painting
Lenin's head on the Justice Building." Quoted in Mankin, Federal Arts
Patronage in the New Deal, in America's Commitment to Culture: Government and the Arts 77 (K. Mulcahy & M. Wyszomirski eds. 1995). He was
buying, and was free to take his choice.

itself," Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. 819,

importance of the arts collectively, not an endorsement of the individual
message espoused in a given work of art.

but by recognizing a new category by analogy to thoseaccepted ones. The analogy is, however, a very poor fit,

and this patronage falls embarrassingly on the wrong sideof the line between government-as-buyer or -speaker and
government-as-regulator-of-private-speech.The division is reflected quite clearly in our precedents.
Drawing on the notion of government-as-speaker, we held in
Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U. S., at 194, that the Government wasentitled to appropriate public funds for the promotion of particular choices among alternatives offered by health and so-cial service providers (

e. g., family planning with, and without, resort to abortion). When the government promotes a
particular governmental program, "it is entitled to define thelimits of that program," and to dictate the viewpoint expressed by speakers who are paid to participate in it. Ibid.7But we added the important qualifying language that "[t]his
is not to suggest that funding by the Government, even when
coupled with the freedom of the fund recipients to speak outside the scope of the Government-funded project, is invari-ably sufficient to justify Government control over the content

of expression." Id., at 199. Indeed, outside of the contextsof government-as-buyer and government-as-speaker, we
have held time and time again that Congress may not "dis-criminate invidiously in its subsidies in such a way as to aim
at the suppression of . . . ideas." Regan v. Taxation with
Representation of Wash., 461 U. S. 540, 548 (1983) (internal
quotation marks and brackets omitted); see also Lamb's
Chapel, 508 U. S., at 394 (when the government subsidizesprivate speech, it may not "favor some viewpoints or ideas

at the expense of others"); Hannegan v. Esquire, Inc., 327

7 In Rust, "the government did not create a program to encourage private speech but instead used private speakers to transmit specific information pertaining to its own program. We recognized that when the government appropriates public funds to promote a particular policy of its own
it is entitled to say what it wishes." Rosenberger, supra, at 833 (citing
Rust, supra, at 194).

U. S. 146, 149 (1946) (the Postmaster General may not denysubsidies to certain periodicals on the ground that they are

" `morally improper and not for the public welfare and thepublic good' ").

Our most thorough statement of these principles is found
in the recent case of Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of
Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. 819 (1995), which held that the University of Virginia could not discriminate on viewpoint in under-writing the speech of student-run publications. We recognized that the government may act on the basis of viewpoint"when the State is the speaker" or when the State "disburses
public funds to private entities to convey a governmental
message." Id., at 833. But we explained that the government may not act on viewpoint when it "does not itself speak
or subsidize transmittal of a message it favors but instead
expends funds to encourage a diversity of views from private
speakers." Id., at 834. When the government acts as patron, subsidizing the expression of others, it may not prefer
one lawfully stated view over another.

Rosenberger controls here. The NEA, like the student activities fund in Rosenberger, is a subsidy scheme created to
encourage expression of a diversity of views from private
speakers. Congress brought the NEA into being to help all
Americans "achieve a better understanding of the past, a
better analysis of the present, and a better view of the future." $ 951(3). The NEA's purpose is to "support new
ideas" and "to help create and sustain . . . a climate encouraging freedom of thought, imagination, and inquiry."

$$ 951(10), (7); see also S. Rep. No. 300, 89th Cong., 1st Sess.,

p. 13 (1985) (Committee Report accompanying bill to reauthorize and amend the NEA's governing statute) ("As the Preamble of the act directs, the Endowment['s] programs should be
open and richly diverse, reflecting the ferment of ideas which
has always made this Nation strong and free"). Given this

congressional choice to sustain freedom of expression, Rosenberger teaches that the First Amendment forbids decisions based on viewpoint popularity. So long as Congress
chooses to subsidize expressive endeavors at large, it has no
business requiring the NEA to turn down funding applications of artists and exhibitors who devote their "freedom of
thought, imagination, and inquiry" to defying our tastes, our
beliefs, or our values. It may not use the NEA's purse to
"suppres[s] . . . dangerous ideas." Regan v. Taxation with
Representation of Wash., supra, at 548 (internal quotation
marks omitted).

The Court says otherwise, claiming to distinguish Rosenberger on the ground that the student activities funds in that
case were generally available to most applicants, whereas
NEA funds are disbursed selectively and competitively to a
choice few. Ante, at 586. But the Court in Rosenberger
anticipated and specifically rejected just this distinction
when it held in no uncertain terms that "[t]he government
cannot justify viewpoint discrimination among private
speakers on the economic fact of scarcity." 515 U. S., at 835.8
Scarce money demands choices, of course, but choices "on
some acceptable [viewpoint] neutral principle," like artistic
excellence and artistic merit; 9 "nothing in our decision[s] in8 The Court's attempt to avoid Rosenberger by describing NEA funding
in terms of competition, not scarcity, will not work. Competition implies
scarcity, without which there is no exclusive prize to compete for; the
Court's "competition" is merely a surrogate for "scarcity."

9 While criteria of "artistic excellence and artistic merit" may raise intractable issues about the identification of artistic worth, and could no
doubt be used covertly to filter out unwanted ideas, there is nothing inherently viewpoint discriminatory about such merit-based criteria. We have
noted before that an esthetic government goal is perfectly legitimate.
See Metromedia, Inc. v. San Diego, 453 U. S. 490, 507-508 (1981) (plurality
opinion). Decency and respect, on the other hand, are inherently and facially viewpoint based, and serve no legitimate and permissible end. The
Court's assertion that the mere fact that grants must be awarded according to artistic merit precludes "absolute neutrality" on the part of the

524US2 Unit: $U95 [09-06-00 18:40:45] PAGES PGT: OPIN

dicate[s] that scarcity would give the State the right to exercise viewpoint discrimination that is otherwise impermissible." Ibid.; see also Arkansas Ed. Television Comm'n v.
Forbes, 523 U. S. 666, 676 (1998) (scarcity of air time does not
justify viewpoint-based exclusion of candidates from a debate on public television; neutral selection criteria must be
employed). If the student activities fund at issue in Rosenberger had awarded competitive, merit-based grants to only
50%, or even 5%, of the applicants, on the basis of "journalistic merit taking into consideration the message of the newspaper," it is obvious beyond peradventure that the Court
would not have come out differently, leaving the University
free to refuse funding after considering a publication's Christian perspective.10

A word should be said, finally, about a proposed alternative to this failed analogy. As the Solicitor General put it

NEA, ante, at 585, is therefore misdirected. It is not to the point that
the Government necessarily makes choices among competing applications,
or even that its judgments about artistic quality may be branded as subjective to some greater or lesser degree; the question here is whether
the Government may apply patently viewpoint-based criteria in making
those choices.

10 Justice Scalia suggests that Rosenberger turned not on the distinction between government-as-speaker and government-as-facilitator-ofprivate-speech, but rather on the fact that "the government had established a limited public forum." Ante, at 599. Leaving aside the proper
application of forum analysis to the NEA and its projects, I cannot agree
that the holding of Rosenberger turned on characterizing its metaphorical
forum as public in some degree. Like this case, Rosenberger involved
viewpoint discrimination, and we have made it clear that such discrimination is impermissible in all forums, even nonpublic ones, Cornelius v.
NAACP Legal Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U. S. 788, 806 (1985), where,
by definition, the government has not made public property generally
available to facilitate private speech, Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators' Assn., 460 U. S. 37, 46 (1983) (defining a nonpublic forum as "[p]ublic property which is not by tradition or designation a forum for public
communication"). Accordingly, Rosenberger's brief allusion to forum
analysis was in no way determinative of the Court's holding.

at oral argument, "there is something unique . . . about the
Government funding of the arts for First Amendment purposes." Tr. of Oral Arg. 27. However different the governmental patron may be from the governmental speaker or
buyer, the argument goes, patronage is also singularly different from traditional regulation of speech, and the limitations
placed on the latter would be out of place when applied to
viewpoint discrimination in distributing patronage. To this,
there are two answers. The first, again, is Rosenberger,
which forecloses any claim that the NEA and the First
Amendment issues that arise under it are somehow unique.
But even if we had no Rosenberger, and even if I thought
the NEA's program of patronage was truly singular, I would
not hesitate to reject the Government's plea to recognize a
new, categorical patronage exemption from the requirement
of viewpoint neutrality. I would reject it for the simple reason that the Government has offered nothing to justify recognition of a new exempt category.

The question of who has the burden to justify a categorical
exemption has never been explicitly addressed by this Court,
despite our recognition of the speaker and buyer categories
in the past. The answer is nonetheless obvious in a recent
statement by the Court synthesizing a host of cases on viewpoint discrimination. "The First Amendment presumptively places this sort of discrimination beyond the power of
the government." Simon & Schuster, Inc. v. Members of
N. Y. State Crime Victims Bd., 502 U. S. 105, 116 (1991). Because it takes something to defeat a presumption, the burden
is necessarily on the Government to justify a new exception
to the fundamental rules that give life to the First Amendment. It is up to the Government to explain why a sphere
of governmental participation in the arts (unique or not)
should be treated as outside traditional First Amendment
limits. The Government has not carried this burden here,
or even squarely faced it.

Although I, like the Court, recognize that "facial chal-lenges to legislation are generally disfavored,"

FW/PBS, Inc.v. Dallas, 493 U. S. 215, 223 (1990), the proviso is the type of

statute that most obviously lends itself to such an attack.The NEA does not offer a list of reasons when it denies a
grant application, and an artist or exhibitor whose subjectraises a hint of controversy can never know for sure whether
the decency and respect criteria played a part in any decisionby the NEA to deny funding. Hence, the most that we
could hope for in waiting for an as-applied challenge wouldbe (a) a plaintiff whose rejected proposal raised some risk of
offense and was not aimed at exhibition in a forum in whichdecency and respect might serve as permissible selection criteria, or (b) a plaintiff who sought funding for a project thathad been sanitized to avoid rejection. But no one has denied here that the institutional plaintiff, the National Associ-ation of Artists' Organizations (NAAO), has representative
standing on behalf of some such potential plaintiffs. SeeApp. 21-25 (declaration of NAAO's Executive Director, listing examples of the potentially objectionable works producedby several member organizations). We would therefore
gain nothing at all by dismissing this case and requiringthose individuals or groups to bring essentially the same
suit, restyled as an as-applied challenge raising one of thepossibilities just mentioned.

In entertaining this challenge, the Court finds $ 954(d)(1)constitutional on its face in part because there are "a number
of indisputably constitutional applications" for both the "de-cency" and the "respect" criteria,

ante, at 584, and it is hardto imagine "how `decency' or `respect' would bear on grant

applications in categories such as funding for symphony or-chestras,"

ante, at 583. There are circumstances in whichwe have rejected facial challenges for similar reasons. "A

facial challenge to a legislative Act is, of course, the mostdifficult challenge to mount successfully, since the challenger

it is beyond question, as the Court freely concedes, that itcan have no application here, it being well settled that the

general rule does not limit challenges brought under theFirst Amendment's speech clause.

There is an "exception to th[e] [capable-of-constitutional-application] rule recognized in our jurisprudence [for] facial challenge[s] based upon First Amendment free-speechgrounds. We have applied to statutes restricting speech a

we have routinely understood the overbreadth doctrine toapply where the plaintiff mounts a facial challenge to a law

investing the government with discretion to discriminate onviewpoint when it parcels out benefits in support of speech.
See, e. g., City of Lakewood v. Plain Dealer Publishing Co.,
486 U. S. 750, 759 (1988) ("[A] facial challenge lies whenevera licensing law gives a government official or agency substantial power to discriminate based on the content or view-point of speech by suppressing disfavored speech or disliked
speakers"); Forsyth County v. Nationalist Movement, 505U. S. 123 (1992) (applying overbreadth doctrine to invalidate
on its face an ordinance allowing for content-based discrimi-nation in the awarding of parade permits).

To be sure, such a "facial challenge will not succeed unless
the statute is `substantially' overbroad," New York State
Club Assn., Inc. v. City of New York, 487 U. S. 1, 11 (1988),
by which we mean that "a law should not be invalidated for
overbreadth unless it reaches a substantial number of impermissible applications," New York v. Ferber, 458 U. S. 747, 771
(1982). But that is no impediment to invalidation here.
The Court speculates that the "decency" criterion might permissibly be applied to applications seeking to create or display art in schools 14 or children's museums, whereas the "respect" criterion might permissibly be applied to applications

we have not recognized an `overbreadth' doctrine outside the limited context of the First Amendment").

14 In placing such emphasis on the potential applicability of the decency

criterion to educational programs, the Court neglects to point out the existence of $ 954a, entitled "[a]ccess to the arts through support of education," which is concerned specifically with funding for arts education, especially in elementary and secondary schools. It seems that the NEA's
"mission" to promote arts education, ante, at 584, is carried out primarily
through $ 954a, not $ 954. While the decency standard might be constitutionally permissible when applied to applications for grants under $ 954a,
that standard does not appear to be relevant to such applications at all;
the decency and respect provision appears in $ 954(d), which governs grant
applications under $ 954, not under $ 954a.

seeking to create art that celebrates a minority, tribal, rural,or inner-city culture. But even so, this is certainly a case in

which the challenged statute "reaches a substantial numberof impermissible applications," not one in which the statute's
"legitimate reach dwarfs its arguably impermissible applications." Id., at 771, 773. On the contrary, nothing in therecord suggests that the grant scheme administered under

the broad authorization of the NEA's governing statute, see$$ 951, 954(c), devotes an overwhelming proportion of its resources to schools and ethnic commemoration. Since the de-cency and respect criteria may not be employed in the very
many instances in which the art seeking a subsidy is neitheraimed at children nor meant to celebrate a particular culture,
the statute is facially overbroad. Cf. City of Lakewood,
supra, at 766 ("[I]n a host of . . . First Amendment cases wehave . . . considered on the merits facial challenges to statutes or policies that embodied discrimination based on thecontent or viewpoint of expression, or vested officials with
open-ended discretion that threatened the same, even whereit was assumed that a properly drawn law could have greatly
restricted or prohibited the manner of expression or circula-tion at issue"). Accordingly, the Court's observation that
there are a handful of permissible applications of the decency
and respect proviso, even if true, is irrelevant.15

15 The Court seemingly concedes that these isolated constitutional applications are in fact of little matter. For after speaking of specific applications that may be valid, the Court goes on to admit that these "would
not alone be sufficient to sustain the statute." Ante, at 585. The Court
nonetheless upholds the statute because it is not "persuaded that, in other
applications, the language of $ 954(d)(1) itself will give rise to the suppression of protected expression." Ibid. This conclusion appears to rest on
some combination of (a) the Court's competition rationale as distinguishing
Rosenberger and justifying the discrimination, (b) the Court's reading of
the decency and respect proviso as something other than viewpoint based,
and (c) the Court's treatment of "taking into consideration" as establishing
no firm mandate subject to constitutional scrutiny. As already explained,

Souter, J., dissenting
The Government takes a different tack, arguing that over-breadth analysis is out of place in this case because the "prospect for `chilling' expressive conduct," which forms the basisfor the overbreadth doctrine, see, e. g., Massachusetts v.
Oakes, 491 U. S. 576, 584 (1989) (plurality opinion of O'Connor, J.), "is not present here." Brief for Petitioners 20-21,n. 5. But that is simply wrong. We have explained before

that the prospect of a denial of government funding neces-sarily carries with it the potential to "chil[l] . . . individual
thought and expression." Rosenberger, 515 U. S., at 835.In the world of NEA funding, this is so because the makers
or exhibitors of potentially controversial art will either trim
their work to avoid anything likely to offend, or refrain fromseeking NEA funding altogether. Either way, to whatever

extent NEA eligibility defines a national mainstream, theproviso will tend to create a timid esthetic. And either way,
the proviso's viewpoint discrimination will "chill the expres-sive activity of [persons] not before the court."

Forsyth
County, supra, at 129. See App. 22-24 (declaration of Char-lotte Murphy, Executive Director of respondent NAAO) (recounting how some NAAO members have not applied for
NEA grants for fear that their work would be found indecentor disrespectful, while others have applied but were "chilled

in their applications and in the scope of their projects" bythe decency and respect provision). Indeed, because NEA
grants are often matched by funds from private donors, theconstraining impact of $ 954(d)(1) is significantly magnified:

"[T]he chilling effect caused by [the NEA's viewpoint-based selection criteria] is exacerbated by the practical
realities of funding in the artistic community. Plainlystated, the NEA occupies a dominant and influential role
in the financial affairs of the art world in the United
however, fair reading of the text and attention to case law foreclose reliance on any, let alone all, of these arguments.

States. Because the NEA provides much of its support
with conditions that require matching or co-funding
from private sources, the NEA's funding involvement in
a project necessarily has a multiplier effect in the competitive market for funding of artistic endeavors. . . .
[In addition,] most non-federal funding sources regard
the NEA award as an imprimatur that signifies the
recipient's artistic merit and value. NEA grants lend
prestige and legitimacy to projects and are therefore
critical to the ability of artists and companies to attract
non-federal funding sources. Grant applicants rely on
the NEA well beyond the dollar value of any particular
grant." Bella Lewitzky Dance Foundation v. Frohnmayer, 754 F. Supp. 774, 783 (CD Cal. 1991) (footnote
and internal quotation marks omitted).16

Since the decency and respect proviso of $ 954(d)(1) is substantially overbroad and carries with it a significant power
to chill artistic production and display, it should be struck
down on its face.17

16 See also, e. g., 131 Cong. Rec. 24808 (1985) ("[S]upport from the Endowmen[t] has always represented a `Good Housekeeping Seal' of approval
which has helped grantees generate non-Federal dollars for projects and
productions").

17 I agree with the Court that $ 954(d) is not unconstitutionally vague.

Any chilling that results from imprecision in the drafting of standards
(such as "artistic excellence and artistic merit") by which the Government
awards scarce grants and scholarships is an inevitable and permissible
consequence of distributing prizes on the basis of criteria dealing with
a subject that defies exactness. The necessary imprecision of artisticmerit-based criteria justifies tolerating a degree of vagueness that might
be intolerable when applying the First Amendment to attempts to regulate political discussion. Cf. Arkansas Ed. Television Comm'n v. Forbes,
523 U. S. 666, 694-695 (1998) (Stevens, J., dissenting). My problem is
not with the chilling that may naturally result from necessarily open
standards; it is with the unacceptable chilling of "dangerous ideas,"
Speiser v. Randall, 357 U. S. 513, 519 (1958), that naturally results from
explicitly viewpoint-based standards.

The Court does not strike down the proviso, however. In-stead, it preserves the irony of a statutory mandate to deny

BRAGDON v. ABBOTT et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe first circuit

No. 97-156. Argued March 30, 1998--Decided June 25, 1998
Respondent Abbott is infected with the human immunodeficiency virus

(HIV), but had not manifested its most serious symptoms when the incidents in question occurred. At that time, she went to petitioner's office
for a dental examination and disclosed her HIV infection. Petitioner
discovered a cavity and informed respondent of his policy against filling
cavities of HIV-infected patients in his office. He offered to perform
the work at a hospital at no extra charge, though respondent would have
to pay for use of the hospital's facilities. She declined and filed suit
under, inter alia, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA),
which prohibits discrimination against any individual "on the basis of
disability in the . . . enjoyment of the . . . services . . . of any place of
public accommodation by any person who . . . operates [such] a place," 42
U. S. C. $ 12182(a), but qualifies the prohibition by providing: "Nothing
[herein] shall require an entity to permit an individual to participate
in or benefit from the . . . accommodations of such entity where such

individual poses a direct threat to the health or safety of others,"

$ 12182(b)(3). The District Court granted respondent summary judgment. The First Circuit affirmed, agreeing with the lower court that
respondent's HIV was a disability under the ADA even though her infection had not yet progressed to the symptomatic stage, and that treating her in petitioner's office would not have posed a direct threat to the
health and safety of others. In making the latter ruling, the court relied on the 1993 Dentistry Guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) and on the 1991 American Dental Association
Policy on HIV.

Held:

1. Even though respondent's HIV infection had not progressed to the
so-called symptomatic phase, it was a "disability" under $ 12102(2)(A),
that is, "a physical . . . impairment that substantially limits one or more
of [an individual's] major life activities." Pp. 630-647.

(a) The ADA definition is drawn almost verbatim from definitions
applicable to $ 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and another federal
statute. Because the ADA expressly provides that "nothing [herein]
shall be construed to apply a lesser standard than . . . under . . . the
Rehabilitation Act . . . or the regulations issued . . . pursuant to [it],"

Syllabus

$ 12201(a), this Court must construe the ADA to grant at least as much
protection as the regulations implementing the Rehabilitation Act.
Pp. 631-632.

(b) From the moment of infection and throughout every stage of
the disease, HIV infection satisfies the statutory and regulatory definition of a "physical impairment." Applicable Rehabilitation Act regulations define "physical or mental impairment" to mean "any physiological
disorder or condition . . . affecting . . . the . . . body['s] . . . hemic and
lymphatic [systems]." HIV infection falls well within that definition.
The medical literature reveals that the disease follows a predictable and
unalterable course from infection to inevitable death. It causes immediate abnormalities in a person's blood, and the infected person's white
cell count continues to drop throughout the course of the disease, even
during the intermediate stage when its attack is concentrated in the
lymph nodes. Thus, HIV infection must be regarded as a physiological
disorder with an immediate, constant, and detrimental effect on the
hemic and lymphatic systems. Pp. 632-637.

(c) The life activity upon which respondent relies, her ability to
reproduce and to bear children, constitutes a "major life activity" under
the ADA. The plain meaning of the word "major" denotes comparative
importance and suggests that the touchstone is an activity's significance.
Reproduction and the sexual dynamics surrounding it are central to the
life process itself. Petitioner's claim that Congress intended the ADA
only to cover those aspects of a person's life that have a public, economic,
or daily character founders on the statutory language. Nothing in the
definition suggests that activities without such a dimension may somehow be regarded as so unimportant or insignificant as not to be "major."
This interpretation is confirmed by the Rehabilitation Act regulations,
which provide an illustrative, nonexhaustive list of major life activities. Inclusion on that list of activities such as caring for one's
self, performing manual tasks, working, and learning belies the suggestion that a task must have a public or economic character. On the contrary, the regulations support the inclusion of reproduction, which could
not be regarded as any less important than working and learning.
Pp. 637-639.

(d) Respondent's HIV infection "substantially limits" her major life
activity within the ADA's meaning. Although the Rehabilitation Act
regulations provide little guidance in this regard, the Court's evaluation
of the medical evidence demonstrates that an HIV-infected woman's
ability to reproduce is substantially limited in two independent ways: If
she tries to conceive a child, (1) she imposes on her male partner a
statistically significant risk of becoming infected; and (2) she risks infecting her child during gestation and childbirth, i. e., perinatal trans524US2 Unit: $U96 [09-15-00 14:39:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Syllabus
mission. Evidence suggesting that antiretroviral therapy can lower the
risk of perinatal transmission to about 8%, even if relevant, does not
avail petitioner because it cannot be said as a matter of law that an 8%
risk of transmitting a dread and fatal disease to one's child does not
represent a substantial limitation on reproduction. The decision to
reproduce carries economic and legal consequences as well. There are
added costs for antiretroviral therapy, supplemental insurance, and
long-term health care for the child who must be examined and treated.
Some state laws, moreover, forbid HIV-infected persons to have sex
with others, regardless of consent. In the context of reviewing summary judgment, the Court must take as true respondent's unchallenged
testimony that her HIV infection controlled her decision not to have a
child. Pp. 639-642.

(e) The uniform body of administrative and judicial precedent interpreting similar language in the Rehabilitation Act confirms the Court's
holding. Every agency and court to consider the issue under the Rehabilitation Act has found statutory coverage for persons with asymptomatic HIV. The uniformity of that precedent is significant. When administrative and judicial interpretations have settled the meaning of an
existing statutory provision, repetition of the same language in a new
statute indicates, as a general matter, Congress' intent to incorporate
such interpretations as well. See, e. g., Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U. S. 575,
580-581. Pp. 642-645.

(f) The Court's holding is further reinforced by the guidance issued
by the Justice Department and other agencies authorized to administer
the ADA, which supports the conclusion that persons with asymptomatic HIV fall within the ADA's definition of disability. The views of
agencies charged with implementing a statute are entitled to deference.
See Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,
467 U. S. 837, 844. Pp. 646-647.

2. In affirming the summary judgment, the First Circuit did not cite
sufficient material in the record to determine, as a matter of law, that
respondent's HIV infection posed no direct threat to the health and
safety of others. The ADA's direct threat provision, $ 12182(b)(3),
stems from School Bd. of Nassau Cty. v. Arline, 480 U. S. 273, 287, in
which this Court reconciled competing interests in prohibiting discrimination and preventing the spread of disease by construing the Rehabilitation Act not to require the hiring of a person who posed "a significant
risk of communicating an infectious disease to others," id., at 287, and
n. 16. The existence of a significant risk is determined from the standpoint of the health care professional who refuses treatment or accommodation, and the risk assessment is based on the medical or other objec524US2 Unit: $U96 [09-15-00 14:39:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN

tive, scientific evidence available to him and his profession, not simply
on his good-faith belief that a significant risk existed. See id., at 288;
id., at 288, n. 18, distinguished. For the most part, the First Circuit
followed the proper standard and conducted a thorough review of the
evidence. However, it might have mistakenly relied on the 1993 CDC
Dentistry Guidelines, which recommend certain universal precautions
to combat the risk of HIV transmission in the dental environment, but
do not actually assess the level of such risk, and on the 1991 American
Dental Association Policy on HIV, which is the work of a professional
organization, not a public health authority, and which does not reveal
the extent to which it was based on the Association's assessment of
dentists' ethical and professional duties, rather than scientific assessments. Other evidence in the record might support affirmance of the
trial court's ruling, and there are reasons to doubt whether petitioner
advanced evidence sufficient to raise a triable issue of fact on the significance of the risk, but this Court's evaluation is constrained by the
fact that it has not had briefs and arguments directed to the entire
record. A remand will permit a full exploration of the issues through
the adversary process. Pp. 648-655.

patient registration form. Petitioner completed a dentalexamination, discovered a cavity, and informed respondent

of his policy against filling cavities of HIV-infected patients.He offered to perform the work at a hospital with no added
fee for his services, though respondent would be responsiblefor the cost of using the hospital's facilities. Respondent
declined.Respondent sued petitioner under state law and $ 302 of
the ADA, 104 Stat. 355, 42 U. S. C. $ 12182, alleging discrimi-nation on the basis of her disability. The state-law claims
are not before us. Section 302 of the ADA provides:

"No individual shall be discriminated against on thebasis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of the

goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or ac-commodations of any place of public accommodation by
any person who . . . operates a place of public accommo-dation." $ 12182(a).

The term "public accommodation" is defined to include the"professional office of a health care provider." $ 12181(7)(F).

A later subsection qualifies the mandate not to discrimi-nate. It provides:

"Nothing in this subchapter shall require an entity topermit an individual to participate in or benefit from the
goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages andaccommodations of such entity where such individual
poses a direct threat to the health or safety of others."$ 12182(b)(3).

The United States and the Maine Human Rights Commis-sion intervened as plaintiffs. After discovery, the parties

further that petitioner raised no genuine issue of materialfact as to whether respondent's HIV infection would have

court relied on affidavits submitted by Dr. Donald Wayne
Marianos, Director of the Division of Oral Health of the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The
Marianos affidavits asserted it is safe for dentists to treat
patients infected with HIV in dental offices if the dentist
follows the so-called universal precautions described in the
Recommended Infection-Control Practices for Dentistry
issued by CDC in 1993 (1993 CDC Dentistry Guidelines).
912 F. Supp., at 589.

The Court of Appeals affirmed. It held respondent's HIV
infection was a disability under the ADA, even though her
infection had not yet progressed to the symptomatic stage.
107 F. 3d 934, 939-943 (CA1 1997). The Court of Appeals
also agreed that treating the respondent in petitioner's office
would not have posed a direct threat to the health and safety
of others. Id., at 943-948. Unlike the District Court, however, the Court of Appeals declined to rely on the Marianos
affidavits. Id., at 946, n. 7. Instead the court relied on the
1993 CDC Dentistry Guidelines, as well as the Policy on
AIDS, HIV Infection and the Practice of Dentistry, promulgated by the American Dental Association in 1991 (1991
American Dental Association Policy on HIV). 107 F. 3d, at
945-946.

II

We first review the ruling that respondent's HIV infection
constituted a disability under the ADA. The statute defines
disability as:

"(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of
such individual;

"(B) a record of such an impairment; or
"(C) being regarded as having such an impairment."

$ 12102(2).

631Cite as: 524 U. S. 624 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
We hold respondent's HIV infection was a disability under
subsection (A) of the definitional section of the statute. In
light of this conclusion, we need not consider the applicability
of subsections (B) or (C).

Our consideration of subsection (A) of the definition proceeds in three steps. First, we consider whether respondent's HIV infection was a physical impairment. Second, we
identify the life activity upon which respondent relies (reproduction and childbearing) and determine whether it constitutes a major life activity under the ADA. Third, tying the
two statutory phrases together, we ask whether the impairment substantially limited the major life activity. In construing the statute, we are informed by interpretations of
parallel definitions in previous statutes and the views of various administrative agencies which have faced this interpretive question.

A

The ADA's definition of disability is drawn almost verbatim from the definition of "handicapped individual" included
in the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 87 Stat. 361, as amended,
29 U. S. C. $ 706(8)(B) (1988 ed.), and the definition of "handicap" contained in the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988,
102 Stat. 1619, 42 U. S. C. $ 3602(h)(1) (1988 ed.). Congress'
repetition of a well-established term carries the implication that Congress intended the term to be construed in accordance with pre-existing regulatory interpretations. See
FDIC v. Philadelphia Gear Corp., 476 U. S. 426, 437-438
(1986); Commissioner v. Estate of Noel, 380 U. S. 678, 681-
682 (1965); ICC v. Parker, 326 U. S. 60, 65 (1945). In this
case, Congress did more than suggest this construction; it
adopted a specific statutory provision in the ADA directing
as follows:

"Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, nothing

The directive requires us to construe the ADA to grant atleast as much protection as provided by the regulations

implementing the Rehabilitation Act.

1
The first step in the inquiry under subsection (A) requiresus to determine whether respondent's condition constituted a

physical impairment. The Department of Health, Educationand Welfare (HEW) issued the first regulations interpreting
the Rehabilitation Act in 1977. The regulations are ofparticular significance because, at the time, HEW was the
agency responsible for coordinating the implementation andenforcement of $ 504 of that statute.

Consolidated RailCorporation v. Darrone, 465 U. S. 624, 634 (1984) (citing

Exec. Order No. 11914, 3 CFR 117 (1976-1980 Comp.)). Sec-tion 504 prohibits discrimination against individuals with
disabilities by recipients of federal financial assistance. 29U. S. C. $ 794. The HEW regulations, which appear without
change in the current regulations issued by the Departmentof Health and Human Services, define "physical or mental
impairment" to mean:

"(A) any physiological disorder or condition, cosmeticdisfigurement, or anatomical loss affecting one or more

of the following body systems: neurological; musculo-skeletal; special sense organs; respiratory, including
speech organs; cardiovascular; reproductive, digestive,genito-urinary; hemic and lymphatic; skin; and endocrine; or"(B) any mental or psychological disorder, such as
mental retardation, organic brain syndrome, emotionalor mental illness, and specific learning disabilities." 45
CFR $ 84.3( j)(2)(i) (1997).

Opinion of the Court
In issuing these regulations, HEW decided against includinga list of disorders constituting physical or mental impairments, out of concern that any specific enumeration mightnot be comprehensive. 42 Fed. Reg. 22685 (1977), reprinted
in 45 CFR pt. 84, App. A, p. 334 (1997). The commentary
accompanying the regulations, however, contains a repre-sentative list of disorders and conditions constituting physical impairments, including "such diseases and conditions asorthopedic, visual, speech, and hearing impairments, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis,cancer, heart disease, diabetes, mental retardation, emotional illness, and . . . drug addiction and alcoholism." Ibid.

In 1980, the President transferred responsibility for the
implementation and enforcement of $ 504 to the Attorney
General. See, e. g., Exec. Order No. 12250, 3 CFR 298
(1981). The regulations issued by the Justice Department,
which remain in force to this day, adopted verbatim the
HEW definition of physical impairment quoted above. 28
CFR $ 41.31(b)(1) (1997). In addition, the representative list
of diseases and conditions originally relegated to the commentary accompanying the HEW regulations were incorporated into the text of the regulations. Ibid.

HIV infection is not included in the list of specific disorders constituting physical impairments, in part because HIV
was not identified as the cause of AIDS until 1983. See
Barre' -Sinoussi et al., Isolation of a T-Lymphotropic Retrovirus from a Patient at Risk for Acquired Immune Deficiency
Syndrome (AIDS), 220 Science 868 (1983); Gallo et al., Frequent Detection and Isolation of Cytopathic Retroviruses
(HTLV-III) from Patients with AIDS and at Risk for AIDS,
224 Science 500 (1984); Levy et al., Isolation of Lymphocytopathic Retroviruses from San Francisco Patients with AIDS,
225 Science 840 (1984). HIV infection does fall well within
the general definition set forth by the regulations, however.

The disease follows a predictable and, as of today, an unalterable course. Once a person is infected with HIV, the

Opinion of the Court
virus invades different cells in the blood and in body tissues.Certain white blood cells, known as helper T-lymphocytes or

CD4` cells, are particularly vulnerable to HIV. The virusattaches to the CD4 receptor site of the target cell and fuses
its membrane to the cell's membrane. HIV is a retrovirus,
which means it uses an enzyme to convert its own geneticmaterial into a form indistinguishable from the genetic material of the target cell. The virus' genetic material migratesto the cell's nucleus and becomes integrated with the cell's
chromosomes. Once integrated, the virus can use the cell'sown genetic machinery to replicate itself. Additional copies
of the virus are released into the body and infect other cells
in turn. Young, The Replication Cycle of HIV-1, in The
AIDS Knowledge Base, pp. 3.1-2 to 3.1-7 (P. Cohen, M.
Sande, & P. Volberding eds., 2d ed. 1994) (hereinafter AIDS
Knowledge Base); Folks & Hart, The Life Cycle of Human
Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1, in AIDS: Etiology, Diagnosis, Treatment and Prevention 29-39 (V. DeVita et al. eds.,

ed. 1997) (hereinafter Medical Management of AIDS). Although the body does produce antibodies to combat HIV infection, the antibodies are not effective in eliminating the
virus. Pantaleo et al., Immunopathogenesis of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection, in AIDS: Etiology 79; Gardner, HIV Vaccine Development, in AIDS Knowledge Base
3.6-5; Haynes, Immune Responses to Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection, in AIDS: Etiology 91.

The virus eventually kills the infected host cell. CD4`
cells play a critical role in coordinating the body's immune
response system, and the decline in their number causes
corresponding deterioration of the body's ability to fight infections from many sources. Tracking the infected individual's CD4` cell count is one of the most accurate measures of

the course of the disease. Greene, Medical Management of

The initial stage of HIV infection is known as acute
or primary HIV infection. In a typical case, this stagelasts three months. The virus concentrates in the blood.

The assault on the immune system is immediate. The vic-tim suffers from a sudden and serious decline in the number of white blood cells. There is no latency period.Mononucleosis-like symptoms often emerge between six days
and six weeks after infection, at times accompanied by fever,
headache, enlargement of the lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy), muscle pain (myalgia), rash, lethargy, gastrointestinal
disorders, and neurological disorders. Usually these symptoms abate within 14 to 21 days. HIV antibodies appear
in the bloodstream within 3 weeks; circulating HIV can be
detected within 10 weeks. Carr & Cooper, Primary HIV
Infection, in Medical Management of AIDS 89-91; Cohen &
Volberding, Clinical Spectrum of HIV Disease, in AIDS
Knowledge Base 4.1-7; Crowe & McGrath, Acute HIV Infection, in AIDS Knowledge Base 4.2-1 to 4.2-4; Saag, AIDS:
Etiology 204-205.

After the symptoms associated with the initial stage subside, the disease enters what is referred to sometimes as its
asymptomatic phase. The term is a misnomer, in some respects, for clinical features persist throughout, including
lymphadenopathy, dermatological disorders, oral lesions, and
bacterial infections. Although it varies with each individual, in most instances this stage lasts from 7 to 11 years.
The virus now tends to concentrate in the lymph nodes,
though low levels of the virus continue to appear in the
blood. Cohen & Volberding, AIDS Knowledge Base 4.1-4,

Opinion of the Court
thought the virus became inactive during this period, but it
is now known that the relative lack of symptoms is attributable to the virus' migration from the circulatory system into
the lymph nodes. Cohen & Volberding, AIDS Knowledge
Base 4.1-4. The migration reduces the viral presence in
other parts of the body, with a corresponding diminution in
physical manifestations of the disease. The virus, however,
thrives in the lymph nodes, which, as a vital point of the
body's immune response system, represents an ideal environment for the infection of other CD4` cells. Staprans &
Feinberg, Medical Management of AIDS 33-34. Studies
have shown that viral production continues at a high rate.
Cohen & Volberding, AIDS Knowledge Base 4.1-4; Staprans & Feinberg, Medical Management of AIDS 38. CD4`
cells continue to decline an average of 5% to 10% (40 to 80
cells/mm3) per year throughout this phase. Saag, AIDS:
Etiology 207.

A person is regarded as having AIDS when his or her
CD4` count drops below 200 cells/mm3 of blood or when
CD4` cells comprise less than 14% of his or her total lymphocytes. U. S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, Public

During this stage, the clinical conditions most often associated with HIV, such as pneumocystis carninii pneumonia,
Kaposi's sarcoma, and non-Hodgkins lymphoma, tend to appear. In addition, the general systemic disorders present
during all stages of the disease, such as fever, weight loss,
fatigue, lesions, nausea, and diarrhea, tend to worsen. In
most cases, once the patient's CD4` count drops below 10

cells/mm3, death soon follows. Cohen & Volberding, AIDSKnowledge Base 4.1-9; Saag, AIDS: Etiology 207-209.

In light of the immediacy with which the virus begins todamage the infected person's white blood cells and the severity of the disease, we hold it is an impairment from the mo-ment of infection. As noted earlier, infection with HIV
causes immediate abnormalities in a person's blood, and theinfected person's white cell count continues to drop throughout the course of the disease, even when the attack is concen-trated in the lymph nodes. In light of these facts, HIV infection must be regarded as a physiological disorder with aconstant and detrimental effect on the infected person's
hemic and lymphatic systems from the moment of infection.HIV infection satisfies the statutory and regulatory definition of a physical impairment during every stage of thedisease.

2
The statute is not operative, and the definition not satis-fied, unless the impairment affects a major life activity. Respondent's claim throughout this case has been that the HIVinfection placed a substantial limitation on her ability to reproduce and to bear children. App. 14; 912 F. Supp., at 586;107 F. 3d, at 939. Given the pervasive, and invariably fatal,
course of the disease, its effect on major life activities ofmany sorts might have been relevant to our inquiry. Respondent and a number of amici make arguments aboutHIV's profound impact on almost every phase of the infected
person's life. See Brief for Respondent Abbott 24-27; Brieffor American Medical Association as Amicus Curiae 20;
Brief for Infectious Diseases Society of America et al. as
Amici Curiae 7-11. In light of these submissions, it mayseem legalistic to circumscribe our discussion to the activity

of reproduction. We have little doubt that had differentparties brought the suit they would have maintained that an
HIV infection imposes substantial limitations on other majorlife activities.

638 BRAGDON v. ABBOTT

Opinion of the Court
From the outset, however, the case has been treated asone in which reproduction was the major life activity limited

by the impairment. It is our practice to decide cases on thegrounds raised and considered in the Court of Appeals and
included in the question on which we granted certiorari.
See, e. g., Blessing v. Freestone, 520 U. S. 329, 340, n. 3 (1997)(citing this Court's Rule 14.1(a));

Capitol Square Review and
Advisory Bd. v. Pinette, 515 U. S. 753, 760 (1995). We ask,then, whether reproduction is a major life activity.

We have little difficulty concluding that it is. As theCourt of Appeals held, "[t]he plain meaning of the word
`major' denotes comparative importance" and "suggest[s]
that the touchstone for determining an activity's inclusion
under the statutory rubric is its significance." 107 F. 3d, at
939, 940. Reproduction falls well within the phrase "major
life activity." Reproduction and the sexual dynamics surrounding it are central to the life process itself.

While petitioner concedes the importance of reproduction,
he claims that Congress intended the ADA only to cover
those aspects of a person's life which have a public, economic,
or daily character. Brief for Petitioner 14, 28, 30, 31; see
also id., at 36-37 (citing Krauel v. Iowa Methodist Medical
Center, 95 F. 3d 674, 677 (CA8 1996)). The argument founders on the statutory language. Nothing in the definition
suggests that activities without a public, economic, or daily
dimension may somehow be regarded as so unimportant or
insignificant as to fall outside the meaning of the word
"major." The breadth of the term confounds the attempt to
limit its construction in this manner.

As we have noted, the ADA must be construed to be consistent with regulations issued to implement the Rehabilitation Act. See 42 U. S. C. $ 12201(a). Rather than enunciating a general principle for determining what is and is not a
major life activity, the Rehabilitation Act regulations instead
provide a representative list, defining the term to include
"functions such as caring for one's self, performing manual

524US2 Unit: $U96 [09-15-00 14:39:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learn-ing, and working." 45 CFR $ 84.3( j)(2)(ii) (1997); 28 CFR

$ 41.31(b)(2) (1997). As the use of the term "such as" con-firms, the list is illustrative, not exhaustive.

These regulations are contrary to petitioner's attempt tolimit the meaning of the term "major" to public activities.
The inclusion of activities such as caring for one's self andperforming manual tasks belies the suggestion that a task
must have a public or economic character in order to be amajor life activity for purposes of the ADA. On the contrary, the Rehabilitation Act regulations support the inclu-sion of reproduction as a major life activity, since reproduction could not be regarded as any less important thanworking and learning. Petitioner advances no credible basis
for confining major life activities to those with a public, eco-nomic, or daily aspect. In the absence of any reason to
reach a contrary conclusion, we agree with the Court of Ap-peals' determination that reproduction is a major life activity
for the purposes of the ADA.

3
The final element of the disability definition in subsection(A) is whether respondent's physical impairment was a substantial limit on the major life activity she asserts. The Re-habilitation Act regulations provide no additional guidance.
45 CFR pt. 84, App. A, p. 334 (1997).Our evaluation of the medical evidence leads us to conclude
that respondent's infection substantially limited her abilityto reproduce in two independent ways. First, a woman infected with HIV who tries to conceive a child imposes on theman a significant risk of becoming infected. The cumulative
results of 13 studies collected in a 1994 textbook on AIDSindicates that 20% of male partners of women with HIV
became HIV-positive themselves, with a majority of thestudies finding a statistically significant risk of infection.

transmission. See, e. g., Osmond & Padian, AIDS Knowl-edge Base 1.9-3, tbl. 1, 1.9-6 to 1.9-7.)

Second, an infected woman risks infecting her child duringgestation and childbirth,

i. e., perinatal transmission. Petitioner concedes that women infected with HIV face about a25% risk of transmitting the virus to their children. 107

F. 3d, at 942; 912 F. Supp., at 587, n. 6. Published reports
available in 1994 confirm the accuracy of this statistic. Report of a Consensus Workshop, Maternal Factors Involved in
Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV-1, 5 J. Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes 1019, 1020 (1992) (collecting 13
studies placing risk between 14% and 40%, with most studies
falling within the 25% to 30% range); Connor et al., Reduction of Maternal-Infant Transmission of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 with Zidovudine Treatment, 331 New
England J. Med. 1173, 1176 (1994) (placing risk at 25.5%); see
also Staprans & Feinberg, Medical Management of AIDS 32
(studies report 13% to 45% risk of infection, with average of
approximately 25%).

Petitioner points to evidence in the record suggesting that
antiretroviral therapy can lower the risk of perinatal transmission to about 8%. App. 53; see also Connor, supra, at
1176 (8.3%); Sperling et al., Maternal Viral Load, Zidovudine
Treatment, and the Risk of Transmission of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 from Mother to Infant, 335 New
England J. Med. 1621, 1622 (1996) (7.6%). The United States
questions the relevance of the 8% figure, pointing to regulatory language requiring the substantiality of a limitation to be assessed without regard to available mitigating

measures. Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 18,
n. 10 (citing 28 CFR pt. 36, App. B, p. 611 (1997); 29 CFR pt.

Opinion of the Court
1630, App., p. 351 (1997)). We need not resolve this disputein order to decide this case, however. It cannot be said as

a matter of law that an 8% risk of transmitting a dread andfatal disease to one's child does not represent a substantial
limitation on reproduction.

The Act addresses substantial limitations on major life ac-tivities, not utter inabilities. Conception and childbirth are

not impossible for an HIV victim but, without doubt, aredangerous to the public health. This meets the definition of
a substantial limitation. The decision to reproduce carrieseconomic and legal consequences as well. There are added
costs for antiretroviral therapy, supplemental insurance, and
long-term health care for the child who must be examined
and, tragic to think, treated for the infection. The laws of
some States, moreover, forbid persons infected with HIV to
have sex with others, regardless of consent. Iowa Code

$$ 139.1, 139.31 (1997); Md. Health Code Ann. $ 18-601.1(a)
(1994); Mont. Code Ann. $$ 50-18-101, 50-18-112 (1997);
Utah Code Ann. $ 26-6-3.5(3) (Supp. 1997); id., $ 26-6-5

also N. D. Cent. Code $ 12.1-20-17 (1997).

In the end, the disability definition does not turn on personal choice. When significant limitations result from the
impairment, the definition is met even if the difficulties are
not insurmountable. For the statistical and other reasons
we have cited, of course, the limitations on reproduction may
be insurmountable here. Testimony from the respondent
that her HIV infection controlled her decision not to have a
child is unchallenged. App. 14; 912 F. Supp., at 587; 107
F. 3d, at 942. In the context of reviewing summary judgment, we must take it to be true. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56(e).
We agree with the District Court and the Court of Appeals
that no triable issue of fact impedes a ruling on the question
of statutory coverage. Respondent's HIV infection is a
physical impairment which substantially limits a major life
activity, as the ADA defines it. In view of our holding, we

Opinion of the Court
need not address the second question presented, i. e.,whether HIV infection is a per se disability under the ADA.

B
Our holding is confirmed by a consistent course of agencyinterpretation before and after enactment of the ADA.

Every agency to consider the issue under the RehabilitationAct found statutory coverage for persons with asymptomatic
HIV. Responsibility for administering the RehabilitationAct was not delegated to a single agency, but we need not
pause to inquire whether this causes us to withhold defer-ence to agency interpretations under

Chevron U. S. A. Inc.v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837,

844 (1984). It is enough to observe that the well-reasonedviews of the agencies implementing a statute "constitute a
body of experience and informed judgment to which courtsand litigants may properly resort for guidance."

Skidmorev. Swift & Co., 323 U. S. 134, 139-140 (1944).

One comprehensive and significant administrative prece-dent is a 1988 opinion issued by the Office of Legal Counsel
of the Department of Justice (OLC) concluding that the Re-habilitation Act "protects symptomatic and asymptomatic
HIV-infected individuals against discrimination in any cov-ered program." Application of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act to HIV-Infected Individuals, 12 Op. Off. LegalCounsel 264, 264-265 (Sept. 27, 1988) (preliminary print)
(footnote omitted). Relying on a letter from Surgeon Gen-eral C. Everett Koop stating that, "from a purely scientific
perspective, persons with HIV are clearly impaired" evenduring the asymptomatic phase, OLC determined asymptomatic HIV was a physical impairment under the Rehabilita-tion Act because it constituted a "physiological disorder or
condition affecting the hemic and lymphatic systems." Id.,at 271 (internal quotation marks omitted). OLC determined
further that asymptomatic HIV imposed a substantial limiton the major life activity of reproduction. The opinion said:

Opinion of the Court
"Based on the medical knowledge available to us, we be-lieve that it is reasonable to conclude that the life activity of procreation . . . is substantially limited for anasymptomatic HIV-infected individual. In light of the

significant risk that the AIDS virus may be transmittedto a baby during pregnancy, HIV-infected individuals
cannot, whether they are male or female, engage in theact of procreation with the normal expectation of bringing forth a healthy child." Id., at 273.
In addition, OLC indicated that "[t]he life activity of engag-ing in sexual relations is threatened and probably substantially limited by the contagiousness of the virus." Id., at274. Either consideration was sufficient to render asymptomatic HIV infection a handicap for purposes of the Rehabili-tation Act. In the course of its opinion, OLC considered,
and rejected, the contention that the limitation could be dis-counted as a voluntary response to the infection. The limitation, it reasoned, was the infection's manifest physical ef-fect.

Id., at 274, and n. 13. Without exception, the otheragencies to address the problem before enactment of the

and Permits Admin., 740 F. Supp. 95, 103 (PR 1990) (Fair

prior to the enactment of the ADA in which a court or
agency ruled that HIV infection was not a handicap under
the Rehabilitation Act.

Had Congress done nothing more than copy the Rehabilitation Act definition into the ADA, its action would indicate

645Cite as: 524 U. S. 624 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
the new statute should be construed in light of this unwavering line of administrative and judicial interpretation. All indications are that Congress was well aware of the position
taken by OLC when enacting the ADA and intended to give
that position its active endorsement. H. R. Rep. No. 101-
485, pt. 2, p. 52 (1990) (endorsing the analysis and conclusion
of the OLC opinion); id., pt. 3, at 28, n. 18 (same); S. Rep. No.
101-116, pp. 21, 22 (1989) (same). As noted earlier, Congress
also incorporated the same definition into the Fair Housing
Amendments Act of 1988. See 42 U. S. C. $ 3602(h)(1). We
find it significant that the implementing regulations issued
by the Department of Housing and Urban Development
(HUD) construed the definition to include infection with
HIV. 54 Fed. Reg. 3232, 3245 (1989) (codified at 24 CFR

$ 100.201 (1997)); see also In re Williams, 2A P-H Fair
Housing-Fair Lending || 25,007, pp. 25,111-25,113 (HUD Off.
Admin. Law Judges, Mar. 22, 1991) (adhering to this interpretation); In re Elroy R. and Dorothy Burns Trust, 2A
P-H Fair Housing-Fair Lending || 25,073, p. 25,678 (HUD Off.
Admin. Law Judges, June 17, 1994) (same). Again the legislative record indicates that Congress intended to ratify
HUD's interpretation when it reiterated the same definition
in the ADA. H. R. Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 2, at 50; id., pt. 3,
at 27; id., pt. 4, at 36; S. Rep. No. 101-116, at 21.

We find the uniformity of the administrative and judicial
precedent construing the definition significant. When administrative and judicial interpretations have settled the
meaning of an existing statutory provision, repetition of the
same language in a new statute indicates, as a general matter, the intent to incorporate its administrative and judicial
interpretations as well. See, e. g., Lorillard v. Pons, 434
U. S. 575, 580-581 (1978). The uniform body of administrative and judicial precedent confirms the conclusion we reach
today as the most faithful way to effect the congressional
design.

Opinion of the Court

C
Our conclusion is further reinforced by the administrativeguidance issued by the Justice Department to implement the

public accommodation provisions of Title III of the ADA.As the agency directed by Congress to issue implementing
regulations, see 42 U. S. C. $ 12186(b), to render technical as-sistance explaining the responsibilities of covered individuals
and institutions, $ 12206(c), and to enforce Title III in court,$ 12188(b), the Department's views are entitled to deference.
See Chevron, 467 U. S., at 844.The Justice Department's interpretation of the definition
of disability is consistent with our analysis. The regulationsacknowledge that Congress intended the ADA's definition of
disability to be given the same construction as the definitionof handicap in the Rehabilitation Act. 28 CFR $ 36.103(a)
(1997); id., pt. 36, App. B, pp. 608, 609. The regulatory defi-nition developed by HEW to implement the Rehabilitation
Act is incorporated verbatim in the ADA regulations.$ 36.104. The Justice Department went further, however.
It added "HIV infection (symptomatic and asymptomatic)"to the list of disorders constituting a physical impairment.

$ 36.104(1)(iii). The technical assistance the Department hasissued pursuant to 42 U. S. C. $ 12206 similarly concludes that
persons with asymptomatic HIV infection fall within theADA's definition of disability. See, e. g., U. S. Dept. of Justice, Civil Rights Division, The Americans with DisabilitiesAct: Title III Technical Assistance Manual 9 (Nov. 1993); Response to Congressman Sonny Callahan, 5 Nat. Disability L.Rep. (LRP) || 360, p. 1167 (Feb. 9, 1994); Response to A. Laurence Field, 5 Nat. Disability L. Rep. (LRP) || 21, p. 80 (Sept.10, 1993). Any other conclusion, the Department reasoned,
would contradict Congress' affirmative ratification of the ad-ministrative interpretations given previous versions of the
same definition. 28 CFR pt. 36, App. B, pp. 609, 610 (1997)(citing the OLC opinion and HUD regulations); 56 Fed. Reg.
7455, 7456 (1991) (same) (notice of proposed rulemaking).

Opinion of the Court
We also draw guidance from the views of the agencies authorized to administer other sections of the ADA.
See 42 U. S. C. $ 12116 (authorizing EEOC to issue regulations implementing Title I); $ 12134(a) (authorizing the Attorney General to issue regulations implementing the public
services provisions of Title II, subtitle A); $$ 12149, 12164,
12186 (authorizing the Secretary of Transportation to issue
regulations implementing the transportation-related provisions of Titles II and III); $ 12206(c) (authorizing the same
agencies to offer technical assistance for the provisions they
administer). These agencies, too, concluded that HIV infection is a physical impairment under the ADA. 28 CFR

$ 35.104(1)(iii) (1997); 49 CFR $$ 37.3, 38.3 (1997); 56 Fed.
Reg. 13858 (1991); U. S. Dept. of Justice, Civil Rights Division, The Americans with Disabilities Act: Title II Technical
Assistance Manual 4 (Nov. 1993); EEOC, A Technical Assistance Manual on the Employment Provisions (Title I) of the
Americans with Disabilities Act II-3 (Jan. 1992) (hereinafter
EEOC Technical Assistance Manual); EEOC Interpretive
Manual $ 902.2(d), pp. 902-13 to 902-14 (reissued Mar. 14,
1995) (hereinafter EEOC Interpretive Manual), reprinted in
2 BNA EEOC Compliance Manual 902:0013 (1998). Most
categorical of all is EEOC's conclusion that "an individual
who has HIV infection (including asymptomatic HIV infection) is an individual with a disability." EEOC Interpretive
Manual $ 902.4(c)(1), p. 902-21; accord, id., $ 902.2(d), p. 902-
14, n. 18. In the EEOC's view, "impairments . . . such as
HIV infection, are inherently substantially limiting." 29
CFR pt. 1630, App., p. 350 (1997); EEOC Technical Assistance Manual II-4; EEOC Interpretive Manual $ 902.4(c)(1),
p. 902-21.

The regulatory authorities we cite are consistent with our
holding that HIV infection, even in the so-called asymptomatic phase, is an impairment which substantially limits the
major life activity of reproduction.

648 BRAGDON v. ABBOTT

Opinion of the Court

III
The petition for certiorari presented three other questionsfor review. The questions stated:

"3. When deciding under title III of the ADA whethera private health care provider must perform invasive
procedures on an infectious patient in his office, shouldcourts defer to the health care provider's professional
judgment, as long as it is reasonable in light of then-current medical knowledge?

"4. What is the proper standard of judicial reviewunder title III of the ADA of a private health care provider's judgment that the performance of certain inva-sive procedures in his office would pose a direct threat
to the health or safety of others?"5. Did petitioner, Randon Bragdon, D. M. D., raise a
genuine issue of fact for trial as to whether he was war-ranted in his judgment that the performance of certain
invasive procedures on a patient in his office would haveposed a direct threat to the health or safety of others?"
Pet. for Cert. i.
Of these, we granted certiorari only on question three. Thequestion is phrased in an awkward way, for it conflates two

separate inquiries. In asking whether it is appropriate todefer to petitioner's judgment, it assumes that petitioner's
assessment of the objective facts was reasonable. The cen-tral premise of the question and the assumption on which it
is based merit separate consideration.Again, we begin with the statute. Notwithstanding the
protection given respondent by the ADA's definition of dis-ability, petitioner could have refused to treat her if her infectious condition "pose[d] a direct threat to the health or safetyof others." 42 U. S. C. $ 12182(b)(3). The ADA defines a direct threat to be "a significant risk to the health or safety ofothers that cannot be eliminated by a modification of policies,
practices, or procedures or by the provision of auxiliary aids

Opinion of the Court
or services." Ibid. Parallel provisions appear in the em-ployment provisions of Title I. $$ 12111(3), 12113(b).

The ADA's direct threat provision stems from the recogni-tion in

School Bd. of Nassau Cty. v. Arline, 480 U. S. 273,
287 (1987), of the importance of prohibiting discrimination
against individuals with disabilities while protecting othersfrom significant health and safety risks, resulting, for instance, from a contagious disease. In Arline, the Court rec-onciled these objectives by construing the Rehabilitation Act
not to require the hiring of a person who posed "a significantrisk of communicating an infectious disease to others."

Id.,
at 287, n. 16. Congress amended the Rehabilitation Act and
the Fair Housing Act to incorporate the language. See 29
U. S. C. $ 706(8)(D) (excluding individuals who "would constitute a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals"); 42 U. S. C. $ 3604(f )(9) (same). It later relied on the
same language in enacting the ADA. See 28 CFR pt. 36,
App. B, p. 626 (1997) (ADA's direct threat provision codifies
Arline). Because few, if any, activities in life are risk free,
Arline and the ADA do not ask whether a risk exists, but
whether it is significant. Arline, supra, at 287, and n. 16; 42
U. S. C. $ 12182(b)(3).

The existence, or nonexistence, of a significant risk must
be determined from the standpoint of the person who refuses
the treatment or accommodation, and the risk assessment
must be based on medical or other objective evidence. Arline, supra, at 288; 28 CFR $ 36.208(c) (1997); id., pt. 36, App.
B, p. 626. As a health care professional, petitioner had the
duty to assess the risk of infection based on the objective,
scientific information available to him and others in his profession. His belief that a significant risk existed, even if
maintained in good faith, would not relieve him from liability.
To use the words of the question presented, petitioner receives no special deference simply because he is a health care
professional. It is true that Arline reserved "the question
whether courts should also defer to the reasonable medical

524US2 Unit: $U96 [09-15-00 14:39:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN
650 BRAGDON v. ABBOTT

Opinion of the Court
judgments of private physicians on which an employer hasrelied." 480 U. S., at 288, n. 18. At most, this statement

reserved the possibility that employers could consult withindividual physicians as objective third-party experts. It
did not suggest that an individual physician's state of mind
could excuse discrimination without regard to the objectivereasonableness of his actions.

Our conclusion that courts should assess the objective rea-sonableness of the views of health care professionals without
deferring to their individual judgments does not answer theimplicit assumption in the question presented, whether petitioner's actions were reasonable in light of the available medical evidence. In assessing the reasonableness of petitioner's actions, the views of public health authorities, such as
the U. S. Public Health Service, CDC, and the National Institutes of Health, are of special weight and authority. Arline,
supra, at 288; 28 CFR pt. 36, App. B, p. 626 (1997). The
views of these organizations are not conclusive, however. A
health care professional who disagrees with the prevailing
medical consensus may refute it by citing a credible scientific
basis for deviating from the accepted norm. See W. Keeton,
D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on
Law of Torts $ 32, p. 187 (5th ed. 1984).

We have reviewed so much of the record as necessary to
illustrate the application of the rule to the facts of this case.
For the most part, the Court of Appeals followed the proper
standard in evaluating petitioner's position and conducted a
thorough review of the evidence. Its rejection of the District Court's reliance on the Marianos affidavits was a correct
application of the principle that petitioner's actions must be
evaluated in light of the available, objective evidence. The
record did not show that CDC had published the conclusion
set out in the affidavits at the time petitioner refused to treat
respondent. 107 F. 3d, at 946, n. 7.

A further illustration of a correct application of the objective standard is the Court of Appeals' refusal to give weight

524US2 Unit: $U96 [09-15-00 14:39:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN

651Cite as: 524 U. S. 624 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
to petitioner's offer to treat respondent in a hospital. Id.,
at 943, n. 4. Petitioner testified that he believed hospitals
had safety measures, such as air filtration, ultraviolet lights,
and respirators, which would reduce the risk of HIV transmission. App. 151. Petitioner made no showing, however,
that any area hospital had these safeguards or even that he
had hospital privileges. Id., at 31. His expert also admitted the lack of any scientific basis for the conclusion that
these measures would lower the risk of transmission. Id.,
at 209. Petitioner failed to present any objective, medical
evidence showing that treating respondent in a hospital
would be safer or more efficient in preventing HIV transmission than treatment in a well-equipped dental office.

We are concerned, however, that the Court of Appeals
might have placed mistaken reliance upon two other sources.
In ruling no triable issue of fact existed on this point, the
Court of Appeals relied on the 1993 CDC Dentistry Guidelines and the 1991 American Dental Association Policy on
HIV. 107 F. 3d, at 945-946. This evidence is not definitive.
As noted earlier, the CDC Guidelines recommended certain
universal precautions which, in CDC's view, "should reduce
the risk of disease transmission in the dental environment."
U. S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, Public Health
Service, CDC, Recommended Infection-Control Practices
for Dentistry, 41 Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Rep.
No. RR-8, p. 1 (May 28, 1993). The Court of Appeals determined that, "[w]hile the guidelines do not state explicitly
that no further risk-reduction measures are desirable or that
routine dental care for HIV-positive individuals is safe, those
two conclusions seem to be implicit in the guidelines' detailed
delineation of procedures for office treatment of HIV-positive
patients." 107 F. 3d, at 946. In our view, the Guidelines do
not necessarily contain implicit assumptions conclusive of the
point to be decided. The Guidelines set out CDC's recommendation that the universal precautions are the best way

652 BRAGDON v. ABBOTT

Opinion of the Court
to combat the risk of HIV transmission. They do not assessthe level of risk.

Nor can we be certain, on this record, whether the 1991American Dental Association Policy on HIV carries the
weight the Court of Appeals attributed to it. The Policy
does provide some evidence of the medical community'sobjective assessment of the risks posed by treating people

infected with HIV in dental offices. It indicates:

"Current scientific and epidemiologic evidence indicatesthat there is little risk of transmission of infectious

diseases through dental treatment if recommended infection control procedures are routinely followed. Pa-tients with HIV infection may be safely treated in private dental offices when appropriate infection controlprocedures are employed. Such infection control procedures provide protection both for patients and dentalpersonnel." App. 225.

We note, however, that the Association is a professional or-ganization, which, although a respected source of information
on the dental profession, is not a public health authority. Itis not clear the extent to which the Policy was based on the
Association's assessment of dentists' ethical and professionalduties in addition to its scientific assessment of the risk to
which the ADA refers. Efforts to clarify dentists' ethical
obligations and to encourage dentists to treat patients withHIV infection with compassion may be commendable, but

the question under the statute is one of statistical likelihood,not professional responsibility. Without more information
on the manner in which the American Dental Association
formulated this Policy, we are unable to determine the Policy's value in evaluating whether petitioner's assessment of
the risks was reasonable as a matter of law.

The court considered materials submitted by both parties
on the cross-motions for summary judgment. The petitioner was required to establish that there existed a genuine

Opinion of the Court
issue of material fact. Evidence which was merely colorableor not significantly probative would not have been sufficient.

Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U. S. 242, 249-250(1986).

We acknowledge the presence of other evidence in the record before the Court of Appeals which, subject to furtherarguments and examination, might support affirmance of the

trial court's ruling. For instance, the record contains sub-stantial testimony from numerous health experts indicating
that it is safe to treat patients infected with HIV in dentaloffices. App. 66-68, 88-90, 264-266, 268. We are unable to
determine the import of this evidence, however. The record
does not disclose whether the expert testimony submitted by
respondent turned on evidence available in September 1994.
See id., at 69-70 (expert testimony relied in part on materials published after September 1994).

There are reasons to doubt whether petitioner advanced
evidence sufficient to raise a triable issue of fact on the
significance of the risk. Petitioner relied on two principal
points: First, he asserted that the use of high-speed drills
and surface cooling with water created a risk of airborne
HIV transmission. The study on which petitioner relied
was inconclusive, however, determining only that "[f]urther
work is required to determine whether such a risk exists."
Johnson & Robinson, Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1
(HIV-1) in the Vapors of Surgical Power Instruments, 33 J.
of Medical Virology 47 (1991). Petitioner's expert witness
conceded, moreover, that no evidence suggested the spray
could transmit HIV. His opinion on airborne risk was based
on the absence of contrary evidence, not on positive data.
App. 166. Scientific evidence and expert testimony must
have a traceable, analytical basis in objective fact before it
may be considered on summary judgment. See General
Electric Co. v. Joiner, 522 U. S. 136, 144-145, 146 (1997).

Second, petitioner argues that, as of September 1994, CDC
had identified seven dental workers with possible occupa524US2 Unit: $U96 [09-15-00 14:39:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN

tional transmission of HIV. See U. S. Dept. of Health andHuman Services, Public Health Service, CDC, HIV/AIDS

Surveillance Report, vol. 6, no. 1, p. 15, tbl. 11 (Mid-year ed.June 1994). These dental workers were exposed to HIV in
the course of their employment, but CDC could not determine whether HIV infection had resulted from this expo-sure.

Id., at 15, n. 3. It is now known that CDC could not
ascertain how the seven dental workers contracted the dis-ease because they did not present themselves for HIV testing at an appropriate time after this occupational exposure.Gooch et al., Percutaneous Exposures to HIV-Infected Blood
Among Dental Workers Enrolled in the CDC Needlestick
Study, 126 J. American Dental Assn. 1237, 1239 (1995). It is
not clear on this record, however, whether this information
was available to petitioner in September 1994. If not, the
seven cases might have provided some, albeit not necessarily
sufficient, support for petitioner's position. Standing alone,
we doubt it would meet the objective, scientific basis for
finding a significant risk to the petitioner.

Our evaluation of the evidence is constrained by the fact
that on these and other points we have not had briefs and
arguments directed to the entire record. In accepting the
case for review, we declined to grant certiorari on question
five, which asked whether petitioner raised a genuine issue
of fact for trial. Pet. for Cert. i. As a result, the briefs and
arguments presented to us did not concentrate on the question of sufficiency in light all of the submissions in the summary judgment proceeding. "When attention has been focused on other issues, or when the court from which a case
comes has expressed no views on a controlling question, it
may be appropriate to remand the case rather than deal with
the merits of that question in this Court." Dandridge v.
Williams, 397 U. S. 471, 476, n. 6 (1970). This consideration
carries particular force where, as here, full briefing directed
at the issue would help place a complex factual record in
proper perspective. Resolution of the issue will be of im524US2 Unit: $U96 [09-15-00 14:39:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN

portance to health care workers not just for the result butalso for the precision and comprehensiveness of the reasons

given for the decision.We conclude the proper course is to give the Court of Appeals the opportunity to determine whether our analysis ofsome of the studies cited by the parties would change its
conclusion that petitioner presented neither objective evi-dence nor a triable issue of fact on the question of risk. In
remanding the case, we do not foreclose the possibility thatthe Court of Appeals may reach the same conclusion it did
earlier. A remand will permit a full exploration of the issuethrough the adversary process.

The determination of the Court of Appeals that respond-ent's HIV infection was a disability under the ADA is affirmed. The judgment is vacated, and the case is remandedfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.
Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Breyer joins,concurring.

The Court's opinion demonstrates that respondent's HIVinfection easily falls within the statute's definition of "disability." Moreover, the Court's discussion in Part III of the rel-evant evidence has persuaded me that the judgment of the
Court of Appeals should be affirmed. I do not believe peti-tioner has sustained his burden of adducing evidence sufficient to raise a triable issue of fact on the significance of therisk posed by treating respondent in his office. The Court
of Appeals reached that conclusion after a careful and extensive study of the record; its analysis on this question wasperfectly consistent with the legal reasoning in

Justice
Kennedy's opinion for the Court; and the latter opinionitself explains that petitioner relied on data that were inconclusive and speculative at best, see ante, at 653-654.Cf.

There are not, however, five Justices who agree that thejudgment should be affirmed. Nor does it appear that there

are five Justices who favor a remand for further proceedingsconsistent with the views expressed in either

Justice Kennedy's opinion for the Court or the opinion of The Chief
Justice. Because I am in agreement with the legal analy-sis in

Justice Kennedy's opinion, in order to provide a
judgment supported by a majority, I join that opinion eventhough I would prefer an outright affirmance. Cf.

Screws v.
United States, 325 U. S. 91, 134 (1945) (Rutledge, J., concur-ring in result).

Justice Ginsburg, concurring.
Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection, as the de-scription set out in the Court's opinion documents,

ante, at
635-637, has been regarded as a disease limiting life itself.
See Brief for American Medical Association as Amicus Curiae 20. The disease inevitably pervades life's choices: education, employment, family and financial undertakings. It
affects the need for and, as this case shows, the ability to
obtain health care because of the reaction of others to the
impairment. No rational legislator, it seems to me apparent, would require nondiscrimination once symptoms become
visible but permit discrimination when the disease, though
present, is not yet visible. I am therefore satisfied that the
statutory and regulatory definitions are well met. HIV infection is "a physical . . . impairment that substantially limits
. . . major life activities," or is so perceived, 42 U. S. C.

$$ 12102(2)(A), (C), including the afflicted individual's family
relations, employment potential, and ability to care for herself, see 45 CFR $ 84.3( j)(2)(ii) (1997); 28 CFR $ 41.31(b)(2)
(1997).

I further agree, in view of the "importance [of the issue]
to health care workers," ante, at 654-655, that it is wise to
remand, erring, if at all, on the side of caution. By taking
this course, the Court ensures a fully informed determina524US2 Unit: $U96 [09-15-00 14:39:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN

tion whether respondent Abbott's disease posed "a signifi-cant risk to the health or safety of [petitioner Bragdon] that

[could not] be eliminated by a modification of policies, prac-tices, or procedures . . . ." 42 U. S. C. $ 12182(b)(3).

Chief Justice Rehnquist, with whom Justice Scaliaand

Justice Thomas join, and with whom Justice O'Connor joins as to Part II, concurring in the judgment in partand dissenting in part.

I
Is respondent Abbott (hereinafter respondent)--who hastested positive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)

but was asymptomatic at the time she suffered discrimina-tory treatment--a person with a "disability" as that term
is defined in the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990(ADA)? The term "disability" is defined in the ADA to
include:

"(A) a physical or mental impairment that substan-tially limits one or more of the major life activities of

such individual;"(B) a record of such an impairment; or

"(C) being regarded as having such an impairment."42 U. S. C. $ 12102(2).

It is important to note that whether respondent has a dis-ability covered by the ADA is an individualized inquiry.
The Act could not be clearer on this point: Section 12102(2)states explicitly that the disability determination must be
made "with respect to an individual." Were this not suffi-ciently clear, the Act goes on to provide that the "major life
activities" allegedly limited by an impairment must be those"of such individual." $ 12102(2)(A).

The individualized nature of the inquiry is particularly im-portant in this case because the District Court disposed of it
on summary judgment. Thus all disputed issues of materialfact must be resolved against respondent. She contends

that her asymptomatic HIV status brings her within the firstdefinition of a "disability."

1 She must therefore demonstrate, inter alia, that she was (1) physically or mentallyimpaired and that such impairment (2) substantially limited

(3) one or more of her major life activities.Petitioner does not dispute that asymptomatic HIVpositive status is a physical impairment. I therefore assumethis to be the case, and proceed to the second and third statutory requirements for "disability."According to the Court, the next question is "whether
reproduction is a major life activity." Ante, at 638. That,however, is only half of the relevant question. As mentioned above, the ADA's definition of a "disability" requiresthat the major life activity at issue be one "of such individual." $ 12102(2)(A). The Court truncates the question,perhaps because there is not a shred of record evidence indicating that, prior to becoming infected with HIV, respond-ent's major life activities included reproduction

she is "regarded as" such. 42 U. S. C. $ 12102(2)(C). We did not, however, grant certiorari on that question. While respondent can advance
arguments not within the question presented in support of the judgment
below, Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston, 469 U. S. 111, 119, n. 14
(1985); Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U. S. 471, 475, n. 6 (1970), we have
rarely addressed arguments not asserted below. It was the United
States, not respondent, that asserted the "regarded as" argument below.
The Court of Appeals declined to address it, as should we.

In any event, the "regarded as" prong requires a plaintiff to demonstrate that the defendant regarded him as having "such an impairment"
(i. e., one that substantially limits a major life activity). 42 U. S. C.

$ 12102(2)(C) (emphasis added). Respondent has offered no evidence to
support the assertion that petitioner regarded her as having an impairment that substantially limited her ability to reproduce, as opposed to
viewing her as simply impaired.

2 Calling reproduction a major life activity is somewhat inartful. Reproduction is not an activity at all, but a process. One could be described
as breathing, walking, or performing manual tasks, but a human being (as
opposed to a copier machine or a gremlin) would never be described as
reproducing. I assume that in using the term reproduction, respondent
and the Court are referring to the numerous discrete activities that com524US2 Unit: $U96 [09-15-00 14:39:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.
for the moment that reproduction is a major life activity atall). At most, the record indicates that after learning of her

HIV status, respondent, whatever her previous inclination,conclusively decided that she would not have children. App.
14. There is absolutely no evidence that, absent the HIV,
respondent would have had or was even considering hav-ing children. Indeed, when asked during her deposition

whether her HIV infection had in any way impaired her ability to carry out any of her life functions, respondent answered "No." Ibid. It is further telling that in the course
of her entire brief to this Court, respondent studiously
avoids asserting even once that reproduction is a major life
activity to her. To the contrary, she argues that the "major
life activity" inquiry should not turn on a particularized
assessment of the circumstances of this or any other case.
Brief for Respondent Abbott 30-31.

But even aside from the facts of this particular case, the
Court is simply wrong in concluding as a general matter that
reproduction is a "major life activity." Unfortunately, the
ADA does not define the phrase "major life activities." But
the Act does incorporate by reference a list of such activities
contained in regulations issued under the Rehabilitation Act.
42 U. S. C. $ 12201(a); 45 CFR $ 84.3( j)(2)(ii) (1997). The
Court correctly recognizes that this list of major life activities "is illustrative, not exhaustive," ante, at 639, but then
makes no attempt to demonstrate that reproduction is a
major life activity in the same sense that "caring for one's
self, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing,
speaking, breathing, learning, and working" are. Ante, at
638-639.

Instead, the Court argues that reproduction is a "major"
life activity in that it is "central to the life process itself."
Ante, at 638. In support of this reading, the Court focuses
on the fact that " `major' " indicates " `comparative imporprise the reproductive process, and that is the sense in which I have used
the term.

tance,' " ibid.; see also Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 702(10th ed. 1994) ("greater in dignity, rank, importance, or interest"), ignoring the alternative definition of "major" as"greater in quantity, number, or extent,"

ibid. It is the latter definition that is most consistent with the ADA's illustrative list of major life activities.No one can deny that reproductive decisions are important

in a person's life. But so are decisions as to who to marry,where to live, and how to earn one's living. Fundamental
importance of this sort is not the common thread linking thestatute's listed activities. The common thread is rather that
the activities are repetitively performed and essential in theday-to-day existence of a normally functioning individual.
They are thus quite different from the series of activities
leading to the birth of a child.

Both respondent, Brief for Respondent Abbott 20, n. 24,
and the Government, Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 13, argue that reproduction must be a major life activity
because regulations issued under the ADA define the term
"physical impairment" to include physiological disorders affecting the reproductive system. 28 CFR $ 36.104 (1997).
If reproduction were not a major life activity, they argue,
then it would have made little sense to include the reproductive disorders in the roster of physical impairments. This
argument is simply wrong. There are numerous disorders
of the reproductive system, such as dysmenorrhea and endometriosis, which are so painful that they limit a woman's ability to engage in major life activities such as walking and
working. And, obviously, cancer of the various reproductive
organs limits one's ability to engage in numerous activities
other than reproduction.

But even if I were to assume that reproduction is a major
life activity of respondent, I do not agree that an asymptomatic HIV infection "substantially limits" that activity. The
record before us leaves no doubt that those so infected are
still entirely able to engage in sexual intercourse, give birth

Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.
to a child if they become pregnant, and perform the manual
tasks necessary to rear a child to maturity. See App. 53-54.
While individuals infected with HIV may choose not to engage in these activities, there is no support in language,
logic, or our case law for the proposition that such voluntary
choices constitute a "limit" on one's own life activities.

The Court responds that the ADA "addresses substantial
limitations on major life activities, not utter inabilities."
Ante, at 641. I agree, but fail to see how this assists the
Court's cause. Apart from being unable to demonstrate that
she is utterly unable to engage in the various activities that
comprise the reproductive process, respondent has not even
explained how she is less able to engage in those activities.

Respondent contends that her ability to reproduce is limited because "the fatal nature of HIV infection means that a
parent is unlikely to live long enough to raise and nurture
the child to adulthood." Brief for Respondent Abbott 22.
But the ADA's definition of a disability is met only if the
alleged impairment substantially "limits" (present tense)
a major life activity. 42 U. S. C. $ 12102(2)(A). Asymptomatic HIV does not presently limit respondent's ability to
perform any of the tasks necessary to bear or raise a child.
Respondent's argument, taken to its logical extreme, would
render every individual with a genetic marker for some debilitating disease "disabled" here and now because of some
possible future effects.

In my view, therefore, respondent has failed to demonstrate that any of her major life activities were substantially
limited by her HIV infection.

II
While the Court concludes to the contrary as to the "disability" issue, it then quite correctly recognizes that petitioner could nonetheless have refused to treat respondent if
her condition posed a "direct threat." The Court of Appeals

524US2 Unit: $U96 [09-15-00 14:39:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN
662 BRAGDON v. ABBOTT

Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.
affirmed the judgment of the District Court granting sum-mary judgment to respondent on this issue. The Court vacates this portion of the Court of Appeals' decision, and re-mands the case to the lower court, presumably so that it may
"determine whether our analysis of some of the studies cited
by the parties would change its conclusion that petitionerpresented neither objective evidence nor a triable issue of

fact on the question of risk." Ante, at 655. I agree thatthe judgment should be vacated, although I am not sure I
understand the Court's cryptic direction to the lower court."[D]irect threat" is defined as a "significant risk to the
health or safety of others that cannot be eliminated by amodification of policies, practices, or procedures or by the
provision of auxiliary aids or services." $ 12182(b)(3). This
statutory definition of a direct threat consists of two parts.First, a court must ask whether treating the infected patient

without precautionary techniques would pose a "significantrisk to the health or safety of others."

Ibid. Whether a
particular risk is significant depends on:

" `(a) the nature of the risk (how the disease is transmitted), (b) the duration of the risk (how long is the carrierinfectious), (c) the severity of the risk (what is the potential harm to third parties) and (d) the probabilities thedisease will be transmitted and will cause varying degrees of harm.' " School Bd. of Nassau Cty. v. Arline,480 U. S. 273, 288 (1987).

Even if a significant risk exists, a health practitioner will stillbe required to treat the infected patient if "a modification
of policies, practices, or procedures" (in this case, universal
precautions) will "eliminat[e]" the risk. $ 12182(b)(3).

I agree with the Court that "[t]he existence, or nonexistence, of a significant risk must be determined from the standpoint of the person who refuses the treatment or accommodation," as of the time that the decision refusing treatment is
made. Ante, at 649. I disagree with the Court, however,

524US2 Unit: $U96 [09-15-00 14:39:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN

663Cite as: 524 U. S. 624 (1998)
Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.
that "[i]n assessing the reasonableness of petitioner's actions,the views of public health authorities . . . are of special

weight and authority." Ante, at 650. Those views are, ofcourse, entitled to a presumption of validity when the actions
of those authorities themselves are challenged in court, and
even in disputes between private parties where Congresshas committed that dispute to adjudication by a public health

authority. But in litigation between private parties origi-nating in the federal courts, I am aware of no provision of
law or judicial practice that would require or permit courtsto give some scientific views more credence than others simply because they have been endorsed by a politically appointed public health authority (such as the Surgeon General). In litigation of this latter sort, which is what we face
here, the credentials of the scientists employed by the public
health authority, and the soundness of their studies, must
stand on their own. The Court cites no authority for its
limitation upon the courts' truth-finding function, except the
statement in School Bd. of Nassau Cty. v. Arline, 480 U. S.,
at 288, that in making findings regarding the risk of contagion under the Rehabilitation Act, "courts normally should
defer to the reasonable medical judgments of public health
officials." But there is appended to that dictum the following footnote, which makes it very clear that the Court was
urging respect for medical judgment, and not necessarily
respect for "official" medical judgment over "private" medical judgment: "This case does not present, and we do not
address, the question whether courts should also defer to the
reasonable medical judgments of private physicians on which
an employer has relied." Id., at 288, n. 18.

Applying these principles here, it is clear to me that petitioner has presented more than enough evidence to avoid
summary judgment on the "direct threat" question. In June
1994, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a study identifying seven instances of possible transmission of HIV from patients to dental workers. See ante,

524US2 Unit: $U96 [09-15-00 14:39:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN
664 BRAGDON v. ABBOTT

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
at 654. While it is not entirely certain whether these dentalworkers contracted HIV during the course of providing dental treatment, the potential that the disease was transmittedduring the course of dental treatment is relevant evidence.
One need only demonstrate "risk," not certainty of infection.
See Arline, supra, at 288 (" `[T]he probabilities the diseasewill be transmitted' " is a factor in assessing risk). Given

the "severity of the risk" involved here, i. e., near certaindeath, and the fact that no public health authority had outlined a protocol for eliminating this risk in the context ofroutine dental treatment, it seems likely that petitioner can
establish that it was objectively reasonable for him to con-clude that treating respondent in his office posed a "direct
threat" to his safety.

In addition, petitioner offered evidence of 42 documented
incidents of occupational transmission of HIV to health care
workers other than dental professionals. App. 106. The
Court of Appeals dismissed this evidence as irrelevant because these health professionals were not dentists. 107
F. 3d 934, 947 (CA1 1997). But the fact that the health care
workers were not dentists is no more valid a basis for distinguishing these transmissions of HIV than the fact that the
health care workers did not practice in Maine. At a minimum, petitioner's evidence was sufficient to create a triable
issue on this question, and summary judgment was accordingly not appropriate.

Justice O'Connor, concurring in the judgment in part
and dissenting in part.

I agree with The Chief Justice that respondent's claim
of disability should be evaluated on an individualized basis
and that she has not proved that her asymptomatic HIV status substantially limited one or more of her major life activities. In my view, the act of giving birth to a child, while a
very important part of the lives of many women, is not generally the same as the representative major life activities of

all persons--"caring for one's self, performing manual tasks,walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, and

working"--listed in regulations relevant to the Americanswith Disabilities Act of 1990. See 45 CFR $ 84.3( j)(2)(ii)
(1997); 28 CFR $ 41.31(b)(2) (1997). Based on that conclu-sion, there is no need to address whether other aspects of
intimate or family relationships not raised in this case couldconstitute major life activities; nor is there reason to consider whether HIV status would impose a substantial limita-tion on one's ability to reproduce if reproduction were a
major life activity.I join in Part II of

The Chief Justice's opinion concur-ring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part, which

concludes that the Court of Appeals failed to properly deter-mine whether respondent's condition posed a direct threat.
Accordingly, I agree that a remand is necessary on that issue.

UNITED STATES v. BALSYS
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe second circuit

No. 97-873. Argued April 20, 1998--Decided June 25, 1998
When the Office of Special Investigations of the Department of Justice's

Criminal Division (OSI) subpoenaed respondent Balsys, a resident alien,
to testify about his wartime activities between 1940 and 1944 and his
immigration to the United States, he claimed the Fifth Amendment
privilege against self-incrimination, based on his fear of prosecution by
a foreign nation. The Federal District Court granted OSI's petition to
enforce the subpoena, but the Second Circuit vacated the order, holding
that a witness with a real and substantial fear of prosecution by a foreign country may assert the privilege to avoid giving testimony in a
domestic proceeding, even if the witness has no valid fear of a criminal
prosecution in this country.

Held: Concern with foreign prosecution is beyond the scope of the SelfIncrimination Clause. Pp. 671-700.

(a) As a resident alien, Balsys is a "person" who, under that Clause,
cannot "be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself." See Kwong Hai Chew v. Colding, 344 U. S. 590, 596. However,
the question here is whether a criminal prosecution by a foreign government not subject to this country's constitutional guarantees presents a
"criminal case" for purposes of the privilege. Pp. 671-672.

(b) Balsys initially relies on the textual contrast between the Sixth
Amendment, which clearly applies only to domestic criminal proceedings, and the Fifth, with its broader reference to "any criminal case,"
to argue that "any criminal case" means exactly that, regardless of the
prosecuting authority. But the argument overlooks the cardinal rule
to construe provisions in context. See King v. St. Vincent's Hospital,
502 U. S. 215, 221. Because none of the other provisions of the Fifth
Amendment is implicated except by action of the government that it
binds, it would have been strange to choose such associates for a Clause
meant to take a broader view. Further, a more modest understanding,
that "any criminal case" distinguishes the Fifth Amendment's SelfIncrimination Clause from its Clause limiting grand jury indictments to
"capital, or otherwise infamous crime[s]," provides an explanation for
the text of the privilege. Indeed, there is no known clear common-law
precedent or practice, contemporaneous with the framing, for looking to

667Cite as: 524 U. S. 666 (1998)
Syllabus
the possibility of foreign prosecution as a premise for claiming the privilege. Pp. 672-674.

(c) In the precursors of this case, the Court concluded that prosecution in a state jurisdiction not bound by the Self-Incrimination Clause
is beyond the purview of the privilege. United States v. Murdock, 284
U. S. 141. United States v. Saline Bank of Va., 1 Pet. 100, and Ballmann v. Fagin, 200 U. S. 186, distinguished. The Court's precedent
turned away from this proposition once, in Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U. S.
1, 3, where it applied the Fourteenth Amendment due process incorporation to the Self-Incrimination Clause, so as to bind the States as well as
the National Government by its terms. It immediately said, in Murphy
v. Waterfront Comm'n of N. Y. Harbor, 378 U. S. 52, 57, that Malloy
necessitated a reconsideration of Murdock's rule. After Malloy, the
Fifth Amendment limitation was no longer framed for one jurisdiction
alone, each jurisdiction having instead become subject to the same privilege claim flowing from the same source. Since fear of prosecution in
the one jurisdiction now implicated the very privilege binding upon the
other, the Murphy opinion sensibly recognized that if a witness could
not assert the privilege in such circumstances, the witness could be
"whipsawed" into incriminating himself under both state and federal
law, even though the privilege was applicable to each. Such whipsawing is possible because the privilege against self-incrimination can be
exchanged by the government for an immunity to prosecutorial use of
any compelled inculpatory testimony. Kastigar v. United States, 406
U. S. 441, 448-449. Such an exchange by the government is permissible
only when it provides immunity as broad as the privilege. After Malloy had held the privilege binding on the state jurisdictions as well
as the National Government, it would have been intolerable to allow a
prosecutor in one or the other jurisdiction to eliminate the privilege by
offering immunity less complete than the privilege's dual jurisdictional
reach. To the extent that the Murphy Court undercut Murdock's rationale on historical grounds, its reasoning that English cases supported
a more expansive reading of the Clause is flawed and cannot be accepted
now. Pp. 674-690.

(d) Murphy discusses a catalog of "Policies of the Privilege," which
could suggest a concern broad enough to encompass foreign prosecutions. However, the adoption of such a revised theory would rest on
Murphy's treatment of English cases, which has been rejected as an
indication of the Clause's meaning. Moreover, although Murphy catalogs aspirations furthered by the Clause, its discussion does not weigh
the host of competing policy concerns that would be raised in a legitimate reconsideration of the Clause's scope. Contrary to Balsys's

668 UNITED STATES v. BALSYS

Syllabus
contention, general personal testimonial integrity or privacy is not a
reliable guide to the Clause's scope of protection. Fifth Amendment
tradition offers, in practice, a conditional protection of testimonial privacy. Since the judiciary could not recognize fear of foreign prosecution and at the same time preserve the Government's existing rights to
seek testimony in exchange for immunity (because domestic courts could
not enforce the immunity abroad), extending the privilege would change
the balance of private and governmental interests that has been accepted for as long as there has been Fifth Amendment doctrine. Balsys
also argues that Murphy's policy catalog supports application of the
privilege in order to prevent the Government from overreaching to facilitate foreign criminal prosecutions in a spirit of "cooperative internationalism." Murphy recognized "cooperative federalism"--the teamwork of state and national officials to fight interstate crime--but only
to underscore the significance of the Court's holding that a federal court
could no longer ignore fear of state prosecution when ruling on a privilege claim. Since in this case there is no counterpart to Malloy, imposing the Fifth Amendment beyond the National Government, there is no
premise in Murphy for appealing to "cooperative internationalism" by
analogy to "cooperative federalism." The analogy must, instead, be to
the pre-Murphy era when the States were not bound by the privilege.
Even if "cooperative federalism" and "cooperative internationalism" did
support expanding the privilege's scope, Balsys has not shown that the
likely costs and benefits justify such expansion. Cooperative conduct
between the United States and foreign nations may one day develop to
a point at which fear of foreign prosecution could be recognized under
the Clause as traditionally understood, but Balsys has presented no interest rising to such a level of cooperative prosecution. Pp. 690-700.

respondent.*

Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court.#
By administrative subpoena, the Office of Special Investigations of the Criminal Division of the United States Department of Justice (OSI) sought testimony from the respondent,
Aloyzas Balsys, about his wartime activities between 1940
and 1944 and his immigration to the United States in 1961.
Balsys declined to answer such questions, claiming the Fifth
Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, based on
his fear of prosecution by a foreign nation. We hold that
concern with foreign prosecution is beyond the scope of the
Self-Incrimination Clause.

I

Respondent Aloyzas Balsys is a resident alien living in
Woodhaven, New York, having obtained admission to this
country in 1961 under the Immigration and Nationality Act,
8 U. S. C. $ 1201, on an immigrant visa and alien registration
issued at the American Consulate in Liverpool. In his application, he said that he had served in the Lithuanian army
between 1934 and 1940, and had lived in hiding in Plateliai,
Lithuania, between 1940 and 1944. Balsys swore that the
information was true, and signed a statement of understanding that if his application contained any false information
or materially misleading statements, or concealed any material fact, he would be subject to criminal prosecution and
deportation.

670 UNITED STATES v. BALSYS

Opinion of the Court
OSI, which was created to institute denaturalization anddeportation proceedings against suspected Nazi war criminals, is now investigating whether, contrary to his repre-sentations, Balsys participated in Nazi persecution during
World War II. Such activity would subject him to deporta-tion for persecuting persons because of their race, religion,
national origin, or political opinion under $$ 1182(a)(3)(E) and1251(a)(4)(D), as well as for lying on his visa application
under $$ 1182(a)(6)(C)(i) and 1251(a)(1)(A).When OSI issued a subpoena requiring Balsys to testify
at a deposition, he appeared and gave his name and address,but he refused to answer any other questions, such as those
directed to his wartime activities in Europe between 1940-1945 and his immigration to the United States in 1961. In
response to all such questions, Balsys invoked the FifthAmendment privilege against compelled self-incrimination,
claiming that his answers could subject him to criminalprosecution. He did not contend that he would incriminate
himself under domestic law,1 but claimed the privilege be-cause his responses could subject him to criminal prosecution
by Lithuania, Israel, and Germany.OSI responded with a petition in Federal District Court to
enforce the subpoena under $ 1225(a). Although the DistrictCourt found that if Balsys were to provide the information
requested, he would face a real and substantial danger ofprosecution by Lithuania and Israel (but not by Germany),
it granted OSI's enforcement petition and ordered Balsys totestify, treating the Fifth Amendment as inapplicable to a
claim of incrimination solely under foreign law. 918 F. Supp.588 (EDNY 1996). Balsys appealed, and the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated the District Court'sorder, holding that a witness with a real and substantial fear
of prosecution by a foreign country may assert the FifthAmendment privilege to avoid giving testimony in a domes1 The Government advises us that the statute of limitation bars criminal

II
The Self-Incrimination Clause of the Fifth Amendmentprovides that "[n]o person . . . shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself." U. S. Const.,Amdt. 5. Resident aliens such as Balsys are considered
"persons" for purposes of the Fifth Amendment and are en-titled to the same protections under the Clause as citizens.
See Kwong Hai Chew v. Colding, 344 U. S. 590, 596 (1953).The parties do not dispute that the Government seeks to
"compel" testimony from Balsys that would make him "a wit-ness against himself." The question is whether there is a
risk that Balsys's testimony will be used in a proceeding thatis a "criminal case."

Balsys agrees that the risk that his testimony might sub-ject him to deportation is not a sufficient ground for asserting the privilege, given the civil character of a deportationproceeding. See INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, 468 U. S. 1032,
1038-1039 (1984). If, however, Balsys could demonstrate

2 See United States v. Gecas, 120 F. 3d 1419 (CA11 1997) (en banc) (holding that the privilege cannot be invoked based on fear of prosecution
abroad); United States v. (Under Seal), 794 F. 2d 920 (CA4) (same), cert.

(1970).

We have granted certiorari in cases raising this question twice before
but did not reach its merits in either case. See Zicarelli v. New Jersey
Comm'n of Investigation, 406 U. S. 472 (1972) (finding that because the
petitioner did not face a "real and substantial" risk of foreign prosecution,
it was unnecessary to decide whether the privilege can be asserted based
on fear of foreign prosecution); Parker v. United States, 397 U. S. 96 (1970)

moot).

672 UNITED STATES v. BALSYS

Opinion of the Court
that any testimony he might give in the deportation investi-gation could be used in a criminal proceeding against him

brought by the Government of either the United States orone of the States, he would be entitled to invoke the privilege. It "can be asserted in any proceeding, civil or crimi-nal, administrative or judicial, investigatory or adjudicatory,"
in which the witness reasonably believes that the informa-tion sought, or discoverable as a result of his testimony, could
be used in a subsequent state or federal criminal proceeding.
Kastigar v. United States, 406 U. S. 441, 444-445 (1972); seealso McCarthy v. Arndstein, 266 U. S. 34, 40 (1924) (the privilege "applies alike to civil and criminal proceedings, wher-ever the answer might tend to subject to criminal responsibility him who gives it"). But Balsys makes no such claim,contending rather that his entitlement to invoke the privilege arises because of a real and substantial fear that histestimony could be used against him by Lithuania or Israel
in a criminal prosecution. The reasonableness of his fear isnot challenged by the Government, and we thus squarely
face the question whether a criminal prosecution by a foreigngovernment not subject to our constitutional guarantees presents a "criminal case" for purposes of the privilege againstself-incrimination.

III
Balsys relies in the first instance on the textual contrast
between the Sixth Amendment, which clearly applies onlyto domestic criminal proceedings, and the Compelled SelfIncrimination Clause, with its facially broader referenceto "any criminal case." The same point is developed by
Balsys's amici,3 who argue that "any criminal case" meansexactly that, regardless of the prosecuting authority. According to the argument, the Framers' use of the adjective
"any" precludes recognition of the distinction raised by the

Opinion of the Court
Government, between prosecution by a jurisdiction that isitself bound to recognize the privilege and prosecution by a

foreign jurisdiction that is not. But the argument overlooksthe cardinal rule to construe provisions in context. See
King v. St. Vincent's Hospital, 502 U. S. 215, 221 (1991). Inthe Fifth Amendment context, the Clause in question occurs
in the company of guarantees of grand jury proceedings, de-fense against double jeopardy, due process, and compensation for property taking. Because none of these provisionsis implicated except by action of the government that it
binds, it would have been strange to choose such associatesfor a Clause meant to take a broader view, and it would be
strange to find such a sweep in the Clause now. See Whar-ton v. Wise, 153 U. S. 155, 169-170 (1894) (noscitur a sociis);
see also Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., 513 U. S. 561, 575 (1995)(same). The oddity of such a reading would be especially
stark if the expansive language in question is open to anotherreasonable interpretation, as we think it is. Because the
Fifth Amendment opens by requiring a grand jury indict-ment or presentment "for a capital, or otherwise infamous
crime," 4 the phrase beginning with "any" in the subsequentSelf-Incrimination Clause may sensibly be read as making it
clear that the privilege it provides is not so categoricallylimited. It is plausible to suppose the adjective was inserted only for that purpose, not as taking the further stepof defining the relevant prosecutorial jurisdiction internationally. We therefore take this to be the fair reading ofthe adjective "any," and we read the Clause contextually as

4 As a whole, the Amendment reads as follows: "No person shall be held
to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or
naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or
public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be
twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal
case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or
property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken
for public use, without just compensation."

and because there was no different common law practice atthe time of the framing, see Part III-C, infra; cf. Counselman v. Hitchcock, 142 U. S. 547, 563-564 (1892) (listinga sample of cases, including preframing cases, in which the
privilege was asserted, none of which involve fear of foreignprosecution), there is no reason to disregard the contextual
reading. This Court's precedent has indeed adopted thatso-called same-sovereign interpretation.

no legislative history"); 5 The Founders' Constitution 262 (P. Kurland &
R. Lerner eds. 1987) (indicating that the Clause as originally drafted and
introduced in the First Congress lacked the phrase "any criminal case,"
which was added at the behest of Representative Lawrence on the ground
that the Clause would otherwise be "in some degree contrary to laws
passed").

In recent years, scholarly attention has refined our knowledge of the
previous manifestations of the privilege against self-incrimination, the
present culmination of such scholarship being R. Helmholz et al., The Privilege Against Self-Incrimination (1997). What we know of the circumstances surrounding the adoption of the Fifth Amendment, however, gives
no indication that the Framers had any sense of a privilege more comprehensive than common law practice then revealed. See Moglen, Taking
the Fifth: Reconsidering the Origins of the Constitutional Privilege
Against Self-Incrimination, 92 Mich. L. Rev. 1086, 1123 (1994) ("[T]he legislative history of the Fifth Amendment adds little to our understanding
of the history of the privilege"). As to the common law practice, see Part
III-C, infra.

Opinion of the Court
States, 403 U. S. 713, 716 (1971) (per curiam) (Black, J., con-curring) (emphasis deleted), was expressed early on in Chief

Justice Marshall's opinion for the Court in the leading caseof

Barron ex rel. Tiernan v. Mayor of Baltimore, 7 Pet. 243,
247 (1833): the Constitution's "limitations on power . . . are
naturally, and, we think, necessarily applicable to the gov-ernment created by the instrument," and not to "distinct

[state] governments, framed by different persons and for dif-ferent purposes."

To be sure, it would have been logically possible to decide(as in

Barron) that the "distinct [state] governments . . .
framed . . . for different purposes" were beyond the ambit of
the Fifth Amendment, and at the same time to hold that the
self-incrimination privilege, good against the National Government, was implicated by fear of prosecution in another
jurisdiction. But after Barron and before the era of Fourteenth Amendment incorporation, that would have been an
unlikely doctrinal combination, and no such improbable development occurred.

The precursors of today's case were those raising the question of the significance for the federal privilege of possible
use of testimony in state prosecution. Only a handful of
early cases even touched on the problem. In Brown v.
Walker, 161 U. S. 591 (1896), a witness raised the issue,
claiming the privilege in a federal proceeding based on his
fear of prosecution by a State, but we found that a statute
under which immunity from federal prosecution had been
conferred provided for immunity from state prosecution as
well, obviating any need to reach the issue raised. Id., at
606-608. In Jack v. Kansas, 199 U. S. 372 (1905), a Fourteenth Amendment case, we affirmed a sentence for contempt imposed on a witness in a state proceeding who had
received immunity from state prosecution but refused to answer questions based on a fear that they would subject him
to federal prosecution. Although there was no reasonable
fear of a prosecution by the National Government in that

676 UNITED STATES v. BALSYS

Opinion of the Court
case, we addressed the question whether a self-incriminationprivilege could be invoked in the one jurisdiction based on

fear of prosecution by the other, saying that "[w]e think thelegal immunity is in regard to a prosecution in the same jurisdiction, and when that is fully given it is enough." Id., at382. A year later, in the course of considering whether a
federal witness, immunized from federal prosecution, couldinvoke the privilege based on fear of state prosecution, we
adopted the general proposition that "the possibility that in-formation given by the witness might be used" by the other
government is, as a matter of law, "a danger so unsubstantialand remote" that it fails to trigger the right to invoke the
privilege. Hale v. Henkel, 201 U. S. 43, 69 (1906).

"[I]f the argument were a sound one it might be carriedstill further and held to apply not only to state prosecutions within the same jurisdiction, but to prosecutionsunder the criminal laws of other States to which the
witness might have subjected himself. The questionhas been fully considered in England, and the conclusion
reached by the courts of that country [is] that the onlydanger to be considered is one arising within the same
jurisdiction and under the same sovereignty. Queen v.Boyes, 1 B. & S. 311[, 121 Eng. Rep. 730]; King of the
Two Sicilies v. Willcox, 7 State Trials (N. S.), 1049, 1068;State v. March, 1 Jones (N. Car.), 526; State v. Thomas,
98 N. Car. 599." Ibid.
A holding to this effect came when United States v. Murdock, 284 U. S. 141 (1931), "definitely settled" the questionwhether in a federal proceeding the privilege applied on account of fear of state prosecution, concluding "that one underexamination in a federal tribunal could not refuse to answer
on account of probable incrimination under state law."
United States v. Murdock, 290 U. S. 389, 396 (1933).

Opinion of the Court
the Fifth Amendment rests, does not protect witnessesagainst disclosing offenses in violation of the laws of

another country. King of the Two Sicilies v. Willcox,7 State Trials (N. S.) 1049, 1068. Queen v. Boyes, 1
B. & S., at 330[, 121 Eng. Rep., at 738]. This court hasheld that immunity against state prosecution is not essential to the validity of federal statutes declaring thata witness shall not be excused from giving evidence on
the ground that it will incriminate him, and also thatthe lack of state power to give witnesses protection
against federal prosecution does not defeat a state im-munity statute. The principle established is that full
and complete immunity against prosecution by the gov-ernment compelling the witness to answer is equivalent
to the protection furnished by the rule against compul-sory self-incrimination. Counselman v. Hitchcock, 142
U. S. 547. Brown v. Walker, 161 U. S. 591, 606. Jackv. Kansas, 199 U. S. 372, 381. Hale v. Henkel, 201 U. S.
43, 68. As appellee at the hearing did not invoke pro-tection against federal prosecution, his plea is without
merit and the government's demurrer should have beensustained."

Murdock, 284 U. S., at 149.

Murdock's resolution of the question received a subse-quent complement when we affirmed again that a State could

compel a witness to give testimony that might incriminatehim under federal law, see

Knapp v. Schweitzer, 357 U. S.371 (1958), overruled by Murphy v. Waterfront Comm'n of

N. Y. Harbor, 378 U. S. 52 (1964), testimony that we had pre-viously held to be admissible into evidence in the federal
courts, see Feldman v. United States, 322 U. S. 487 (1944),overruled by

Murphy, supra, at 80.

It has been suggested here that our precedent addressingfear of prosecution by a government other than the compelling authority fails to reflect the Murdock rule uniformly.

678 UNITED STATES v. BALSYS

Opinion of the Court
In 1927 (prior to our decision in Murdock), in a case involvinga request for habeas relief from a deportation order, we

declined to resolve whether "the Fifth Amendment guaran-tees immunity from self-incrimination under state statutes."
United States ex rel. Vajtauer v. Commissioner of Immigration, 273 U. S. 103, 113 (1927). Although we found that thewitness had waived his claim to the privilege, our decision

might be read to suggest that there was some tension be-tween the reasoning of two of the cases discussed above,
Hale v. Henkel and Brown v. Walker, and the analyses con-tained in two others, United States v. Saline Bank of Va., 1
Pet. 100 (1828), and Ballmann v. Fagin, 200 U. S. 186 (1906).273 U. S., at 113. These last two cases have in fact been
cited here for the claim that prior to due process incorpora-tion, the privilege could be asserted in a federal proceeding
based on fear of prosecution by a State.6 Saline Bank andBallmann are not, however, inconsistent with Murdock.

In Saline Bank, we permitted the defendants to refusediscovery sought by the United States in federal court,
where the defendants claimed that their responses would re-sult in incrimination under the laws of Virginia. "The rule
clearly is, that a party is not bound to make any discoverywhich would expose him to penalties, and this case falls
within it." 1 Pet., at 104. But, for all the sweep of thisstatement, the opinion makes no mention of the Fifth
Amendment, and in Hale v. Henkel, we explained that "theprosecution [in Saline Bank] was under a state law which
imposed the penalty, and . . . the Federal court was simply

6 The language in Vajtauer that has been cited in support of this suggestion says only that our conclusion that the witness waived his claim of
privilege "makes it unnecessary for us to consider the extent to which
the Fifth Amendment guarantees immunity from self-incrimination under
state statutes or whether this case is to be controlled by Hale v. Henkel,
201 U. S. 43; Brown v. Walker, 161 U. S. 591, 608; compare United States
v. Saline Bank, 1 Pet. 100; Ballmann v. Fagin, 200 U. S. 186, 195." 273
U. S., at 113.

Opinion of the Court
administering the state law." 201 U. S., at 69. The state
law, which addresses prosecutions brought by the State, suggested the rule that the Saline Bank Court applied to the
case before it; the law provided that "no disclosure made by
any party defendant to such suit in equity, and no books or
papers exhibited by him in answer to the bill, or under the
order of the Court, shall be used as evidence against him in
any . . . prosecution under this law," quoted in 1 Pet., at 104.
Saline Bank, then, may have turned on a reading of state
statutory law. Cf. McNaughton, Self-Incrimination Under
Foreign Law, 45 Va. L. Rev. 1299, 1305-1306 (1959) (suggesting that Saline Bank represents "an application not of the
privilege against self-incrimination . . . but of the principle
that equity will not aid a forfeiture"). But see Ballmann,
supra, at 195 (Holmes, J.) (suggesting that Saline Bank is a
Fifth Amendment case, though this view was soon repudiated by the Court in Hale, as just noted).

Where Saline Bank is laconic, Ballmann is equivocal.
While Ballmann specifically argued only the danger of incriminating himself under state law as his basis for invoking
the privilege in a federal proceeding, and we upheld his claim
of privilege, our opinion indicates that we concluded that
Ballmann might have had a fear of incrimination under federal law as well as under state law. While we did suggest,
contrary to the Murdock rule, that Ballmann might have
been able to invoke the privilege based on a fear of state
prosecution, the opinion says only that "[o]ne way or the
other [due to the risk of incrimination under federal or state
law] we are of opinion that Ballmann could not be required
to produce his cash book if he set up that it would tend to
criminate him." 200 U. S., at 195-196. At its equivocal
worst, Ballmann reigned for only two months. Hale v.
Henkel explained that "the only danger to be considered is
one arising within the same jurisdiction and under the same
sovereignty," 201 U. S., at 69, and Ballmann and Saline

Opinion of the Court
Bank were later, of course, superseded by Murdock withits unequivocal holding that prosecution in a state jurisdiction not bound by the Clause is beyond the purview of theprivilege.

C
In 1964, our precedent took a turn away from the unquali-fied proposition that fear of prosecution outside the jurisdiction seeking to compel testimony did not implicate a Fifth orFourteenth Amendment privilege, as the case might be. In
Murphy v. Waterfront Comm'n of N. Y. Harbor, 378 U. S.52 (1964), we reconsidered the converse of the situation in
Murdock, whether a witness in a state proceeding who hadbeen granted immunity from state prosecution could invoke
the privilege based on fear of prosecution on federal charges.In the course of enquiring into a work stoppage at several
New Jersey piers, the Waterfront Commission of New YorkHarbor subpoenaed the defendants, who were given immunity from prosecution under the laws of New Jersey and NewYork. When the witnesses persisted in refusing to testify
based on their fear of federal prosecution, they were held incivil contempt, and the order was affirmed by New Jersey's
highest court. In re Application of the Waterfront Comm'n
of N. Y. Harbor, 39 N. J. 436, 449, 189 A. 2d 36, 44 (1963).This Court held the defendants could be forced to testify

not because fear of federal prosecution was irrelevant butbecause the Self-Incrimination Clause barred the National
Government from using their state testimony or its fruits toobtain a federal conviction. We explained that "the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination protects a statewitness against incrimination under federal as well as state
law and a federal witness against incrimination under stateas well as federal law." 378 U. S., at 77-78.

Murphy is a case invested with two alternative rationales.Under the first, the result reached in Murphy was undoubtedly correct, given the decision rendered that very same dayin Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U. S. 1 (1964), which applied the

524US2 Unit: $U97 [09-06-00 19:37:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
doctrine of Fourteenth Amendment due process incorpora-tion to the Self-Incrimination Clause, so as to bind the States

as well as the National Government to recognize the privi-lege. Id., at 3. Prior to Malloy, the Court had refused to
impose the privilege against self-incrimination against theStates through the Fourteenth Amendment, see

Twining v.New Jersey, 211 U. S. 78 (1908), thus leaving state-court witnesses seeking exemption from compulsion to testify to theirrights under state law, as supplemented by the Fourteenth
Amendment's limitations on coerced confessions. Malloy,however, established that "[t]he Fourteenth Amendment secures against state invasion the same privilege that the FifthAmendment guarantees against federal infringement--the
right of a person to remain silent unless he chooses to speakin the unfettered exercise of his own will, and to suffer no
penalty . . . for such silence." 378 U. S., at 8.As the Court immediately thereafter said in

Murphy, Mal-loy "necessitate[d] a reconsideration" of the unqualified Murdock rule that a witness subject to testimonial compulsionin one jurisdiction, state or federal, could not plead fear of
prosecution in the other. 378 U. S., at 57. After Malloy,the Fifth Amendment limitation could no longer be seen as
framed for one jurisdiction alone, each jurisdiction havinginstead become subject to the same claim of privilege flowing
from the one limitation. Since fear of prosecution in the onejurisdiction bound by the Clause now implicated the very
privilege binding upon the other, the Murphy opinion sensi-bly recognized that if a witness could not assert the privilege
in such circumstances, the witness could be "whipsawed intoincriminating himself under both state and federal law even
though the constitutional privilege against self-incriminationis applicable to each." 378 U. S., at 55 (internal quotation
marks omitted).7 The whipsawing was possible owing to a

7 Prior to Murphy, such "whipsawing" efforts had been permissible, but
arguably less outrageous since, as the opinion notes, "either the `compelling' government or the `using' government [was] a State, and, until today,

682 UNITED STATES v. BALSYS

Opinion of the Court
feature unique to the guarantee against self-incriminationamong the several Fifth Amendment privileges. In the absence of waiver, the other such guarantees are purely andsimply binding on the government. But under the SelfIncrimination Clause, the government has an option to ex-change the stated privilege for an immunity to prosecutorial
use of any compelled inculpatory testimony. Kastigar v.
United States, 406 U. S., at 448-449. The only condition onthe government when it decides to offer immunity in place

of the privilege to stay silent is the requirement to providean immunity as broad as the privilege itself. Id., at 449.
After Malloy had held the privilege binding on the statejurisdictions as well as the National Government, it would
therefore have been intolerable to allow a prosecutor in oneor the other jurisdiction to eliminate the privilege by offering immunity less complete than the privilege's dual jurisdic-tional reach.

Murphy accordingly held that a federal courtcould not receive testimony compelled by a State in the absence of a statute effectively providing for federal immunity,and it did this by imposing an exclusionary rule prohibiting
the National Government "from making any such use of com-pelled testimony and its fruits," 378 U. S., at 79 (footnote
omitted).This view of

Murphy as necessitated by Malloy wasadopted in the subsequent case of Kastigar v. United States,

supra, at 456, n. 42 ("Reconsideration of the rule that theFifth Amendment privilege does not protect a witness in one
jurisdiction against being compelled to give testimony thatcould be used to convict him in another jurisdiction was
made necessary by the decision in Malloy v. Hogan"). Readthis way,

Murphy rests upon the same understanding of theSelf-Incrimination Clause that Murdock recognized and to

which the earlier cases had pointed. Although the Clauseserves a variety of interests in one degree or another, see

the States were not deemed fully bound by the privilege against selfincrimination." 378 U. S., at 57, n. 6.

683Cite as: 524 U. S. 666 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
Part IV, infra, at its heart lies the principle that the courtsof a government from which a witness may reasonably fear

prosecution may not in fairness compel the witness to furnishtestimonial evidence that may be used to prove his guilt.
After Murphy, the immunity option open to the ExecutiveBranch could be exercised only on the understanding that
the state and federal jurisdictions were as one, with a fed-erally mandated exclusionary rule filling the space between
the limits of state immunity statutes and the scope of theprivilege.

8 As so understood, Murphy stands at odds with

Balsys's claim.There is, however, a competing rationale in

Murphy, in-vesting the Clause with a more expansive promise. The

Murphy majority opened the door to this view by reject-ing this Court's previous understanding of the English
common-law evidentiary privilege against compelled self-incrimination, which could have informed the Framers' understanding of the Fifth Amendment privilege. See, e. g.,
Murphy, 378 U. S., at 67 (rejecting Murdock's analysis of thescope of the privilege under English common law). Having

removed what it saw as an unjustified, historically derived

8 Of course, the judicial exclusion of compelled testimony functions as
a fail-safe to ensure that compelled testimony is not admitted in a criminal proceeding. The general rule requires a grant of immunity prior to
the compelling of any testimony. We have said that the prediction that
a court in a future criminal prosecution would be obligated to protect
against the evidentiary use of compelled testimony is not enough to satisfy
the privilege against compelled self-incrimination. Pillsbury Co. v. Conboy, 459 U. S. 248, 261 (1983). The suggestion that a witness should rely
on a subsequent motion to suppress rather than a prior grant of immunity
"would [not] afford adequate protection. Without something more, [the
witness] would be compelled to surrender the very protection which the
privilege is designed to guarantee." Maness v. Meyers, 419 U. S. 449, 462
(1975) (footnote and internal quotation marks omitted). This general rule
ensures that we do not "let the cat out with no assurance whatever of
putting it back," id., at 463 (internal quotation marks omitted), and leaves
the decision whether to grant immunity to the Executive in accord with
congressional policy, see Pillsbury, supra, at 262.

684 UNITED STATES v. BALSYS

Opinion of the Court
limitation on the privilege, the Murphy Court expressed acomparatively ambitious conceptualization of personal privacy underlying the Clause, one capable of supporting, if notdemanding, the scope of protection that Balsys claims. As
the Court of Appeals recognized, if we take the Murphy
opinion at face value, the expansive rationale can be claimedquite as legitimately as the

Murdock-Malloy-Kastigar understanding of Murphy's result, and Balsys's claim accord-ingly requires us to decide whether

Murphy's innovative
side is as sound as its traditional one. We conclude that itis not.

As support for the view that the Court had previously misunderstood the English rule, Murphy relied, first, on two
preconstitutional English cases, East India Co. v. Campbell,
1 Ves. sen. 246, 27 Eng. Rep. 1010 (Ex. 1749), and Brownsword v. Edwards, 2 Ves. sen. 243, 28 Eng. Rep. 157
(Ch. 1750), for the proposition that a witness in an English
court was permitted to invoke the privilege based on fear of
prosecution in a foreign jurisdiction. See 378 U. S., at 58-
59. Neither of these cases is on point as holding that proposition, however. In East India Co., a defendant before the
Court of Exchequer, seeking to avoid giving an explanation
for his possession of certain goods, claimed the privilege on
the ground that his testimony might subject him to a fine or
corporal punishment. The Court of Exchequer found that
the defendant would be punishable in Calcutta, then an English Colony, and said it would "not oblige one to discover
that, which, if he answers in the affirmative, will subject him
to the punishment of a crime." 1 Ves. sen., at 247, 27 Eng.
Rep., at 1011. In Brownsword, a defendant before the
Court of Chancery claimed the privilege on the ground that
her testimony could render her liable to prosecution in an
English ecclesiastical court. "The general rule," the court
said, "is that no one is bound to answer so as to subject himself to punishment, whether that punishment arises by the
ecclesiastical law of the land." 2 Ves. sen., at 245, 28 Eng.

Opinion of the Court
Rep., at 158. Although this statement, like its counterpartin East India Co., is unqualified, neither case is authority

for the proposition that fear of prosecution in foreign courtsimplicates the privilege. For in each of these cases, the judicial system to which the witness's fears related was subjectto the same legislative sovereignty that had created the
courts in which the privilege was claimed.9 In fact, whenthese cases were decided, and for years after adoption of the
Fifth Amendment, English authority was silent on whetherfear of prosecution by a foreign nation implicated the privilege, and the Vice-Chancellor so stated in 1851. See King
of the Two Sicilies v. Willcox, 1 Sim. (N. S.) 301, 331, 61 Eng.Rep. 116, 128 (Ch. 1851) (observing, in the course of an opinion that clearly involved a claim of privilege based on thefear of prosecution by another sovereign, that there is an
"absence of all authority on the point").

Murphy, in fact, went on to discuss the case last cited, aswell as a subsequent one. The Murphy majority began by

acknowledging that King of the Two Sicilies was not author-ity for attacking this Court's prior view of English law. 378
U. S., at 60. In an opinion by Lord Cranworth, the Court ofChancery declined to allow defendants to assert the privilege

9 Further, the courts of both jurisdictions, at least in some cases, recognized the privilege against self-incrimination. East India Co. makes specific reference to the fact that the witness's testimony might be incriminating under the laws of Calcutta. 1 Ves. sen., at 247, 27 Eng. Rep., at 1011
("[T]hat he is punishable appears from the case of Omichund v. Barker
[1 Atk. 21, 26 Eng. Rep. 15 (1744)], as a jurisdiction is erected in Calcutta
for criminal facts"). As of 1726, Calcutta was a "presidency town," which
was subject to the civil jurisdiction of a "mayor's court." The mayor's
court followed the English Rules of Evidence, which would have included
the rule against self-incrimination. 1 Woodroffe & Ameer Ali's Law of
Evidence in India 13 (P. Ramaswami & S. Rajagopalan eds., 11th ed. 1962).
The ecclesiastical courts of England also recognized something akin to the
privilege at this time in some cases. See Helmholz, Origins of the Privilege Against Self-Incrimination: The Role of the European Ius Commune,
65 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 962, 969-974 (1990) (citing cases heard in ecclesiastical
courts in which the privilege was recognized).

686 UNITED STATES v. BALSYS

Opinion of the Court
based on their fear of prosecution in Sicily, for two reasons.1 Sim. (N. S.), at 329, 61 Eng. Rep., at 128. The first was

the court's belief that the privilege speaks only to mattersthat might be criminal under the laws of England: "The rule
relied on by the Defendants, is one which exists merely by
virtue of our own municipal law, and must, I think, have ref-erence, exclusively, to matters penal by that law: to matters

as to which, if disclosed, the Judge would be able to say,as matter of law, whether it could or could not entail penal
consequences." For the second, the court relied on the un-likelihood that the defendants would ever leave England and
be subject to Sicilian prosecution.

The Murphy majority nonetheless understood this rule to
have been undermined by the subsequent case of United
States of America v. McRae, 3 L. R. Ch. 79 (1867). See 378
U. S., at 61. In that suit brought by the United States
against McRae in England to recover funds that he had collected there as a Confederate agent during the Civil War,
the court recognized the privilege based on McRae's claim
that his testimony would incriminate him in the United
States. The court distinguished the litigation then before it
from King of the Two Sicilies, indicating that though it
agreed with the general principles stated by Lord Cranworth, see 3 L. R. Ch., at 84, he had not needed to lay down
the broad proposition that invocation of the privilege was
appropriate only with regard to matters penal under England's own law, see id., at 85. The court did not say that
the privilege could be invoked in any case involving fear of
prosecution under foreign law, however. Instead it noted
two distinctions from King of the Two Sicilies, the first being
that the "presumed ignorance of the Judge as to foreign law"
on which King of the Two Sicilies rested has been "completely removed by the admitted statements upon the pleadings," 3 L. R. Ch., at 85; the second being that McRae presented the unusual circumstance that the party seeking to
compel the testimony, the United States, was also the party

Opinion of the Court
that would prosecute any crime under its laws that might
thereby be revealed, id., at 87. The court's holding that the
privilege could be invoked in such circumstances does not,
however, support a general application of the privilege in
any case in which a witness fears prosecution under foreign
law by a party not before the court. Thus, Murphy went
too far in saying that McRae overruled King of the Two Sicilies.10 See Murphy, 378 U. S., at 71. What is of more fundamental importance, however, is that even if McRae had
announced a new development in English law going to the
heart of King of the Two Sicilies, it would have been irrelevant to Fifth Amendment interpretation. The presumed
influence of English law on the intentions of the Framers
hardly invests the Framers with clairvoyance, and subsequent English developments are not attributable to the
Framers by some rule of renvoi. Cf. Brown, 161 U. S., at
600 (citing Cathcart v. Robinson, 5 Pet. 264, 280 (1831)).
Since McRae neither stated nor implied any disagreement
with Lord Cranworth's 1857 statement in King of the Two
Sicilies that there was no clear prior authority on the
question, the Murphy Court had no authority showing that
Murdock rested on unsound historical assumptions contradicted by opinions of the English courts.

10 Murphy also cites Heriz v. Riera, 11 Sim. 318, 59 Eng. Rep. 896 (1840),
as support for the claim that the English rule allowed invocation of the
privilege based on fear of prosecution abroad. See 378 U. S., at 63. In
that case two Spanish women brought suit in England alleging that the
defendant had violated a contract that he entered into with their brother
and to which they were entitled to the proceeds as his heirs. The contract
provided that the plaintiffs' brother (and they as his heirs) were entitled
to a share of the proceeds from a mercantile contract with the Spanish
Government. The defendant responded that the contract was illegal
under the laws of Spain and hence unenforceable and resisted discovery
because his answers might incriminate him under the Spanish code. The
court accepted the defendant's plea, though it is unclear whether the court
ruled on the merits of the plaintiffs' claim or the self-incrimination issue.

688 UNITED STATES v. BALSYS

Opinion of the Court
In sum, to the extent that the Murphy majority wentbeyond its response to Malloy and undercut Murdock's rationale on historical grounds, its reasoning cannot be ac-cepted now. Long before today, indeed, Murphy's history
was shown to be fatally flawed.11

11 Murphy, 378 U. S., at 81, n. 1 (Harlan, J., concurring in judgment)
("The English rule is not clear"); United States v. (Under Seal), 794 F.

regard has been attacked, see Note, 69 Va. L. Rev. at 893-94 . . . . We do
not enter the dispute as to whether Murphy represents a correct statement of the English rule at a particular time because we do not think
that the Murphy holding depended upon the correctness of the Court's
understanding of the state of English law and reliance thereon as the sole
basis for decision. Rather, Murphy proceeds as a logical consequence to
the holding in Malloy v. Hogan . . ."); Note, Fifth Amendment Privilege

English law on [the question whether the privilege can be invoked based
on fear of prosecution] casts doubt on the Supreme Court's holding in Murphy, which was based on the assertion that McRae `represents the settled
"English rule" regarding self-incrimination under foreign law.' Indeed,
the Murphy Court's reliance on its idea of the `true' English rule has been
criticized by commentators, and its reading of British law was essentially
overruled by the British Parliament. Murphy's reliance on mistaken
interpretation and application of English law weakens its precedential
value" (footnotes omitted)); Note, The Reach of the Fifth Amendment

Second, the English courts had not decided a case involving incrimination
under the criminal laws of independent foreign sovereigns by the time our
Constitution was framed. The only English cases involving independent
sovereigns were decided more than sixty years later. Thus, even if the
fifth amendment embodied the English common law at the time it was
framed, the privilege did not incorporate any rule concerning foreign incrimination. Finally, even if the English rule protected against foreign
incrimination, the Supreme Court in Zicarelli indicated that it had not

Opinion of the Court

D
Although the Court and Justice Breyer's dissent differon details, including some considerations of policy addressed

in Part IV, infra, our basic disagreement with that dissentturns on three points. First, we start with what we think
is the most probable reading of the Clause in its FifthAmendment context, as limiting its principle to concern with
prosecution by a sovereign that is itself bound by the Clause;the dissent instead emphasizes the Clause's facial breadth as
consistent with a broader principle. Second, we rely on theforce of our precedent, notably Murdock, as confirming this
same-sovereign principle, as adapted to reflect the post-Malloy requirement of immunity effective against both sovereigns subject to the one privilege under the National Con-stitution; the dissent attributes less force to Murdock, giving
weight to its tension with the Saline Bank language, amongother things. Third, we reject

Murphy's restatement of thecommon-law background and read none of the common-law

cases as authority inconsistent with our contextual readingof the Clause, later confirmed by precedent such as Murdock;
the dissent finds support in the common-law cases for Mur-phy's historical reexamination and the broader reading of the
Clause. In the end, our contextual reading of the Clause,combined with the

Murdock holding, places a burden on anyformally adopted the rule in Murphy" (footnotes omitted)); Capra, The
Fifth Amendment and the Risk of Foreign Prosecution, N. Y. L. J., Mar.
8, 1991, p. 3 ("[D]espite Justice Goldberg's assertions in Murphy, it is clear
that there was never a `true' or uniform English rule. . . . [T]o the extent
that the English rule would be pertinent to the Fifth Amendment privilege, it would have had to exist at the time the Fifth Amendment was
adopted. Yet, as even Justice Goldberg admitted in Murphy, the English
cases involving independent sovereigns were decided more than 60 years
after the Fifth Amendment was adopted"); see also Law Reform Committee, Sixteenth Report, 1967, Cmnd. 3472, ||11, p. 7 (explaining that English

Opinion of the Court
one who contests the basic same-sovereign principle, a bur-den that only clear, contrary, preframing common law might

carry; since the dissent starts with a broader reading of theClause and a less potent view of Murdock, it does not require
Murphy and the common-law cases to satisfy such a burdenbefore definitively finding that a more expansive principle
underlies the Clause. IV

There remains, at least on the face of the Murphy majori-ty's opinion, a further invitation to revise the principle of
the Clause from what Murdock recognized. The Murphymajority opens its discussion with a catalog of "Policies of
the Privilege," 378 U. S., at 55 (citations and internal quota-tion marks omitted):

"It reflects many of our fundamental values and mostnoble aspirations: our unwillingness to subject those
suspected of crime to the cruel trilemma of self-accusation, perjury or contempt; our preference for an
accusatorial rather than an inquisitorial system of crimi-nal justice; our fear that self-incriminating statements
will be elicited by inhumane treatment and abuses; oursense of fair play which dictates a fair state-individual
balance by requiring the government to leave the indi-vidual alone until good cause is shown for disturbing him
and by requiring the government in its contest with theindividual to shoulder the entire load; our respect for the
inviolability of the human personality and of the right ofeach individual to a private enclave where he may lead
a private life, our distrust of self-deprecatory state-ments; and our realization that the privilege, while
sometimes a shelter to the guilty, is often a protectionto the innocent."

Some of the policies listed would seem to point no furtherthan domestic arrangements and so raise no basis for any
privilege looking beyond fear of domestic prosecution. Oth524US2 Unit: $U97 [09-06-00 19:37:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
ers, however, might suggest a concern broad enough to en-compass foreign prosecutions and accordingly to support a

more expansive theory of the privilege than the Murdockunderstanding would allow.

The adoption of any such revised theory would, however,necessarily rest on

Murphy's reading of preconstitutionalcommon-law cases as support for (or at least as opening the

door to) the expansive view of the Framers' intent, whichwe and the commentators since Murphy have found to be
unsupported. Once the Murphy majority's treatment of theEnglish cases is rejected as an indication of the meaning intended for the Clause, Murdock must be seen as precedentat odds with Balsys's claim. That precedent aside, however,
we think there would be sound reasons to stop short of rest-ing an expansion of the Clause's scope on the highly general
statements of policy expressed in the foregoing quotationfrom

Murphy. While its list does indeed catalog aspirationsfurthered by the Clause, its discussion does not even purport

to weigh the host of competing policy concerns that would beraised in a legitimate reconsideration of the Clause's scope.

A
The most general of Murphy's policy items ostensibly sug-gesting protection as comprehensive as that sought by

Balsys is listed in the opinion as "the inviolability of thehuman personality and . . . the right of each individual to a
private enclave where he may lead a private life." 378 U. S.,at 55 (internal quotation marks omitted). Whatever else
those terms might cover, protection of personal inviolabilityand the privacy of a testimonial enclave would necessarily
seem to include protection against the Government's veryintrusion through involuntary interrogation.

12 If in fact

12 We are assuming, arguendo, that the intrusion is a subject of the
Clause's protection. See Murphy, 378 U. S., at 57, n. 6; Gecas, 120 F. 3d,
at 1462 (Birch, J., dissenting); cf. United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez, 494
U. S. 259, 264 (1990) ("The privilege against self-incrimination guaranteed

692 UNITED STATES v. BALSYS

Opinion of the Court
these values were reliable guides to the actual scope of pro-tection under the Clause, they would be seen to demand a

very high degree of protection indeed: "inviolability" is, afterall, an uncompromising term, and we know as well from
Fourth Amendment law as from a layman's common sense
that breaches of privacy are complete at the moment of illicitintrusion, whatever use may or may not later be made of

their fruits. See United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez, 494U. S. 259, 264 (1990) (citing

United States v. Calandra, 414
U. S. 338, 354 (1974); United States v. Leon, 468 U. S. 897,906 (1984)).

The Fifth Amendment tradition, however, offers no suchdegree of protection. If the Government is ready to provide
the requisite use and derivative use immunity, see Kastigar,
406 U. S., at 453; see also Lefkowitz v. Turley, 414 U. S. 70,84 (1973), the protection goes no further: no violation of personality is recognized and no claim of privilege will avail.13
One might reply that the choice of the word "inviolability"
was just unfortunate; while testimonial integrity may not be
inviolable, it is sufficiently served by requiring the Government to pay a price in the form of use (and derivative use)
immunity before a refusal to testify will be overruled. But
that answer overlooks the fact that when a witness's response will raise no fear of criminal penalty, there is no protection for testimonial privacy at all. See United States v.
Ward, 448 U. S. 242, 248-255 (1980).

Thus, what we find in practice is not the protection of personal testimonial inviolability, but a conditional protection of
testimonial privacy subject to basic limits recognized before

by the Fifth Amendment is a fundamental trial right of criminal defendants. Although conduct by law enforcement officials prior to trial may
ultimately impair that right, a constitutional violation occurs only at trial"
(citation omitted)).

13 The practice of exchanging silence for immunity is unchallenged here

and presumably invulnerable, being apparently as old as the Fifth Amendment itself. See Kastigar, 406 U. S., at 445, and n. 13.

Opinion of the Court
the framing 14 and refined through immunity doctrine in theintervening years. Since the Judiciary could not recognize

fear of foreign prosecution and at the same time preservethe Government's existing rights to seek testimony in exchange for immunity (because domestic courts could notenforce the immunity abroad), it follows that extending protection as Balsys requests would change the balance of pri-vate and governmental interests that has seemingly been
accepted for as long as there has been Fifth Amendmentdoctrine. The upshot is that accepting personal testimonial integrity or privacy as a prima facie justification forthe development Balsys seeks would threaten a significant
change in the scope of traditional domestic protection; to theextent, on the other hand, that the domestic tradition is
thought worthy of preservation, an appeal to a general per-sonal testimonial integrity or privacy is not helpful. See
Doe v. United States, 487 U. S. 201, 213, n. 11 (1988) (findingno violation of the privilege "[d]espite the impact upon the
inviolability of the human personality"); Schmerber v. California, 384 U. S. 757, 762 (1966) (holding that a witness can-not rely on the privilege to decline to provide blood samples);

ibid. ("[T]he privilege has never been given the full scopewhich the values that it helps to protect suggest").

B
Murphy's policy catalog would provide support, at a rathermore concrete level, for Balsys's argument that application

of the privilege in situations like his would promote the pur-pose of preventing government overreaching, which on anyone's view lies at the core of the Clause's purposes. Thisargument begins with the premise that "cooperative internationalism" creates new incentives for the Government tofacilitate foreign criminal prosecutions. Because crime, like
legitimate trade, is increasingly international, a correspond14 See n. 13, supra.

524US2 Unit: $U97 [09-06-00 19:37:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN
694 UNITED STATES v. BALSYS

Opinion of the Court
ing degree of international cooperation is coming to charac-terize the enterprise of criminal prosecution.

15 The mission

of the OSI as shown in this case exemplifies the internationalcooperation that is said to undermine the legitimacy of treating separate governmental authorities as separate for pur-poses of liberty protection in domestic courts. Because the
Government now has a significant interest in seeing individu-als convicted abroad for their crimes, it is subject to the same
incentive to overreach that has required application of theprivilege in the domestic context. Balsys says that this argument is nothing more than the reasoning of the MurphyCourt when it justified its recognition of a fear of state prosecution by looking to the significance of " `cooperative federal-ism,' " the teamwork of state and national officials to fight
interstate crime. 378 U. S., at 55-56.But Balsys invests Murphy's "cooperative federalism"
with a significance unsupported by that opinion. We havealready pointed out that Murphy's expansion upon Murdock
is not supported by Murphy's unsound historical reexamina-tion, but must rest on

Murphy's other rationale, under whichits holding is a consequence of Malloy. That latter reading

is essential to an understanding of "cooperative federalism."For the Murphy majority, "cooperative federalism" was not
important standing alone, but simply because it underscoredthe significance of the Court's holding that after

Malloy it
would be unjustifiably formalistic for a federal court to ig-nore fear of state prosecution when ruling on a privilege

claim. Thus, the Court described the "whipsaw" effect that
the decision in Malloy would have created if fear of stateprosecution were not cognizable in a federal proceeding:

"[The] policies and purposes [of the privilege] are
defeated when a witness can be whipsawed into incriminating himself under both state and federal law

15 The Court of Appeals cited a considerable number of studies in the
growing literature on the subject. 119 F. 3d 122, 130-131 (CA2 1997).

Opinion of the Court
even though the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination is applicable to each. This has become

especially true in our age of `cooperative federalism,'where the Federal and State Governments are waging
a united front against many types of criminal activity."378 U. S., at 55-56 (citation and internal quotation
marks omitted).
Since in this case there is no analog of Malloy, imposingthe Fifth Amendment beyond the National Government,

there is no premise in Murphy for appealing to "cooperativeinternationalism" by analogy to "cooperative federalism."

16

Any analogy must, instead, be to the pre-Murphy era whenthe States were not bound by the privilege. Then, testimony compelled in a federal proceeding was admissible in astate prosecution, despite the fact that shared values and
similar criminal statutes of the state and national jurisdic-tions presumably furnished incentive for overreaching by the
Government to facilitate criminal prosecutions in the States.But even if Murphy were authority for considering "cooperative federalism" and "cooperative internationalism" asreasons supporting expansion of the scope of the privilege,

16 There is indeed nothing comparable to the Fifth Amendment privilege in any supranational prohibition against compelled self-incrimination
derived from any source, the privilege being "at best an emerging principle of international law." See Amann, A Whipsaw Cuts Both Ways,
45 UCLA L. Rev. 1201, 1259 (1998) (hereinafter Amann).

In the course of discussing the Eleventh Circuit case raising the same
issue as this one, Amann suggests nonetheless that the whipsaw rationale
has particular salience on these facts because along with the United
States, Lithuania and Israel are signatories to the International Covenant
on Civil and Political Rights, Dec. 16, 1966, G. A. Res. 2200, which recognizes something akin to the privilege. See Amann 1233, n. 206. The
significance of being bound by the Covenant, however, is limited by its
provision that the privilege is derogable and accordingly may be infringed
if public emergency necessitates. Id., at 1259, n. 354. In any event,
Balsys has made no claim under the Covenant, and its current enforceability in the courts of the signatories is an issue that is not before us.

524US2 Unit: $U97 [09-06-00 19:37:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN
696 UNITED STATES v. BALSYS

Opinion of the Court
any extension would depend ultimately on an analysis of thelikely costs and benefits of extending the privilege as Balsys

requests. If such analysis were dispositive for us, we wouldconclude that Balsys has not shown that extension of the
protection would produce a benefit justifying the rule heseeks.

The Court of Appeals directed careful attention to an eval-uation of what would be gained and lost on Balsys's view.
It concluded, for example, that few domestic cases would beadversely affected by recognizing the privilege based upon
fear of foreign prosecution, 119 F. 3d, at 135-137; 17 thatAmerican contempt sanctions for refusal to testify are so lenient in comparison to the likely consequences of foreignprosecution that a witness would probably refuse to testify
even if the privilege were unavailable to him, id., at 142(Block, J., concurring); that by statute and treaty the United
States could limit the occasions on which a reasonable fearof foreign prosecution could be shown, as by modifying extradition and deportation standards in cases involving theprivilege, id., at 138-139; and that because a witness's refusal
to testify may be used as evidence in a civil proceeding, de-portation of people in Balsys's position would not necessarily
be thwarted by recognizing the privilege as he claims it, id.,at 136.

The Court of Appeals accordingly thought the net burdenof the expanded privilege too negligible to justify denying
its expansion. We remain skeptical, however. While wewill not attempt to comment on every element of the Court
of Appeals's calculation, two of the points just noted wouldpresent difficulty. First, there is a question about the standard that should govern any decision to justify a truly discre-tionary ruling by making the assumption that it will induce
the Government to adopt legislation with international im-plications or to seek international agreements, in order to

17 The assessment was, of course, necessarily based on experience under
the same-sovereign view of the privilege.

697Cite as: 524 U. S. 666 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
mitigate the burdens that the ruling would otherwise im-pose. Because foreign relations are specifically committed

by the Constitution to the political branches, Art. II, $ 2, cl. 2,we would not make a discretionary judgment premised on
inducing them to adopt policies in relation to other nations
without squarely confronting the propriety of groundingjudicial action on such a premise.

Second, the very assumption that a witness's silence maybe used against him in a deportation or extradition proceeding due to its civil nature, 119 F. 3d, at 136 (citing LopezMendoza, 468 U. S., at 1038-1039), raises serious questions
about the likely gain from recognizing fear of foreign prosecution. For if a witness claiming the privilege ended up in
a foreign jurisdiction that, for whatever reason, recognized
no privilege under its criminal law, the recognition of the
privilege in the American courts would have gained nothing
for the witness. This possibility, of course, presents a sharp
contrast with the consequences of recognizing the privilege
based on fear of domestic prosecution. If testimony is compelled, Murphy itself illustrates that domestic courts are not
even wholly dependent on immunity statutes to see that no
use will be made against the witness; the exclusionary principle will guarantee that. See Murphy, 378 U. S., at 79.
Whatever the cost to the Government may be, the benefit to
the individual is not in doubt in a domestic proceeding.

Since the likely gain to the witness fearing foreign prosecution is thus uncertain, the countervailing uncertainty
about the loss of testimony to the United States cannot be
dismissed as comparatively unimportant. That some testimony will be lost is highly probable, since the United States
will not be able to guarantee immunity if testimony is
compelled (absent some sort of cooperative international
arrangement that we cannot assume will occur). While the
Court of Appeals is doubtless correct that the expected consequences of some foreign prosecutions may be so severe
that a witness will refuse to testify no matter what, not

698 UNITED STATES v. BALSYS

Opinion of the Court
every foreign prosecution may measure up so harshly asagainst the expectable domestic consequences of contempt

for refusing to testify. We therefore must suppose that onBalsys's view some evidence will in fact be lost to the domestic courts, and we are accordingly unable to dismiss the po-sition of the United States in this case, that domestic law
enforcement would suffer serious consequences if fear offoreign prosecution were recognized as sufficient to invoke
the privilege.In sum, the most we would feel able to conclude about the
net result of the benefits and burdens that would follow fromBalsys's view would be a Scotch verdict. If, then, precedent
for the traditional view of the scope of the Clause were notdispositive of the issue before us, if extending the scope of
the privilege were open to consideration, we still would notfind that Balsys had shown that recognizing his claim would
be a sound resolution of the competing interests involved.

V
This is not to say that cooperative conduct between theUnited States and foreign nations could not develop to a

point at which a claim could be made for recognizing fear offoreign prosecution under the Self-Incrimination Clause as
traditionally understood. If it could be said that the UnitedStates and its allies had enacted substantially similar criminal codes aimed at prosecuting offenses of international char-acter, and if it could be shown that the United States was
granting immunity from domestic prosecution for the pur-pose of obtaining evidence to be delivered to other nations
as prosecutors of a crime common to both countries, then anargument could be made that the Fifth Amendment should
apply based on fear of foreign prosecution simply becausethat prosecution was not fairly characterized as distinctly
"foreign." The point would be that the prosecution was asmuch on behalf of the United States as of the prosecuting
nation, so that the division of labor between evidence gath524US2 Unit: $U97 [09-06-00 19:37:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
erer and prosecutor made one nation the agent of the other,
rendering fear of foreign prosecution tantamount to fear of
a criminal case brought by the Government itself.

Whether such an argument should be sustained may be
left at the least for another day, since its premises do not fit
this case. It is true that Balsys has shown that the United
States has assumed an interest in foreign prosecution, as
demonstrated by OSI's mandate 18 and American treaty
agreements 19 requiring the Government to give to Lithuania
and Israel any evidence provided by Balsys. But this interest does not rise to the level of cooperative prosecution.
There is no system of complementary substantive offenses

18 According to Order No. 851-79, reprinted in App. 15-17, the OSI shall
"[m]aintain liaison with foreign prosecution, investigation and intelligence
offices; [u]se appropriate Government agency resources and personnel for
investigations, guidance, information, and analysis; and [d]irect and coordinate the investigation, prosecution, and any other legal actions instituted
in these cases with the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the United States Attorneys Offices, and
other relevant Federal agencies."

provides that the two governments "agree to cooperate in prosecution of
persons who are alleged to have committed war crimes . . . agree to provide mutual legal assistance concerning the prosecution of persons suspected of having committed war crimes . . . will assist each other in the
location of witnesses believed to possess relevant information about criminal actions . . . during World War II, and agree to intermediate and
endeavor to make these witnesses available for the purpose of giving

testimony in accordance with the laws of the Republic of Lithuania to

The District Court found that though it had not been made aware of a

at issue here, and the mere support of one nation for theprosecutorial efforts of another does not transform the

prosecution of the one into the prosecution of the other. Cf.Bartkus v. Illinois, 359 U. S. 121, 122-124 (1959) (rejecting
double jeopardy claim where federal officials turned over allevidence they had gathered in connection with federal prosecution of defendant for use in subsequent state prosecutionof defendant). In this case there is no basis for concluding
that the privilege will lose its meaning without a rule pre-cluding compelled testimony when there is a real and substantial risk that such testimony will be used in a criminalprosecution abroad.

* * *
Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is re-versed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings

consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Justice Stevens, concurring.
While I join the Court's opinion without reservation, Iwrite separately to emphasize these points.

The Clause that protects every person from being "com-pelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself "
is a part of the broader protection afforded by the FifthAmendment to the Constitution. That Amendment constrains the power of the Federal Government to deprive anyperson "of life, liberty, or property, without due process of
law," just as the Fourteenth Amendment imposes compara-ble constraints on the power of the States. The primary
office of the Clause at issue in this case is to afford protectionto persons whose liberty has been placed in jeopardy in an
American tribunal. The Court's holding today will not haveany adverse impact on the fairness of American criminal
trials.The fact that the issue in this case has been undecided for
such a long period of time suggests that our ruling will have

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
little, if any, impact on the fairness of trials conducted inother countries. Whether or not that suggestion is accurate, I do not believe our Bill of Rights was intended to haveany effect on the conduct of foreign proceedings. If, however, we were to accept respondent's interpretation of the
Clause, we would confer power on foreign governments toimpair the administration of justice in this country. A law

enacted by a foreign power making it a crime for one of itscitizens to testify in an American proceeding against another
citizen of that country would immunize those citizens frombeing compelled to testify in our courts. Variants of such a
hypothetical law are already in existence. See Socie'te' Nationale Industrielle Ae'rospatiale v. United States Dist.
Court for Southern Dist. of Iowa, 482 U. S. 522, 526, n. 6
(1987); see also id., at 544-545, n. 29. Of course, the Court
might craft exceptions for such foreign criminal laws, but it
seems far wiser to adhere to a clear limitation on the coverage of the Fifth Amendment, including its privilege against
self-incrimination. That Amendment prescribes rules of
conduct that must attend any deprivation of life, liberty, or
property in our Nation's courts.

Justice Ginsburg, dissenting.
The privilege against self-incrimination, "closely linked
historically with the abolition of torture," is properly regarded as a "landmar[k] in man's struggle to make himself
civilized." E. Griswold, The Fifth Amendment Today 7
(1955); see id., at 8 (Fifth Amendment expresses "one of the
fundamental decencies in the relation we have developed
between government and man"). In my view, the Fifth
Amendment privilege against self-incrimination prescribes a
rule of conduct generally to be followed by our Nation's officialdom. It counsels officers of the United States (and of
any State of the United States) against extracting testimony
when the person examined reasonably fears that his words
would be used against him in a later criminal prosecution.

Breyer, J., dissenting
As a restraint on compelling a person to bear witness againsthimself, the Amendment ordinarily should command the

respect of United States interrogators, whether the pros-ecution reasonably feared by the examinee is domestic or

foreign. Cf. DKT Memorial Fund Ltd. v. Agency for
International Development, 887 F. 2d 275, 307-308 (CADC1989) (R. B. Ginsburg, J., concurring in part and dissenting

expresses") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted);
United States v. Tiede, 86 F. R. D. 227 (U. S. Court for Berlin
1979) (foreign national accused of hijacking Polish aircraftabroad was tried under German substantive law in Berlin in

a court created by United States; U. S. court held foreign
national entitled to jury trial as a matter of constitutional
right). On this understanding of the "fundamental decenc[y]" the Fifth Amendment embodies, "its expression of
our view of civilized governmental conduct," Griswold,
supra, at 8, 9, I join Justice Breyer's dissenting opinion.

Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins,
dissenting.

Were Aloyzas Balsys to face even a theoretical possibility
that his testimony could lead a State to prosecute him for
murder, the Fifth Amendment would prohibit the Federal
Government from compelling that testimony. The Court
concludes, however, that the Fifth Amendment does not prohibit compulsion here because Balsys faces a real and substantial danger of prosecution not, say, by California, but by
a foreign nation. The Fifth Amendment, however, provides
that "[n]o person . . . shall be compelled in any criminal case
to be a witness against himself." U. S. Const., Amdt. 5 (emphasis added). This Court has not read the words "any
criminal case" to limit application of the Clause to only federal criminal cases. See Murphy v. Waterfront Comm'n of
N. Y. Harbor, 378 U. S. 52 (1964). That precedent, as well

Breyer, J., dissenting
as the basic principles underlying the privilege, convinceme that the Fifth Amendment's privilege against selfincrimination should encompass not only feared domesticprosecutions, but also feared foreign prosecutions where the
danger of an actual foreign prosecution is substantial.

I
I begin with a point that focuses upon precedent settingforth the current understanding of the scope of the word

"any," and that reveals the basic difference between the ma-jority's view of the privilege and the view this Court has
previously taken and should continue to take. The majorityfocuses upon one case, Murphy v. Waterfront Comm'n of
N. Y. Harbor, supra, which itself discusses much historicallyrelevant precedent. And the majority's focus upon that one
case is appropriate.

Murphy holds that "the constitutional privilege againstself-incrimination protects . . . a federal witness against incrimination under state . . . law." Id., at 77-78. As I readMurphy, the Court thought this conclusion flowed naturally
from its basic understanding of the scope of the FifthAmendment privilege. On that understanding, the privilege prohibits federal courts (and state courts through theFourteenth Amendment) from compelling a witness to furnish testimonial evidence that may be used to prove his guilt
if that witness may reasonably fear criminal prosecution.See id., at 60-63 (discussing the English cases, King of Two

Sicilies v. Willcox, 1 Sim. (N. S.) 301, 61 Eng. Rep. 116(Ch. 1851), and United States of America v. McRae, 3 L. R.
Ch. 79 (1867), as ones that, if rightly understood, embodythat proposition of law).

The privilege, understood in this way, requires the aboli-tion of any "same sovereign" rule. It is often reasonable for
a federal witness to fear state prosecution, and vice versa.Indeed, where testimony may incriminate and immunity has
not been granted, it is so reasonable that one can say, as a

704 UNITED STATES v. BALSYS

Breyer, J., dissenting
matter of law, that the privilege applies, across jurisdictions,to the entire class of cases involving federal witnesses who

fear state prosecutions and also to the entire class of casesinvolving state witnesses who fear federal prosecutions.
See Murphy, supra, at 77-78. Thus, the Fifth Amend-ment (or the Fourteenth Amendment) automatically prohibits compelled testimony in any such cross-jurisdictionalcircumstance.

If I am right about how Murphy should be understood,then that case directs the application of the privilege in this
one. That is because the only difference between Murphyand this case is that one cannot say, as a matter of law, that
every threat of a foreign prosecution is a reasonable threat.But where there is such a reasonable threat--where the
threat is "real and substantial," Zicarelli v. New JerseyComm'n of Investigation, 406 U. S. 472, 478 (1972)--the privilege, as Murphy understands it, would apply.

A
The majority says that one can read Murphy as embody-ing a very different rationale, a rationale that turns upon

considerations of federalism--the need to consider "state andfederal jurisdictions . . . as one" for purposes of applying the
privilege. Ante, at 683. It reads Murphy as a case thatsees at the heart of the Clause

"the principle that the courts of a government fromwhich a witness may reasonably fear prosecution may
not in fairness compel the witness to furnish testimonialevidence that may be used to prove his guilt." Ante, at
683 (emphasis added).
I have underscored the key words "from which." It is thesewords that tie the Clause to prosecutions by the same

sovereign.But what is the evidence that

Murphy put any legalweight at all upon those underscored words? What reason

524US2 Unit: $U97 [09-06-00 19:37:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN

705Cite as: 524 U. S. 666 (1998)
Breyer, J., dissenting
has the majority to believe that Murphy subscribes to, ordepends in any way upon, this phrasing of the privilege's

"principle" rather than upon the critically different "princi-ple" I suggested above,

i. e., the principle that "courts may
not in fairness compel a witness who reasonably fears prosecution to furnish testimony that may be used to prove hisguilt?"

The majority points to two relevant Murphy statements.In the first,

Murphy said that Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U. S. 1
(1964), which incorporated the Fifth Amendment privilegeas part of the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause,

"necessitates a reconsideration" of United States v. Murdock,284 U. S. 141 (1931), which had held that the Fifth Amendment protected an individual only from prosecutions by the
Federal Government. Murphy, 378 U. S., at 57. In thesecond,

Murphy mentioned, as one of many items of support
for its analysis, that most Fifth Amendment policies aredefeated

"when a witness `can be whipsawed into incriminatinghimself under both state and federal law even though'
the constitutional privilege against self-incriminationis applicable to each."

Id., at 55 (quoting Knapp
v. Schweitzer, 357 U. S. 371, 385 (1958) (Black, J.,dissenting)).

Since the first statement mentions only a reason for reconsid-ering

Murdock, since the second offers support on either
analysis, and since neither refers to any "alternative ration-al[e]" for decision,

ante, at 680, the majority's evidence for
its reinterpretation of Murphy seems rather skimpy.

Now consider the reasons for believing that Murphy rests
upon a different rationale--a rationale that, by focusing upon
the basic nature and history of the underlying right, rejects
Murdock's "same sovereign" rule. First, Murphy holds that
the "constitutional privilege" itself, not that privilege together with principles of federalism, "protects . . . a federal

524US2 Unit: $U97 [09-06-00 19:37:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN
706 UNITED STATES v. BALSYS

Breyer, J., dissenting
witness against incrimination under state . . . law." Murphy, supra, at 78. Second, it says explicitly that it "reject[s]" the Murdock rule, not because of considerations of
federalism arising out of Malloy, but because it is "unsupported by history or policy" and represents a "deviation"
from a "correct . . . construction" of the privilege in light of
its "history, policies and purposes." Murphy, supra, at 77.
Third, about half of the opinion consists of an effort to demonstrate that the privilege, as understood by the English
courts and by American courts prior to Murdock, protected
individuals from compelled testimony in the face of a realistic
threat of prosecution by any sovereign, not simply by the
same sovereign that compelled the testimony. See Murphy,
378 U. S., at 58-70. Fourth, the rest of the Court's analysis
consists of a discussion of the purposes of the privilege,
which, in the Court's view, lead to a similar conclusion. See
id., at 55-56. Fifth, the Court explicitly rejects the analysis
of commentators who argued for a "same sovereign" rule on
the ground that their understanding of the privilege's purposes was incomplete. See id., at 56-57, n. 5 (rejecting 8
J. Wigmore, Evidence $ 2258, p. 345 (McNaughton rev. 1961)).
Sixth, the Court nowhere describes its rationale in "silver
platter" or similar terms that could lead one to conclude that
its rule is prophylactic, enforcement based, or rests upon any
rationale other than that the privilege is not limited to protection against prosecution by the same jurisdiction that
compels the testimony. Cf. 378 U. S., at 80-81 (Harlan, J.,
concurring in judgment).

Consequently, I believe one must read Murphy as standing
for the proposition that the privilege includes protection
against being compelled to testify by the Federal Government where that testimony might be used in a criminal
prosecution conducted by another sovereign. And the question the Court must consequently face is whether we should
reject the rationale of that case when we answer the ques524US2 Unit: $U97 [09-06-00 19:37:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Breyer, J., dissenting
tion presented here. In other words, we must ask not,"what did Murphy hold," but "was Murphy right?"

B
Since Murphy is prevailing law, the majority bears theburden of showing that Murphy is wrong; and the majority

says that Murphy's reasoning is "fatally flawed" and legally"unsound."

Ante, at 687-688. But it is not. Murphy'sreasoning finds in Malloy's holding (that the privilege binds

the States) a need to reexamine the "same sovereign" rule,first set forth in the earlier case of Murdock. Without reexamination, Murdock's rule would have permitted Stateand Federal Governments each to have compelled testimony
for use by the other. Murphy's reasoning then finds the"same sovereign" rule unsound as a matter of history and of
the basic purposes of the privilege.

Murphy's use of legal history is traditional. It notes thatMurdock rested its own conclusion upon earlier English and

American cases. It reads the language of those cases inlight of the reasons that underlie it. It says that, so read,
those cases did not stand for a "same sovereign" rule, butsuggested the contrary. And it concludes that

Murdock'slegal pedigree is suspicious or illegitimate. In a word, Murphy examines Murdock's historical pedigree very much theway that the majority today analyzes that of Murphy. The
difference, however, is that Murphy makes a better case foroverturning its predecessor than does the majority.

I can reiterate the essence of Murphy's analysis, amendingit to fit the present case, roughly as follows:

1. Murdock thought that English law embodied a"same sovereign" rule, but it did not. Two early English cases, one decided in 1749 and the other in 1750,held that the privilege applied even though the feared
prosecution was, in the one case, in Calcutta, and in theother, by ecclesiastical authorities.

East India Co. v.

708 UNITED STATES v. BALSYS

Breyer, J., dissenting
Campbell, 1 Ves. sen. 246, 27 Eng. Rep. 1010 (Ex. 1749);
Brownsword v. Edwards, 2 Ves. sen. 243, 28 Eng. Rep.
157 (Ch. 1750). Those cases said nothing about whetheror not the law of Calcutta, church law, and English law

all emanate from a single sovereign. But Murdock had
cited a famous later English case, King of Two Siciliesv.

Willcox, 1 Sim. (N. S.) 301, 61 Eng. Rep. 116 (Ch.
1851), as standing for the "same sovereign" principle.It is true that one of the English judges in that case,

Lord Cranworth, said that the privilege involves only"matters [made] penal by [English] . . . law."

Id., at 329,
61 Eng. Rep., at 128. But Lord Cranworth immediately
qualified that conclusion by restating the conclusion in
terms of its rationale, namely, that the privilege applies
"to matters as to which, if disclosed, the Judge would be
able to say, as matter of law, whether it could or could
not entail penal consequences." Ibid. And, 16 years
later, the English courts sustained a claim of privilege
involving a threatened forfeiture in America. United
States of America v. McRae, 3 L. R. Ch. 79 (1867). In
doing so, the McRae court said both that Lord Cranworth's statement in King of the Two Sicilies "la[id]
down . . . a proposition" that was "broad[er]" than necessary to "support the judgment," and that the true reason the privilege had not applied in the earlier case was
because the judge did not "know . . . with certainty . . .
the [foreign law, hence] whether the acts . . . had rendered [the defendants] amenable to punishment" and
"it was doubtful whether the Defendants would ever
be within the reach of a prosecution, and their being so
depended on their voluntary return to [Sicily]." United
States of America v. McRae, supra, at 85, 87.

Thus, the true English rule as of the time of Murdock,
insofar as any of these cases reveal that rule, was not a
"same sovereign" rule, but a rule that the privilege did
not apply to prosecutions by another sovereign where

Breyer, J., dissenting
the danger of any such prosecution was speculative or
insubstantial. Cf. Queen v. Boyes, 1 B. & S. 311, 330,
121 Eng. Rep. 730, 738 (Q. B. 1861) ("[T]he danger tobe apprehended must be real and appreciable . . . not a

danger of an imaginary and unsubstantial character").
Where is Murphy's error?

2. Murdock thought that earlier American cases required a "same sovereign" rule, but they did not. To
the contrary: Chief Justice Marshall, in United States v.

Saline Bank of Va., 1 Pet. 100 (1828), wrote that "a
party is not bound to make any discovery which wouldexpose him to penalties."

Id., at 104. Justice Holmes
later cited this case as authority for the proposition thatthe Fifth Amendment privilege "exonerated" a federal

witness "from [making] disclosures which would have
exposed him to the penalties of the state law." Ballmann v. Fagin, 200 U. S. 186, 195 (1906). Lower federal
courts, consistent with the English rule, had held that awitness could refuse to answer questions based on the

danger of incrimination in another jurisdiction. See,
e. g., In re Hess, 134 F. 109, 112 (ED Pa. 1905); In re
Graham, 10 F. Cas. 913, 914 (No. 5,659) (SDNY 1876).True, the Court had written in dicta that "[w]e think the

legal immunity is in regard to a prosecution in the same
jurisdiction, and when that is fully given it is enough."
Jack v. Kansas, 199 U. S. 372, 382 (1905). But that unexplained dicta, which a later case linked to a (misunder-stood) English rule, see

Hale v. Henkel, 201 U. S. 43,
68-69 (1906), provides an insufficient historical basis for
Murdock's summary conclusion, particularly since the
Court, immediately prior to Murdock, had indicated that
the question remained open. See United States ex rel.
Vajtauer v. Commissioner of Immigration, 273 U. S. 103
(1927) (reserving question; citing Saline Bank and Ballmann v. Fagin).

710 UNITED STATES v. BALSYS

Breyer, J., dissenting
Again, where is Murphy's error?Stated in this minimal way,

Murphy's historical analysis is
difficult to attack. One can, of course, always point to spe-cial features of a case and thereby distinguish it. In respect

to the mid-18th-century English cases, one can point out that
Calcutta and the church may not have been completely sepa-rate "sovereigns."

Ante, at 685. And Saline Bank might
have involved application by the federal court of a state lawthat, without the help of the Fifth Amendment, protected a

party from self-incrimination. But see Saline Bank, supra,at 103 (citing Virginia privilege statute which, by its terms,
applied to suit by the state "Attorney General" in the state
"Superior Court of Chancery for the district of Richmond"
for recovery of a bank's capital stock "in behalf of the Commonwealth"). But this kind of criticism is beside the point.
The English judges made no point of the former. See ante,
at 685 (statements about the privilege in these cases were
"unqualified"). It does not denigrate their learning to suggest that they did not articulate the precise sovereigntyrelated status of ecclesiastical courts or of Calcutta's criminal
law in 1749. Nor did Justice Holmes make any point of the
latter. See Ballmann v. Fagin, supra, at 195. As for the
suggestion that it is illegitimate to consider the later English
authorities in construing the privilege, see ante, at 687, one
would think that, on this view, Murdock is at least as vulnerable as Murphy.

Most importantly, neither the majority today, nor the authorities it cites, see ante, at 688-689, n. 11, shows that the
key historical points upon which Murphy relied are clearly
wrong. At worst, Murphy represents one possible reading
of a history that is itself unclear. Murphy's main criticisms
of Murdock are reasonable ones. Its reading of earlier
cases, insofar as they were relevant to its criticism of Murdock, was plausible then, see Grant, Federalism and SelfIncrimination, 4 UCLA L. Rev. 549, 562 (1957) (Murdock
"illustrates the danger of copying one's precedents directly

from the brief of counsel"); and it is plausible now. Thatminimalist conclusion is sufficient for present purposes.

Even if Murdock's 3-sentence, and Murphy's 20-page, histor-ical analyses were equally plausible, we would need something more to abandon Murphy, for it is the most recent, and
thereby governing, precedent.Nor can I find any other reason for rejecting

Murphy and,
thereby, resurrecting Murdock. The Fifth Amendment'slanguage permits

Murphy's construction, for it says "any
criminal case." The history of the Amendment's enactmentsimply does not answer the question about whether or not it

applied where there is a substantial danger of prosecution in
another jurisdiction. See United States v. Gecas, 120 F. 3d
1419, 1435 (CA11 1997) (en banc) (Fifth Amendment privilege "has virtually no legislative history"); Moglen, Taking
the Fifth: Reconsidering the Origins of the Constitutional
Privilege Against Self-Incrimination, 92 Mich. L. Rev. 1086,
1123 (1994) (Fifth Amendment's legislative history "adds little to our understanding of the history of the privilege"). It
is possible that the language, "in any criminal case," was
aimed at limiting protection to compelled testimony against
penal interests, a reading consistent with the Court's contemporary understanding of the Clause. See, e. g., United
States v. Ward, 448 U. S. 242, 248-255 (1980) (rejecting claim
to privilege based on fear of civil penalty, in part, because
Clause "is expressly limited to `any criminal case' "); 5 The
Founders' Constitution 262 (P. Kurland & R. Lerner eds.
1987) (indicating that phrase "in any criminal case" was proposed by Representative Lawrence to ensure that the Clause
was not "in some degree contrary to laws passed"). And it
is also possible that the language was intended to limit the
proceedings in which the privilege could be claimed to criminal cases, which understanding the Court rejected long ago.
See McCarthy v. Arndstein, 266 U. S. 34, 40 (1924) (The privilege "applies alike to civil and criminal proceedings, wherever the answer might tend to subject to criminal responsi524US2 Unit: $U97 [09-06-00 19:37:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Breyer, J., dissenting
bility him who gives it"). Neither of these readings is anymore speculative, as a textual or historical matter, than reading the Clause as the majority does, against its text, to re-strict the universe of feared prosecutions upon which basis
the privilege may be asserted.What is more, there is no suggestion that

Murphy'srule, applied to state and federal prosecutions, "has proven

to be intolerable simply in defying practical workability."Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S.
833, 854 (1992) (citing Swift & Co. v. Wickham, 382 U. S. 111,116 (1965)). Nor have the facts, or related principles of law,
subsequently changed so much "as to have robbed the oldrule of significant application or justification." 505 U. S., at
855 (citing Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164,173-174 (1989), and

Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285U. S. 393, 412 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting)). Indeed, it

was the Murdock rule's legitimacy that, prior to Murphy,consistently divided the Court. See, e. g., Irvine v. California, 347 U. S. 128, 139-142 (1954) (Black, J., joined by Doug-las, J., dissenting) ("I cannot agree that the [Fifth] Amendment's guarantee against self-incrimination testimony can bespirited away by the ingenious contrivance of using federally
extorted confessions to convict of state crimes and viceversa");

Feldman v. United States, 322 U. S. 487, 494-503(1944) (Black, J., joined by Douglas and Rutledge, JJ.,

dissenting).The conclusion that I draw is that the rationale established
through Murphy's precedent governs. That rationale inter-prets the privilege as applicable at the least where a person
faces a substantial threat of prosecution in another jurisdic-tion. And that reading of the privilege favors Balsys here.

II
Precedent aside, I still disagree with the Court's conclu-sion. As

Murphy said, and as the Second Circuit reiterated,the Fifth Amendment reflects not one, but several different

purposes. 378 U. S., at 55; 119 F. 3d 122, 129 (1997). Andwhatever the disagreement about the relative weight to be

given each of those purposes or their historical origins, Ibelieve that these purposes argue in favor of the Second Circuit's interpretation. Namely, an interpretation that findsthe Fifth Amendment privilege applicable where the threat
of a foreign prosecution is "real and substantial," as it ishere. See

United States of America v. McRae, 3 L. R. Ch.,at 85-87 (distinguishing King of the Two Sicilies v. Willcox,

1 Sim. (N. S.) 301, 61 Eng. Rep. 116 (Ch. 1851), on thisground); cf. Queen v. Boyes, 1 B. & S., at 330, 121 Eng. Rep.,
at 738. A

This Court has often found, for example, that the privilegerecognizes the unseemliness, the insult to human dignity,
created when a person must convict himself out of his ownmouth. "At its core, the privilege reflects our fierce `unwillingness to subject those suspected of crime to the cruel[choice] of self-accusation, perjury or contempt.' "

Pennsyl-vania v. Muniz, 496 U. S. 582, 596 (1990) (quoting Doe v.

United States, 487 U. S. 201, 212 (1988)); South Dakota v.Neville, 459 U. S. 553, 563 (1983). The privilege can reflect
this value, and help protect against this indignity, even ifother considerations produce only partial protection--protection that can be overcome by other needs. Cf. Mac-Nair, Early Development of the Privilege Against SelfIncrimination, 10 Oxford J. Legal Studies 66, 70 (1990) (earlyecclesiastical procedure recognized privilege until an accusation was made that person had committed an offense); ante,at 692 (observing that the "protection of personal testimonial
inviolability" is not a "reliable guid[e]" to the "actual scopeof protection under the Clause"). And that value is no less
at stake where a foreign, but not a domestic, prosecution isat issue.

This Court has also said that the privilege serves to pro-tect personal privacy, by discouraging prosecution for crimes

of thought. See Muniz, supra, at 595-596 (describing Eng-lish Star Chamber "wherein suspects were forced to choose

between revealing incriminating private thoughts and for-saking their oath by committing perjury");

United States v.
Nobles, 422 U. S. 225, 233 (1975) ("The Fifth Amendment
privilege . . . protects `a private inner sanctum of individualfeeling and thought and proscribes state intrusion to extract

self-condemnation' " (quoting Couch v. United States, 409U. S. 322, 327 (1973))). Indeed, some have argued that the
Puritans championed the privilege because, had the 17th-century state questioned them about their beliefs, they
would have had to answer truthfully and thus suffer condemnation. See L. Levy, Origins of the Fifth Amendment 134
(1968) ("If [a Puritan] took the oath and lied, he committed
the unpardonable and cardinal sin of perjury which was simply not an option for a religious man"). This consideration
may prove less important today domestically, for the First
Amendment protects against the prosecution of thought
crime. But that fact also provides no reason for denying
protection where the prosecution is foreign.

The Court has said that the privilege reflects, too, "our
fear that self-incriminating statements will be elicited by inhumane treatment and abuses." Murphy, 378 U. S., at 55.
This concern with governmental "overreaching" would appear implicated as much when the foreseen prosecution is by
another country as when it is by another domestic jurisdiction. Indeed, the analogy to Murphy's observation about
"cooperative federalism," in which State and Federal Governments wage "a united front against many types of criminal activity," id., at 56, is a powerful one. That is because,
in the 30 years since Murphy, the United States has dramatically increased its level of cooperation with foreign governments to combat crime. See generally E. Nadelman, Cops

Law Enforcement (1993); Bassiouni, Policy Considerations

with foreign governments in order to facilitate criminalprosecutions abroad, see New MLAT Treaties Increase

DOJ's Reach, 4 No. 7 DOJ Alert 7 (Apr. 18, 1994) (listing anddiscussing treaties); it has signed more than 50 new extradition agreements, see 18 U. S. C. $ 3181 (1994 ed., Supp. II)(listing extradition treaties ratified since 1960); Nadelman,

an order of magnitude the number of law enforcement offices

of centralizing and giving greater emphasis and visibility to
[the Justice Department's] prosecutorial service functions in

growth in the numbers of requests for evidence in criminal
cases" since the 1970's, id., at 402 (discussing DOJ's Office of

Indeed, the United States has a significant stake in the
foreign prosecution at issue here. Congress has passed a
deportation law targeted at suspected Nazi war criminals.
See 8 U. S. C. $ 1182(a)(3)(E). The Justice Department has
established an agency whose mandate includes the assistance
of foreign governments in the prosecution of those deported.
See App. 15-17 (Order No. 851-79, establishing DOJ's Office
of Special Investigations). And the United States has
agreed with Lithuania (where Balsys may stand trial) "to
cooperate in prosecution of persons who are alleged to have
committed war crimes . . . [and] to provide . . . legal assistance concerning [such] prosecution[s]." Memorandum of

tice and Office of Procurator General of the Republic of Lithuania Concerning Cooperation in the Pursuit of War Criminals, Aug. 3, 1992, App. in No. 96-6144 (CA2), p. 395. As
the Second Circuit reasoned, since the Federal Government
now has a stake in many foreign prosecutions akin to its
stake in state prosecutions, a stake illustrated by this case,
the privilege's purpose of preventing governmental overreaching is served by recognizing the privilege in the former
class of cases, just as it is served in the cases of "cooperative
federalism" identified by Murphy. Indeed, experience suggests that the possibility of governmental abuses in cases
like this one--where the United States has an admittedly
keen interest in the later, foreign prosecution--is not totally
speculative. See, e. g., Demjanjuk v. Petrovsky, 10 F. 3d 338
(CA6 1993).

An additional purpose served by the privilege is "our preference for an accusatorial rather than an inquisitorial system
of criminal justice." Murphy, supra, at 55. Even if this
systemic value speaks to "domestic arrangements" only,
ante, at 690, the investigation of crime is as much a part
of our "system" of criminal justice as is any later criminal
prosecution. Reflecting this fact, the Court has said that
the Fifth Amendment affords individuals protection during
the investigation, as well as the trial, of a crime. See Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966). And the importance
we place in our system of criminal investigation, and the distaste we have for its alternatives, would stand diminished if
an accused were denied the Fifth Amendment's protections
because the criminal case against him, though built in this
country by our Government, was ultimately to be prosecuted
in another. This is true regardless of whether the "Bill of
Rights was intended to have any effect on the conduct of
foreign proceedings." Ante, at 701 (Stevens, J., concurring). The Fifth Amendment undeniably "prescribes a rule
of conduct generally to be followed by our Nation's official524US2 Unit: $U97 [09-06-00 19:37:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Breyer, J., dissenting
dom," ibid. (Ginsburg, J., dissenting), and it is that conduct,not a foreign proceeding, that is at issue here.

B
If the policies and purposes that this Court has said under-lie the Fifth Amendment--respect for individual dignity and

privacy, prevention of governmental overreaching, preserva-tion of an accusatorial system of criminal justice--would all
be well served by applying the privilege when a witness le-gitimately fears foreign prosecution, then what reason could
there be for reinterpreting the privilege so as not to recog-nize it here?

Two reasons have been suggested: First, one might see agovernment's compulsion of testimony followed by its own
use of that testimony in a criminal prosecution as somewhatmore unfair than compulsion by one government and use by
another. And one might also find the States and the FederalGovernment so closely interconnected that the unfairness is
further diminished where the prosecuting sovereign is a for-eign country.

But this factor, in my view, cannot be determinative. Forone thing, this issue of fairness is a matter of degree, not
kind. For another, changes in transportation and communi-cation have made relationships among nations ever closer, to
the point where cooperation among international prosecutorsand police forces may be as great today as among the States
(or between the States and the Federal Government) a halfcentury ago. See

supra, at 714-715 (discussing rise in inter-national cooperation). Finally, this Court's cases suggest

that the remaining considerations--particularly the inherentindignity and cruelty to the individual in compelling selfincrimination--bulk larger in terms of the basic values that
the Fifth Amendment reflects than does this single, partial,fairness consideration. See

supra, at 712-713 (citing cases).
I cannot agree that this particular feature--the fact that

524US2 Unit: $U97 [09-06-00 19:37:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN
718 UNITED STATES v. BALSYS

Breyer, J., dissenting
prosecution by a different sovereign seems not quite as un-fair as prosecution by the same sovereign--could warrant

denying the privilege's application.The second consideration is practical. The majority, as
well as the Government, fear that application of the privilege
might unreasonably interfere with the work of law enforce-ment. See

ante, at 697-698; Brief for United States 30-36.
But in my view, that fear is overstated. After all, "foreignapplication" of the privilege would matter only in a case

where an individual could not be prosecuted domestically butthe threat of foreign prosecution is substantial. Cf.

Zicarelli, 406 U. S., at 478-481 (declining to reach privilege claim
because witness did not face "real danger" of foreign prosecution). The Second Circuit points out that there have only
been a handful of such cases. 119 F. 3d, at 135 (finding only
six cases in the 25 years since Zicarelli). That is because
relatively few witnesses face deportation or extradition, and
a witness who will not " `be forced to enter a country disposed to prosecute him,' " 119 F. 3d, at 135 (quoting United
States v. Gecas, 50 F. 3d 1549, 1560 (CA11 1995), cannot make
the showing of "real and substantial" fear that Zicarelli
would require.

Moreover, even where a substantial likelihood of foreign
prosecution can be shown, the Government would only be
deprived of testimony that relates to the foreign crime; the
witness would not be entitled to claim a general silence.
See Hoffman v. United States, 341 U. S. 479, 486 (1951) (witness may only refuse to answer questions that might "in
themselves support a conviction" or "furnish a link in the
chain of evidence" for such crime). And nothing would prevent the Government, in a civil proceeding, from arguing
that an adverse inference should be drawn from the witnesses' silence on particular questions, see Baxter v. Palmigiano, 425 U. S. 308, 318 (1976), or from supporting that inference with evidence from other, nonprivileged sources.
Thus, without any adjustment in practice, it would seem that

524US2 Unit: $U97 [09-06-00 19:37:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN

719Cite as: 524 U. S. 666 (1998)
Breyer, J., dissenting
the Government would lose little information, and evenfewer cases, were the privilege recognized here.

In those rare instances where the need for testimony wassufficiently great, a grant of

de facto "immunity" remains a
possibility. The Government need only take steps sufficient
to make the threat of foreign prosecution insubstantial.Thus, a promise by the United States that deportation will

not take place, or that deportation to a different country willensue, would seem sufficient. A further promise by the foreign nation that prosecution will not take place, or will notmake use of the elicited testimony, will obviate the need even
for such a deportation promise. And were a foreign sovereign to later seek extradition of the witness, the Government, under existing law, might retain the discretion to decline such a request. See 18 U. S. C. $ 3186 ("Secretary of
State may order" extraditable person "delivered to . . . foreign government"); $ 3196 (giving Secretary of State discretion whether to extradite United States citizens provided
treaty does not obligate her to do so).

I do not want to minimize the potential difficulties inherent in providing this kind of "immunity." It might require
a change in domestic law, or in a given case, an adjustment
in an understanding reached with a foreign government. In
unusual circumstances, as Justice Stevens recognizes, see
ante, at 701, it might require adjusting the legal rules that
express the privilege in order to prevent a foreign government's efforts to stop its citizens from testifying in American
courts. But I do not see these difficulties as creating overwhelming obstacles to the legitimate application of the privilege in instances such as the one present here. Nor do I
see these difficulties as significantly greater than those that
inhere in the ordinary grant of immunity, which also requires
legislation, and which also can create friction among competing jurisdictions. At worst, granting de facto "immunity" in
this type of case would mean more potentially deportable
criminal aliens will remain in the United States, just as to524US2 Unit: $U97 [09-06-00 19:37:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN
720 UNITED STATES v. BALSYS

Breyer, J., dissenting
day's immunity means more potentially imprisonable citizensremain at liberty. This is a price that the Amendment extracts where government wishes to compel incriminatingtestimony; and it is difficult to see why that price should not
be paid where there is a real threat of prosecution, but itis foreign.

* * *
In sum, I see no reason why the Court should resurrectthe pale shadow of Murdock's "same sovereign" rule, a rule

that Murphy demonstrated was without strong historicalfoundation and that would serve no more valid a purpose in
today's world than it did during Murphy's time. Murphysupports recognizing the privilege where there is a real and
substantial threat of prosecution by a foreign government.Balsys is among the few to have satisfied this threshold.
The basic values that this Court has said underlie the FifthAmendment's protections are each diminished if the privilege may not be claimed here. And surmountable practi-cal concerns should not stand in the way of constitutional
principle.For these and related reasons elaborated by the Second
Circuit, I respectfully dissent.

721OCTOBER TERM, 1997
Syllabus

MONGE v. CALIFORNIA
certiorari to the supreme court of california

No. 97-6146. Argued April 28, 1998--Decided June 26, 1998
California's "three-strikes" law provides, among other things, that a

convicted felon with one prior conviction for a serious felony--such as
assault where the felon inflicted great bodily injury or personally used
a dangerous or deadly weapon--will have his prison term doubled.
Under California law, a number of procedural safeguards surround the
assessment of prior conviction allegations: Defendants may invoke the
right to a jury trial, the right to confront witnesses, and the privilege
against self-incrimination; the prosecution must prove the allegations
beyond a reasonable doubt; and the rules of evidence apply. After petitioner was convicted on three counts of violating California drug laws,
the State sought to have his sentence enhanced based on a previous
assault conviction and the resulting prison term. At the sentencing
hearing, the prosecutor asserted that petitioner had personally used a
stick during the assault, but introduced into evidence only a prison record showing that he had been convicted of assault with a deadly weapon
and had served a prison term for the offense. Finding both sentencing
allegations true, the trial court, as relevant here, doubled petitioner's
sentence on count one and added a 1-year enhancement for the prior
prison term. On appeal, the California Court of Appeal ruled that the
evidence was insufficient to trigger the sentence enhancement because
the prior conviction allegations were not proved beyond a reasonable
doubt, and that a remand for retrial on the sentence enhancement would
violate double jeopardy principles. The State Supreme Court reversed
the double jeopardy ruling, with a plurality holding that the Double
Jeopardy Clause, though applicable in the capital sentencing context,
see Bullington v. Missouri, 451 U. S. 430, does not extend to noncapital
sentencing proceedings.

Held: The Double Jeopardy Clause does not preclude retrial on a

prior conviction allegation in noncapital sentencing proceedings.
Pp. 727-734.

(a) Historically, this Court has found double jeopardy protections
inapplicable to sentencing proceedings because the determinations at
issue do not place a defendant in jeopardy for an "offense." Nor can
sentencing determinations generally be analogized to an acquittal. See
United States v. DiFrancesco, 449 U. S. 117, 134. In Bullington, this

722 MONGE v. CALIFORNIA

Syllabus
Court established a "narrow exception" to the general rule that double
jeopardy principles have no application in the sentencing context.
There, after a capital defendant received a life sentence from the original sentencing jury and then obtained a new trial, the State announced
its intention to seek the death penalty again. This Court imposed a
double jeopardy bar, finding that the first jury's deliberations bore the
hallmarks of a trial on guilt or innocence because the jury was presented
with a choice between two alternatives together with standards to guide
their decision, the prosecutor had to establish facts beyond a reasonable
doubt, and the evidence was introduced in a separate proceeding that
formally resembled a trial. Moreover, the Bullington Court reasoned
that the embarrassment, expense, ordeal, anxiety, and insecurity that a
capital defendant faces are at least equivalent to that faced by any defendant during the guilt phase of a criminal trial. Bullington's rule
has since been applied to a capital sentencing scheme in which a judge
made the original determination to impose a life sentence. See Arizona v. Rumsey, 467 U. S. 203, 209-210. Pp. 727-731.

(b) Bullington's rationale does not apply to California's noncapital
sentencing proceedings. Even if those proceedings have the hallmarks
identified in Bullington, a critical component of that case's reasoning
was the capital sentencing context. In many respects, a capital trial's
penalty phase is a continuation of the trial on guilt or innocence of capital murder. The death penalty is unique in both its severity and its
finality, and the qualitative difference between a capital sentence and
other penalties calls for a greater degree of reliability when it is imposed. That need for reliability accords with one of the central concerns animating the double jeopardy prohibition: preventing States from
making repeated attempts to convict, thereby enhancing the possibility
that an innocent person may be found guilty. Moreover, this Court has
previously suggested that Bullington's rationale is confined to the
unique circumstances of a capital sentencing proceeding, Caspari v.

Bohlen, 510 U. S. 383, 392, and has cited Bullington as an example
of the heightened procedural protections accorded capital defendants,
Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, 686-687. Pp. 731-733.

(c) Petitioner attempts to minimize the relevance of the death penalty
context by arguing that the application of double jeopardy principles
turns on the nature rather than the consequences of the proceeding.
Bullington's holding, however, turns on both the trial-like proceedings
at issue and the severity of the penalty at stake. In this Court's death
penalty jurisprudence, moreover, the nature and the consequences of
capital sentencing proceedings are intertwined. States' implementation of trial-like protections in noncapital sentencing proceedings is a

Opinion of the Court
Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case presents the question whether the Double Jeop-ardy Clause, which we have found applicable in the capital

sentencing context, see Bullington v. Missouri, 451 U. S. 430(1981), extends to noncapital sentencing proceedings. We
hold that it does not, and accordingly affirm the judgment ofthe California Supreme Court.

I
Petitioner was charged under California law with onecount of using a minor to sell marijuana, Cal. Health & Safety

Code Ann. $ 11361(a) (West 1991), one count of sale or trans-portation of marijuana, $ 11360(a), and one count of possession of marijuana for sale, $ 11359. In the information, theState also notified petitioner that it would seek to prove two
sentence enhancement allegations: that petitioner had pre-viously been convicted of assault and that he had served a
prison term for that offense, see Cal. Penal Code Ann.$$ 245(a)(1), 667(e)(1), and 667.5 (West Supp. 1998).

Under California's "three-strikes" law, a defendant con-victed of a felony who has two qualifying prior convictions
for "serious felonies" receives a minimum sentence of 25years to life; when the instant conviction was preceded by
one serious felony offense, the court doubles a defendant'sterm of imprisonment. $$ 667(d)(1) and (e)(1)-(2).

Opinion of the Court
sonally used a dangerous or deadly weapon during the as-sault. $$ 1192.7(c)(8) and (23). According to California law,

a number of procedural safeguards surround the assessmentof prior conviction allegations: Defendants may invoke the
right to a jury trial, the right to confront witnesses, and the
privilege against self-incrimination; the prosecution mustprove the allegations beyond a reasonable doubt; and the

rules of evidence apply. See, e. g., 16 Cal. 4th 826, 833-834,941 P. 2d 1121, 1126 (1997).

Here, petitioner waived his right to a jury trial on thesentencing issues, and the court granted his motion to bifurcate the proceedings. After a jury entered a guilty verdict
on the substantive offenses, the truth of the prior conviction
allegations was argued before the court. The prosecutor asserted that petitioner had personally used a stick in committing the assault, see Tr. 189-190 (June 12, 1995), App. 12, but
introduced into evidence only a prison record demonstrating
that petitioner had been convicted of assault with a deadly
weapon and had served a prison term for the offense, see
People's Exh. 1 (filed June 12, 1995), App. 3-6. The trial
court found both sentencing allegations true and imposed an
11-year term of imprisonment: 5 years on count one, doubled
to 10 under the three-strikes law, and a 1-year enhancement
for the prior prison term. The court also stayed a 3-year
sentence on count 2 and ordered the 2-year sentence on count
3 to be served concurrently.

Petitioner appealed, and the California Court of Appeal,
on its own motion, requested briefing as to whether sufficient
evidence supported the finding that petitioner had a qualifying prior conviction. The State conceded that the record of
the sentencing proceedings did not contain proof beyond a
reasonable doubt that petitioner had personally inflicted
great bodily injury or used a deadly weapon, but requested
another opportunity to prove the allegations on remand.
See Respondent's Supplemental Brief (Cal. App.), pp. 2-3,
App. 33-35. The court, however, determined both that the

Opinion of the Court
evidence was insufficient to trigger the sentence enhance-ment and that a remand for retrial on the allegation would

violate double jeopardy principles.The California Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeal's ruling that the Double Jeopardy Clause bars retrial
of prior conviction allegations. The three-justice pluralitynoted this Court's traditional reluctance to apply double

jeopardy principles to sentencing proceedings and concludedthat the exception recognized in

Bullington, supra, did not
apply. In Bullington, we held that a capital defendant whohad received a life sentence during a penalty phase that bore

"the hallmarks of [a] trial on guilt or innocence" could not be
resentenced to death upon retrial following appeal. Here,
the plurality acknowledged that California's proceedings to
assess the truth of prior conviction allegations have the hallmarks of a trial, but it found Bullington distinguishable on
several grounds. First, the plurality cited statements by
this Court indicating that Bullington's rationale is confined
to the unique circumstances of capital cases. See 16 Cal.
4th, at 836-837, 941 P. 2d, at 1128 (citing Caspari v. Bohlen,
510 U. S. 383, 392 (1994); Pennsylvania v. Goldhammer, 474
U. S. 28, 30 (1985) (per curiam)). The plurality also reasoned that capital sentencing procedures are mandated by
the Supreme Court's interpretation of the Federal Constitution, whereas the procedural protections accorded in California's sentence enhancement proceedings rest on statutory
grounds. 16 Cal. 4th, at 837, 941 P. 2d, at 1128. The plurality then cited the breadth and subjectivity of the factual determinations at issue in the capital sentencing context, as
well as the financial and emotional burden that the penalty
phase of a capital case places on a defendant. Id., at 838-
839, 941 P. 2d, at 1129. Finally, the plurality explained that
a qualifying strike involves a finding of a particular "status"
that may be made from the record of the prior conviction,
while the jury's sentencing determination in a capital case
"depends on the specific facts of the defendant's present

Opinion of the Court
crime, as well as an overall assessment of the defendant'scharacter." Id., at 839, 941 P. 2d, at 1130.

The concurring justice who provided the fourth vote toreverse noted that retrial on a prior conviction allegation
would not require the factfinder to reevaluate the evidenceunderlying the substantive offense. Accordingly, she concluded that a second attempt at proving the allegation wouldnot unfairly subject a defendant to the risk of repeated
prosecution within the meaning of the Double JeopardyClause.

Id., at 846-847, 941 P. 2d, at 1134-1135 (Brown,J., concurring). Three justices dissented, asserting that

under Bullington's rationale, the Double Jeopardy Clauseprecludes successive efforts to prove prior conviction allegations. Id., at 847, 941 P. 2d, at 1135 (opinion of Wer-degar, J.).

The California Supreme Court's decision deepened a con-flict among the state courts as to

Bullington's application tononcapital sentencing. Compare, e. g., State v. Hennings,

100 Wash. 2d 379, 670 P. 2d 256 (1983), with People v. Levin,157 Ill. 2d 138, 623 N. E. 2d 317 (1993). Prior to this Court's
determination that the nonretroactivity rule of Teague v.
Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989), would bar the extension of Bull-ington to noncapital sentencing proceedings on federal habeas review, see Caspari, supra, the Federal Courts of Ap-peals had reached disparate conclusions as well. Compare,
e. g., Briggs v. Procunier, 764 F. 2d 368, 371 (CA5 1985), with
Denton v. Duckworth, 873 F. 2d 144 (CA7), cert. denied, 493U. S. 941 (1989). In view of the conflicting authority on the

issue, we granted certiorari, 522 U. S. 1072 (1998).

The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment, ap-plicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment,

tions for the same offense after acquittal or conviction andagainst multiple criminal punishments for the same offense.

See North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U. S. 711, 717 (1969).Historically, we have found double jeopardy protections inapplicable to sentencing proceedings, see Bullington, 451
U. S., at 438, because the determinations at issue do not placea defendant in jeopardy for an "offense," see,

e. g., Nichols v.
United States, 511 U. S. 738, 747 (1994) (noting that repeat-offender laws " `penaliz[e] only the last offense committed by

the defendant' "). Nor have sentence enhancements beenconstrued as additional punishment for the previous offense;
rather, they act to increase a sentence "because of the manner in which [the defendant] committed the crime of conviction." United States v. Watts, 519 U. S. 148, 154 (1997)
(per curiam); see also Witte v. United States, 515 U. S. 389,
398 - 399 (1995). An enhanced sentence imposed on a
persistent offender thus "is not to be viewed as either a new
jeopardy or additional penalty for the earlier crimes" but as
"a stiffened penalty for the latest crime, which is considered
to be an aggravated offense because a repetitive one."
Gryger v. Burke, 334 U. S. 728, 732 (1948); cf. Moore v. Missouri, 159 U. S. 673, 678 (1895) ("[T]he State may undoubtedly provide that persons who have been before convicted of
crime may suffer severer punishment for subsequent offences than for a first offence").

Justice Scalia insists that the recidivism enhancement
the Court confronts here in fact constitutes an element of
petitioner's offense. His dissent addresses an issue that was
neither considered by the state courts nor discussed in petitioner's brief before this Court. In any event, Justice
Scalia acknowledges, post, at 741, that his argument is
squarely foreclosed by our decision in Almendarez-Torres v.
United States, 523 U. S. 224 (1998). One could imagine circumstances in which fundamental fairness would require
that a particular fact be treated as an element of the offense,
see post, at 738 (Scalia, J., dissenting), but there are also

Opinion of the Court
cases in which fairness calls for defining a fact as a sentenc-ing factor. A defendant might not, for example, wish to simultaneously profess his innocence of a drug offense and dis-pute the amount of drugs allegedly involved. Cf.

Gregg v.
Georgia, 428 U. S. 153, 190-195 (1976) ( joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.) (discussing the benefits ofbifurcated proceedings in capital cases). In part for that

reason, the Court has rejected an absolute rule that anenhancement constitutes an element of the offense any time
that it increases the maximum sentence to which a defendantis exposed. See

Almendarez-Torres, supra. Under California law, the maximum sentence applicable to a first offender who uses a minor to sell drugs is 7 years, and a judge
may double that sentence to 14 years where the offender has
previously been convicted of a qualifying felony. See Cal.
Health & Safety Code Ann. $ 11361(a) (West 1991). That increase falls well within the range that the Court has found
to be constitutionally permissible. See Almendarez-Torres,
supra (upholding a potential 18-year increase to a 2-year
sentence). Thus, the sentencing determination here did not
place petitioner in jeopardy for an "offense."

Sentencing decisions favorable to the defendant, moreover,
cannot generally be analogized to an acquittal. We have
held that where an appeals court overturns a conviction on
the ground that the prosecution proffered insufficient evidence of guilt, that finding is comparable to an acquittal, and
the Double Jeopardy Clause precludes a second trial. See
Burks v. United States, 437 U. S. 1, 16 (1978). Where a similar failure of proof occurs in a sentencing proceeding, however, the analogy is inapt. The pronouncement of sentence
simply does not "have the qualities of constitutional finality
that attend an acquittal." United States v. DiFrancesco,
449 U. S. 117, 134 (1980); see also Bullington, supra, at 438
("The imposition of a particular sentence usually is not regarded as an `acquittal' of any more severe sentence that
could have been imposed").

524US2 Unit: $U98 [09-06-00 19:40:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN
730 MONGE v. CALIFORNIA

Opinion of the Court
The Double Jeopardy Clause "does not provide the defend-ant with the right to know at any specific moment in time

what the exact limit of his punishment will turn out to be."
DiFrancesco, 449 U. S., at 137. Consequently, it is a "wellestablished part of our constitutional jurisprudence" that the
guarantee against double jeopardy neither prevents theprosecution from seeking review of a sentence nor restricts

the length of a sentence imposed upon retrial after a defend-ant's successful appeal. See

id., at 135; Pearce, supra, at
720; see also Stroud v. United States, 251 U. S. 15, 18 (1919)(despite a harsher sentence on retrial, the defendant was not

"placed in second jeopardy within the meaning of the
Constitution").

Our opinion in Bullington established a "narrow exception" to the general rule that double jeopardy principles have
no application in the sentencing context. See Schiro v. Farley, 510 U. S. 222, 231 (1994). In Bullington, a capital defendant had received a sentence of life imprisonment from
the original sentencing jury. The defendant subsequently
obtained a new trial on the ground that the court had permitted prospective women jurors to claim automatic exemption
from jury service in violation of the Sixth and Fourteenth
Amendments. 451 U. S., at 436. When the State announced its intention to seek the death penalty again, the
defendant alleged a double jeopardy violation. We determined that the first jury's deliberations bore the "hallmarks
of the trial on guilt or innocence," id., at 439, because the
jury was presented with a choice between two alternatives
together with standards to guide their decision, the prosecution undertook the burden of establishing facts beyond a reasonable doubt, and the evidence was introduced in a separate
proceeding that formally resembled a trial, id., at 438. In
light of the jury's binary determination and the heightened
procedural protections, we found the proceeding distinct
from traditional sentencing, in which "it is impossible to conclude that a sentence less than the statutory maximum `con524US2 Unit: $U98 [09-06-00 19:40:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN

731Cite as: 524 U. S. 721 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
stitute[s] a decision to the effect that the government hasfailed to prove its case.' "

Id., at 443 (quoting Burks, supra,
at 15).Moreover, we reasoned that the "embarrassment, expense

and ordeal" as well as the "anxiety and insecurity" that a
capital defendant faces "are at least equivalent to that facedby any defendant at the guilt phase of a criminal trial." 451

U. S., at 445. And we cited the "unacceptably high risk"that repeated attempts to persuade a jury to impose the
death penalty would lead to an erroneous capital sentence.
Id., at 445-446. We later extended the rule set forth in
Bullington to a capital sentencing scheme in which the
judge, as opposed to a jury, had initially determined that a
life sentence was appropriate. See Arizona v. Rumsey, 467
U. S. 203, 209-210 (1984).

Petitioner contends that the rationale for imposing a double jeopardy bar in Bullington and Rumsey applies with
equal force to California's proceedings to determine the
truth of a prior conviction allegation. Like the Missouri
capital sentencing scheme at issue in Bullington, petitioner
argues, the sentencing proceedings here have the "hallmarks
of a trial on guilt or innocence" because the sentencer makes
an objective finding as to whether the prosecution has
proved a historical fact beyond a reasonable doubt. The determination whether a defendant in fact has qualifying prior
convictions may be distinguished, petitioner maintains, from
the normative decisions typical of traditional sentencing. In
petitioner's view, once a defendant has obtained a favorable
finding on such an issue, the State should not be permitted
to retry the allegation.

Even assuming, however, that the proceeding on the prior
conviction allegation has the "hallmarks" of a trial that we
identified in Bullington, a critical component of our reasoning in that case was the capital sentencing context. The
penalty phase of a capital trial is undertaken to assess the
gravity of a particular offense and to determine whether it

524US2 Unit: $U98 [09-06-00 19:40:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN
732 MONGE v. CALIFORNIA

Opinion of the Court
warrants the ultimate punishment; it is in many respects acontinuation of the trial on guilt or innocence of capital murder. "It is of vital importance" that the decisions made inthat context "be, and appear to be, based on reason rather
than caprice or emotion." Gardner v. Florida, 430 U. S. 349,
358 (1977). Because the death penalty is unique "in both itsseverity and its finality,"

id., at 357, we have recognized an
acute need for reliability in capital sentencing proceedings.See

Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586, 604 (1978) (opinion of
Burger, C. J.) (stating that the "qualitative difference be-tween death and other penalties calls for a greater degree

of reliability when the death sentence is imposed"); see also
Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, 704 (1984) (Brennan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) ("[W]e have
consistently required that capital proceedings be policed at
all stages by an especially vigilant concern for procedural
fairness and for the accuracy of factfinding").

That need for reliability accords with one of the central
concerns animating the constitutional prohibition against
double jeopardy. As the Court explained in Green v. United
States, 355 U. S. 184 (1957), the Double Jeopardy Clause prevents States from "mak[ing] repeated attempts to convict an
individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to
embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to
live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity, as well
as enhancing the possibility that even though innocent he
may be found guilty." Id., at 187-188. Indeed, we cited the
heightened interest in accuracy in the Bullington decision
itself. We noted that in a capital sentencing proceeding, as
in a criminal trial, " `the interests of the defendant [are] of
such magnitude that . . . they have been protected by standards of proof designed to exclude as nearly as possible the
likelihood of an erroneous judgment.' " 451 U. S., at 441
(quoting Addington v. Texas, 441 U. S. 418, 423-424 (1979)).

Moreover, we have suggested in earlier cases that Bullington's rationale is confined to the "unique circumstances of

524US2 Unit: $U98 [09-06-00 19:40:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN

733Cite as: 524 U. S. 721 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
a capital sentencing proceeding." Caspari, 510 U. S., at 392;
see also Goldhammer, 474 U. S., at 30 ("[T]he decisions of
this Court `clearly establish that a sentenc[ing in a noncapital case] does not have the qualities of constitutional finality
that attend an acquittal' ") (quoting DiFrancesco, 449 U. S.,
at 134). In addition, we have cited Bullington as an example of the heightened procedural protections accorded capital
defendants. See Strickland, supra, at 686-687 ("A capital
sentencing proceeding . . . is sufficiently like a trial in its
adversarial format and in the existence of standards for decision, see [Bullington], that counsel's role in the proceeding
is comparable to counsel's role at trial").

In an attempt to minimize the relevance of the death penalty context, petitioner argues that the application of double
jeopardy principles turns on the nature rather than the consequences of the proceeding. For example, petitioner notes
that Bullington did not overrule the Court's decision in
Stroud v. United States, 251 U. S. 15 (1919)--which found
the double jeopardy bar inapplicable to a particular capital
sentencing proceeding--but rather distinguished it on the
ground that the proceeding at issue did not bear the hallmarks of a trial on guilt or innocence. Stroud predates our
decisions in Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238 (1972) (per
curiam), and Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153 (1976) ( joint
opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.); it was decided
at a time when "no significant constitutional difference between the death penalty and lesser punishments for crime
had been expressly recognized by this Court." See Gardner, supra, at 357 (opinion of Stevens, J.). Consequently,
the capital sentencing procedures at issue in Stroud did not
resemble a trial, and the Court confronted a different question in that case. The holding of Bullington turns on both
the trial-like proceedings at issue and the severity of the
penalty at stake. That the Court focused on the absence of
procedural safeguards in distinguishing an earlier capital

734 MONGE v. CALIFORNIA

Stevens, J., dissenting
case does not mean that the Bullington decision rests on a
purely procedural rationale.

In our death penalty jurisprudence, moreover, the nature
and the consequences of capital sentencing proceedings are
intertwined. We have held that "in capital cases the fundamental respect for humanity underlying the Eighth Amendment requires consideration of the character and record of
the individual offender and the circumstances of the particular offense as a constitutionally indispensable part of the
process of inflicting the penalty of death." Woodson v.
North Carolina, 428 U. S. 280, 304 (1976) (plurality opinion)
(citation omitted). Where noncapital sentencing proceedings contain trial-like protections, that is a matter of legislative grace, not constitutional command. Many States have
chosen to implement procedural safeguards to protect defendants who may face dramatic increases in their sentences
as a result of recidivism enhancements. We do not believe
that because the States have done so, we are compelled to
extend the double jeopardy bar. Indeed, were we to apply
double jeopardy here, we might create disincentives that
would diminish these important procedural protections.

* * *
We conclude that Bullington's rationale is confined to the
unique circumstances of capital sentencing and that the Double Jeopardy Clause does not preclude retrial on a prior conviction allegation in the noncapital sentencing context. Accordingly, the judgment of the California Supreme Court is
affirmed. It is so ordered.

ing." Burks v. United States, 437 U. S. 1, 11 (1978).1 Today,the Court ignores this cardinal principle. In this case, the

prosecution attempted to prove that petitioner had pre-viously been convicted of a qualifying felony. If the prosecution had proved this fact, petitioner would have automati-cally been sentenced to an additional five years in prison.

2

The prosecution, however, failed to prove its case.3 Conse-quently, the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits a " `second

bite at the apple.' " Id., at 17.Until today, the Court has never held that a retrial or resentencing is permissible when the evidence in the first pro-ceeding was

insufficient; instead, the Court has consistentlydrawn a line between insufficiency of the evidence and legal

errors that infect the first proceeding.4 In his unanimous

1 See also, e. g., Poland v. Arizona, 476 U. S. 147, 152 (1986) (reprosecution or resentencing prohibited whenever "a jury agrees or an appellate
court decides that the prosecution has not proved its case" (internal quotation marks omitted)); cf. Schiro v. Farley, 510 U. S. 222, 231-232 (1994)
("The state is entitled to `one fair opportunity' to prosecute a defendant,
. . . and that opportunity extends not only to prosecution at the guilt phase,
but also to present evidence at an ensuing sentencing proceeding").

2 The finding of this fact would have also increased petitioner's sentencing range. See Cal. Health & Safety Code Ann. $ 11361(a) (West 1991).
This case, then, is factually different from Caspari v. Bohlen, 510 U. S.
383, 386-387 (1994), as the factual finding in that case did not automatically
increase the respondent's sentence or affect his sentencing range.

3 The California appellate court concluded that "[t]here was insufficient

evidence that [petitioner] suffered a prior felony conviction" within the
meaning of the "three-strikes" law. App. 41 (emphasis omitted). It is
immaterial, of course, that this determination was made by an appellate
court rather than by the trial judge or jury. Burks v. United States, 437
U. S. 1, 11 (1978). The State concedes that the evidence was insufficient.

4 See, e. g., Poland, 476 U. S., at 154 ("[The Arizona Supreme Court] did

not hold that the prosecution had failed to prove its case . . . . Indeed,
the court clearly indicated that there had been no such failure by remarking that `the trial court mistook the law when it did not find that the

opinion for the Court in Burks v. United States, Chief JusticeBurger emphasized this critical difference, i. e., "between reversals due to trial error and those resulting from eviden-tiary insufficiency." Id., at 15. He specifically noted "that
the failure to make this distinction has contributed substan-tially to the present state of conceptual confusion existing in
this area of the law," ibid., and concluded that in order tohold, as we did, "that the Double Jeopardy Clause precludes
a second trial once the reviewing court has found the evi-dence legally insufficient," it was necessary to overrule several prior cases, id., at 18. The Court's opinion today re-flects the same failure to recognize the critical importance of
this distinction.I agree that California's decision to "implement procedural
safeguards to protect defendants who may face dramatic in-creases in their sentences as a result of recidivism enhancements," ante, at 734, should not create a constitutional ob-ligation that would not otherwise exist. But the fact
that so many States have done so--not just recently, but formany years

5--is powerful evidence that they were simply

responding to the traditional understanding of fundamentalfairness that produced decisions such as In re Winship, 397

U. S. 358 (1970),6 and Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U. S. 684
Court of Appeals may increase the sentence only if the trial court has
abused its discretion or employed unlawful procedures or made clearly
erroneous findings. The appellate court thus is empowered to correct
only a legal error" (emphasis added)); Bozza v. United States, 330 U. S.
160, 166-167 (1947) (error of law that infects a sentence may be corrected
on appeal).

5 See, e. g., cases cited in Annot., 58 A. L. R. 59-62 (1929); cases cited in

Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U. S. 224, 256-257 (1998) (Scalia,
J., dissenting); see also ante, at 734 ("Many States have chosen to implement
procedural safeguards to protect defendants who may face dramatic increases in their sentences as a result of recidivism enhancements").

6 In Winship, despite the fact that the Court had never held "that proof

beyond a reasonable doubt is either expressly or impliedly commanded by
any provision of the Constitution," 397 U. S., at 377 (Black, J., dissenting),
the traditional importance of that standard that dated "at least from our

(1975).7 It is this same traditional understanding of funda-mental fairness--dating back centuries to the common-law

plea of autrefois acquit and buttressed by a special interestin finality--that undergirds the Double Jeopardy Clause.

I respectfully dissent.

Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Souter and Justice Ginsburg join, dissenting.

I agree with the Court 's determination that Bullington v.
Missouri, 451 U. S. 430 (1981), should not be extended, andits conclusion that the Double Jeopardy Clause does not

apply to noncapital sentencing proceedings. I do not, how-ever, agree with the Court's assumption that only a sentencing proceeding was at issue here.Like many other guarantees in the Bill of Rights, the Double Jeopardy Clause makes sense only against the backdrop
of traditional principles of Anglo-American criminal law. Inthat tradition, defendants are charged with "offence[s]." A

criminal "offence" is composed of "elements," which are fac-tual components that must be proved by the state beyond a
reasonable doubt and submitted (if the defendant so desires)
to a jury. Conviction of an "offence" renders the defendant
eligible for a range of potential punishments, from which a
sentencing authority ( judge or jury) then selects the most

early years as a Nation," id., at 361, justified our conclusion "that the Due
Process Clause protects the accused against conviction except upon proof
beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime
with which he is charged," id., at 364.

7 In Mullaney, we unanimously extended the protection of Winship to

determinations that go not to a defendant's guilt or innocence, but simply
to the length of his sentence. 421 U. S., at 697-698; see also AlmendarezTorres, 523 U. S., at 251-252 (Scalia, J., dissenting).

8 Justice Scalia accurately characterizes the potential consequences of

today's decision as "sinister." Post, at 739. It is not, however, California
that has taken "the first steps" down the road the Court follows today.
It was the Court's decision in McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U. S. 79
(1986).

524US2 Unit: $U98 [09-06-00 19:40:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Scalia, J., dissenting
appropriate. That sentencer often considers new factual issues and additional evidence under much less demanding
proof requirements than apply at the conviction stage. The
fundamental distinction between facts that are elements
of a criminal offense and facts that go only to the sentence
provides the foundation for our entire double jeopardy jurisprudence--including the "same elements" test for determining whether two "offence[s]" are "the same," see Blockburger v. United States, 284 U. S. 299 (1932), and the rule (at
issue here) that the Clause protects an expectation of finality
with respect to offences but not sentences. The same distinction also delimits the boundaries of other important constitutional rights, like the Sixth Amendment right to trial by
jury and the right to proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

I do not believe that that distinction is (as the Court seems
to assume) simply a matter of the label affixed to each fact
by the legislature. Suppose that a State repealed all of the
violent crimes in its criminal code and replaced them with
only one offense, "knowingly causing injury to another,"
bearing a penalty of 30 days in prison, but subject to a series
of "sentencing enhancements" authorizing additional punishment up to life imprisonment or death on the basis of various
levels of mens rea, severity of injury, and other surrounding
circumstances. Could the State then grant the defendant
a jury trial, with requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, solely on the question whether he "knowingly
cause[d] injury to another," but leave it for the judge to determine by a preponderance of the evidence whether the defendant acted intentionally or accidentally, whether he used
a deadly weapon, and whether the victim ultimately died
from the injury the defendant inflicted? If the protections
extended to criminal defendants by the Bill of Rights can be
so easily circumvented, most of them would be, to borrow a
phrase from Justice Field, "vain and idle enactment[s], which
accomplished nothing, and most unnecessarily excited Con524US2 Unit: $U98 [09-06-00 19:40:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN

gress and the people on [their] passage." Slaughter-House
Cases, 16 Wall. 36, 96 (1873).1

Although California's system is not nearly that sinister, it
takes the first steps down that road. The California Code
is full of "sentencing enhancements" that look exactly like
separate crimes, and that expose the defendant to additional
maximum punishment. Cal. Penal Code $ 12022.5 (1982) is
typical: "[A]ny person who personally uses a firearm in the
commission or attempted commission of a felony shall . . . be
punished by an additional term of imprisonment in the state
prison for three, four, or five years." Compare that provision with its federal counterpart, 18 U. S. C. $ 924(c)(1), which
provides that "[w]hoever, during and in relation to any crime
of violence or drug trafficking crime . . . uses or carries a
firearm, shall, in addition to the punishment provided for
such crime of violence or drug trafficking crime, be sentenced to imprisonment for five years." Everyone agrees
that 18 U. S. C. $ 924(c)(1) describes a separate crime entitling those who are charged to the constitutional protections
that accompany criminal convictions. Indeed, the undisputed fact that each of the elements of $ 924(c)(1) must be

1 The Court suggests that "fundamental fairness" will sometimes call for
treating a particular fact as a sentencing factor rather than an element,
even if it increases the defendant's maximum sentencing exposure, because
"[a] defendant might not, for example, wish to simultaneously profess his
innocence of a drug offense and dispute the amount of drugs allegedly
involved." Ante, at 729. Even if I agreed that putting a defendant to
such a choice would be fundamentally unfair, I see no reason to assume
that defendants would be eager to pursue such a strategy at the cost of
forfeiting their traditional rights to jury trial and proof beyond a reasonable doubt. But in any event, there is no need to contemplate such Faustian bargains. If simultaneous consideration of two elements would be
genuinely prejudicial to the defendant (as, for example, when one of the
elements involves the defendant's prior criminal history), the trial can be
bifurcated without sacrificing jury factfinding in the second phase. See
Almendarez-Torres, 523 U. S. 224, 261, 269 (1998) (Scalia, J., dissenting).

submitted to a jury and found beyond a reasonable doubt,combined with the fact that many courts were mistaken as

to what those elements consisted of, has created considerablejuridical chaos in recent years. See,

e. g., Bailey v. United
States, 516 U. S. 137 (1995); Bousley v. United States, 523
U. S. 614 (1998). Perhaps Congress should have taken a les-son from the California Legislature, which (if my worst fears

about today's holding are justified) may have stumbled uponthe El Dorado sought by many in vain since the beginning
of the Republic: a means of dispensing with inconvenient con-stitutional "rights." For now, California has used this gimmick only to eviscerate the Double Jeopardy Clause; it still
provides a right to notice, jury trial, and proof beyond a reasonable doubt on "enhancement" allegations as a matter of
state law. But if the Court is right today, those protections
could be withdrawn tomorrow.

Earlier this Term, in Almendarez-Torres v. United States,
523 U. S. 224 (1998), I discussed our precedents bearing on
this issue and concluded that it was a grave and doubtful
question whether the Constitution permits a fact that increases the maximum sentence to which a defendant is exposed to be treated as a sentencing enhancement rather than
an element of a criminal offense. See id., at 260 (dissenting opinion). I stopped short of answering that question,
because I thought the doctrine of constitutional doubt required us to interpret the federal statute at issue as setting
forth an element rather than an enhancement, thereby avoiding the problem. Ibid. Since the present case involves a
state statute already authoritatively construed as an enhancement by the California Supreme Court, I must now
answer the constitutional question. Petitioner Monge was
convicted of the crime of using a minor to sell marijuana,

several additional facts that California and the Court havechosen to label "sentence enhancement allegations." However California chooses to divide and label its criminal code,I believe that for federal constitutional purposes those extra
four years are attributable to conviction of a new crime.2Monge was functionally acquitted of that crime when the
California Court of Appeal held that the evidence adduced
at trial was insufficient to sustain the trial court's "enhance-ment" findings, see

Burks v. United States, 437 U. S. 1, 18
(1978). Giving the State a second chance to prove himguilty of that same crime would violate the very core of the

double jeopardy prohibition.That disposition would contradict, of course, the Court's
holding in Almendarez-Torres that "recidivism" findings donot have to be treated as elements of the offense,

even if they
increase the maximum punishment to which the defendant is
exposed. That holding was in my view a grave constitutional error affecting the most fundamental of rights. I
note, in any event, that Almendarez-Torres left open the
question whether "enhancements" that increase the maximum sentence and that do not involve the defendant's prior
criminal history are valid. That qualification is an implicit
limitation on the Court's holding today.

I respectfully dissent.

2 The Court contends that this issue "was neither considered by the state
courts nor discussed in petitioner's brief before this Court." Ante, at 728.
But Monge has argued consistently that reconsideration of the enhancement issue would violate the Double Jeopardy Clause. He did not explicitly contend that the enhancement was in reality an element of the offense
with which he was charged, but I believe that was fairly included within
the argument he did make. "When an issue or claim is properly before
the court, the court is not limited to the particular legal theories advanced
by the parties, but rather retains the independent power to identify and
apply the proper construction of governing law." Kamen v. Kemper

BURLINGTON INDUSTRIES, INC. v. ELLERTH
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe seventh circuit

No. 97-569. Argued April 22, 1998--Decided June 26, 1998
Respondent Kimberly Ellerth quit her job after 15 months as a salesperson in one of petitioner Burlington Industries' many divisions, allegedly
because she had been subjected to constant sexual harassment by one
of her supervisors, Ted Slowik. Slowik was a midlevel manager who
had authority to hire and promote employees, subject to higher approval, but was not considered a policymaker. Against a background
of repeated boorish and offensive remarks and gestures allegedly made
by Slowik, Ellerth places particular emphasis on three incidents where
Slowik's comments could be construed as threats to deny her tangible
job benefits. Ellerth refused all of Slowik's advances, yet suffered no
tangible retaliation and was, in fact, promoted once. Moreover, she
never informed anyone in authority about Slowik's conduct, despite
knowing Burlington had a policy against sexual harassment. In filing
this lawsuit, Ellerth alleged Burlington engaged in sexual harassment
and forced her constructive discharge, in violation of Title VII of the
Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e et seq. The District Court
granted Burlington summary judgment. The Seventh Circuit en banc
reversed in a decision that produced eight separate opinions and no consensus for a controlling rationale. Among other things, those opinions
focused on whether Ellerth's claim could be categorized as one of quid
pro quo harassment, and on whether the standard for an employer's
liability on such a claim should be vicarious liability or negligence.

Held: Under Title VII, an employee who refuses the unwelcome and

threatening sexual advances of a supervisor, yet suffers no adverse,
tangible job consequences, may recover against the employer without
showing the employer is negligent or otherwise at fault for the supervisor's actions, but the employer may interpose an affirmative defense.
Pp. 751-766.

(a) The Court assumes an important premise yet to be established: A
trier of fact could find in Slowik's remarks numerous threats to retaliate
against Ellerth if she denied some sexual liberties. The threats, however, were not carried out. Cases based on carried-out threats are referred to often as "quid pro quo" cases, as distinct from bothersome
attentions or sexual remarks sufficient to create a "hostile work environment." Those two terms do not appear in Title VII, which forbids only

"discriminat[ion] against any individual with respect to his . . . terms
[or] conditions . . . of employment, because of . . . sex." $ 2000e-2(a)(1).
In Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477 U. S. 57, 65, this Court
distinguished between the two concepts, saying both are cognizable
under Title VII, though a hostile environment claim requires harassment that is severe or pervasive. Meritor did not discuss the distinction for its bearing upon an employer's liability for discrimination, but
held, with no further specifics, that agency principles controlled on this
point. Id., at 72. Nevertheless, in Meritor's wake, Courts of Appeals
held that, if the plaintiff established a quid pro quo claim, the employer
was subject to vicarious liability. This rule encouraged Title VII plaintiffs to state their claims in quid pro quo terms, which in turn put expansive pressure on the definition. For example, the question presented here is phrased as whether Ellerth can state a quid pro quo
claim, but the issue of real concern to the parties is whether Burlington
has vicarious liability, rather than liability limited to its own negligence.
This Court nonetheless believes the two terms are of limited utility.
To the extent they illustrate the distinction between cases involving a
carried-out threat and offensive conduct in general, they are relevant
when there is a threshold question whether a plaintiff can prove discrimination. Hence, Ellerth's claim involves only unfulfilled threats, so
it is a hostile work environment claim requiring a showing of severe
or pervasive conduct. This Court accepts the District Court's finding

that Ellerth made such a showing. When discrimination is thus
proved, the factors discussed below, not the categories quid pro quo
and hostile work environment, control on the issue of vicarious liability.
Pp. 751-754.

(b) In deciding whether an employer has vicarious liability in a case
such as this, the Court turns to agency law principles, for Title VII
defines the term "employer" to include "agents." $ 2000e(b). Given
this express direction, the Court concludes a uniform and predictable
standard must be established as a matter of federal law. The Court
relies on the general common law of agency, rather than on the law of
any particular State. Community for Creative Non-Violence v. Reid,
490 U. S. 730, 740. The Restatement (Second) of Agency (hereinafter
Restatement) is a useful beginning point, although common-law principles may not be wholly transferable to Title VII. See Meritor, supra,
at 72. Pp. 754-755.

(c) A master is subject to liability for the torts of his servants committed while acting in the scope of their employment. Restatement

$ 219(1). Although such torts generally may be either negligent or intentional, sexual harassment under Title VII presupposes intentional
conduct. An intentional tort is within the scope of employment when

actuated, at least in part, by a purpose to serve the employer. Id.,

$$ 228(1)(c), 230. Courts of Appeals have held, however, a supervisor
acting out of gender-based animus or a desire to fulfill sexual urges may
be actuated by personal motives unrelated and even antithetical to the
employer's objectives. Thus, the general rule is that sexual harassment by a supervisor is not conduct within the scope of employment.
Pp. 755-757.

(d) However, scope of employment is not the only basis for employer
liability under agency principles. An employer is subject to liability for
the torts of its employees acting outside the scope of their employment
when, inter alia, the employer itself was negligent or reckless, Restatement $ 219(2)(b), or the employee purported to act or to speak on behalf
of the employer and there was reliance upon apparent authority, or he
was aided in accomplishing the tort by the existence of the agency relation, id., $ 219(2)(d). An employer is negligent, and therefore subject to
liability under $ 219(2)(b), if it knew or should have known about sexual
harassment and failed to stop it. Negligence sets a minimum standard
for Title VII liability; but Ellerth seeks to invoke the more stringent
standard of vicarious liability. Section 219(2)(d) makes an employer vicariously liable for sexual harassment by an employee who uses apparent authority (the apparent authority standard), or who was "aided in
accomplishing the tort by the existence of the agency relation" (the
aided in the agency relation standard). Pp. 758-759.

(e) As a general rule, apparent authority is relevant where the agent
purports to exercise a power which he or she does not have, as distinct
from threatening to misuse actual power. Compare Restatement $ 6
with $ 8. Because supervisory harassment cases involve misuse of
actual power, not the false impression of its existence, apparent authority analysis is inappropriate. When a party seeks to impose vicarious liability based on an agent's misuse of delegated authority, the Restatement's aided in the agency relation rule provides the appropriate
analysis. Pp. 759-760.

(f) That rule requires the existence of something more than the employment relation itself because, in a sense, most workplace tortfeasors,
whether supervisors or co-workers, are aided in accomplishing their tortious objective by the employment relation: Proximity and regular contact afford a captive pool of potential victims. Such an additional aid
exists when a supervisor subjects a subordinate to a significant, tangible
employment action, i. e., a significant change in employment status, such
as discharge, demotion, or undesirable reassignment. Every Federal
Court of Appeals to have considered the question has correctly found
vicarious liability in that circumstance. This Court imports the significant, tangible employment action concept for resolution of the vicarious

Syllabus
liability issue considered here. An employer is therefore subject to vicarious liability for such actions. However, where, as here, there is no
tangible employment action, it is not obvious the agency relationship
aids in commission of the tort. Moreover, Meritor holds that agency
principles constrain the imposition of employer liability for supervisor
harassment. Limiting employer liability is also consistent with Title
VII's purpose to the extent it would encourage the creation and use of
antiharassment policies and grievance procedures. Thus, in order to
accommodate the agency principle of vicarious liability for harm caused
by misuse of supervisory authority, as well as Title VII's equally basic
policies of encouraging forethought by employers and saving action by
objecting employees, the Court adopts, in this case and in Faragher v.
Boca Raton, post, p. 775, the following holding: An employer is subject
to vicarious liability to a victimized employee for an actionable hostile
environment created by a supervisor with immediate (or successively
higher) authority over the employee. When no tangible employment
action is taken, a defending employer may raise an affirmative defense
to liability or damages, subject to proof by a preponderance of the evidence, see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(c). The defense comprises two necessary elements: (a) that the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior, and (b) that
the plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid
harm otherwise. While proof that an employer had promulgated an
antiharassment policy with complaint procedure is not necessary in
every instance as a matter of law, the need for a stated policy suitable
to the employment circumstances may appropriately be addressed in
any case when litigating the first element of the defense. And while
proof that an employee failed to fulfill the corresponding obligation of
reasonable care to avoid harm is not limited to showing an unreasonable
failure to use any complaint procedure provided by the employer, a demonstration of such failure will normally suffice to satisfy the employer's
burden under the second element of the defense. No affirmative defense is available, however, when the supervisor's harassment culminates in a tangible employment action. Pp. 760-765.

(g) Given the Court's explanation that the labels quid pro quo and
hostile work environment are not controlling for employer-liability purposes, Ellerth should have an adequate opportunity on remand to prove
she has a claim which would result in vicarious liability. Although she
has not alleged she suffered a tangible employment action at Slowik's
hands, which would deprive Burlington of the affirmative defense, this
is not dispositive. In light of the Court's decision, Burlington is still

tangible job consequences, can recover against the employerwithout showing the employer is negligent or otherwise at
fault for the supervisor's actions.

I
Summary judgment was granted for the employer, so wemust take the facts alleged by the employee to be true.

United States v. Diebold, Inc., 369 U. S. 654, 655 (1962) (percuriam). The employer is Burlington Industries, the petitioner. The employee is Kimberly Ellerth, the respondent.From March 1993 until May 1994, Ellerth worked as a salesperson in one of Burlington's divisions in Chicago, Illinois.During her employment, she alleges, she was subjected
to constant sexual harassment by her supervisor, one TedSlowik.

In the hierarchy of Burlington's management structure,Slowik was a midlevel manager. Burlington has eight divisions, employing more than 22,000 people in some 50 plantsaround the United States. Slowik was a vice president in
one of five business units within one of the divisions. Hehad authority to make hiring and promotion decisions
subject to the approval of his supervisor, who signed the pa-perwork. See 912 F. Supp. 1101, 1119, n. 14 (ND Ill. 1996).
According to Slowik's supervisor, his position was "notconsidered an upper-level management position," and he was
"not amongst the decision-making or policy-making hierar-chy." Ibid. Slowik was not Ellerth's immediate supervisor. Ellerth worked in a two-person office in Chicago, andshe answered to her office colleague, who in turn answered
to Slowik in New York.Against a background of repeated boorish and offensive
remarks and gestures which Slowik allegedly made, Ellerthplaces particular emphasis on three alleged incidents where
Slowik's comments could be construed as threats to deny her

Opinion of the Court
tangible job benefits. In the summer of 1993, while on abusiness trip, Slowik invited Ellerth to the hotel lounge, an

invitation Ellerth felt compelled to accept because Slowikwas her boss. App. 155. When Ellerth gave no encouragement to remarks Slowik made about her breasts, he told her
to "loosen up" and warned, "you know, Kim, I could makeyour life very hard or very easy at Burlington."

Id., at 156.
In March 1994, when Ellerth was being considered for apromotion, Slowik expressed reservations during the promotion interview because she was not "loose enough." Id., at159. The comment was followed by his reaching over and
rubbing her knee. Ibid. Ellerth did receive the promotion;
but when Slowik called to announce it, he told Ellerth,
"you're gonna be out there with men who work in factories,
and they certainly like women with pretty butts/legs." Id.,
at 159-160.

In May 1994, Ellerth called Slowik, asking permission to
insert a customer's logo into a fabric sample. Slowik responded, "I don't have time for you right now, Kim . . .--
unless you want to tell me what you're wearing." Id., at 78.
Ellerth told Slowik she had to go and ended the call. Ibid.
A day or two later, Ellerth called Slowik to ask permission
again. This time he denied her request, but added something along the lines of, "are you wearing shorter skirts yet,
Kim, because it would make your job a whole heck of a lot
easier." Id., at 79.

A short time later, Ellerth's immediate supervisor cautioned her about returning telephone calls to customers in a
prompt fashion. 912 F. Supp., at 1109. In response, Ellerth
quit. She faxed a letter giving reasons unrelated to the alleged sexual harassment we have described. Ibid. About
three weeks later, however, she sent a letter explaining she
quit because of Slowik's behavior. Ibid.

During her tenure at Burlington, Ellerth did not inform
anyone in authority about Slowik's conduct, despite knowing
Burlington had a policy against sexual harassment. Ibid.

Opinion of the Court
In fact, she chose not to inform her immediate supervisor(not Slowik) because " `it would be his duty as my supervisor

to report any incidents of sexual harassment.' " Ibid. Onone occasion, she told Slowik a comment he made was inappropriate. Ibid.

In October 1994, after receiving a right-to-sue letter fromthe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC),

Ellerth filed suit in the United States District Court for theNorthern District of Illinois, alleging Burlington engaged in
sexual harassment and forced her constructive discharge, inviolation of Title VII. The District Court granted summary
judgment to Burlington. The court found Slowik's behavior, as described by Ellerth, severe and pervasive enough
to create a hostile work environment, but found Burlington
neither knew nor should have known about the conduct.
There was no triable issue of fact on the latter point, and
the court noted Ellerth had not used Burlington's internal
complaint procedures. Id., at 1118. Although Ellerth's
claim was framed as a hostile work environment complaint,
the District Court observed there was a quid pro quo "component" to the hostile environment. Id., at 1121. Proceeding from the premise that an employer faces vicarious liability for quid pro quo harassment, the District Court thought
it necessary to apply a negligence standard because the quid
pro quo merely contributed to the hostile work environment.
See id., at 1123. The District Court also dismissed Ellerth's
constructive discharge claim.

The Court of Appeals en banc reversed in a decision which
produced eight separate opinions and no consensus for a
controlling rationale. The judges were able to agree on
the problem they confronted: Vicarious liability, not failure
to comply with a duty of care, was the essence of Ellerth's
case against Burlington on appeal. The judges seemed to
agree Ellerth could recover if Slowik's unfulfilled threats
to deny her tangible job benefits was sufficient to impose
vicarious liability on Burlington. Jansen v. Packing Corp.

750 BURLINGTON INDUSTRIES, INC. v. ELLERTH

Opinion of the Court
of America, 123 F. 3d 490, 494 (CA7 1997) (per curiam).With the exception of Judges Coffey and Easterbrook, the

judges also agreed Ellerth's claim could be categorized asone of

quid pro quo harassment, even though she had
received the promotion and had suffered no other tangible
retaliation. Ibid.The consensus disintegrated on the standard for an employer's liability for such a claim. Six judges, Judges Flaum,Cummings, Bauer, Evans, Rovner, and Diane P. Wood,
agreed the proper standard was vicarious liability, and soEllerth could recover even though Burlington was not negligent. Ibid. They had different reasons for the conclusion.
According to Judges Flaum, Cummings, Bauer, and Evans,
whether a claim involves a quid pro quo determines whether
vicarious liability applies; and they in turn defined quid pro
quo to include a supervisor's threat to inflict a tangible job
injury whether or not it was completed. Id., at 499.
Judges Wood and Rovner interpreted agency principles to
impose vicarious liability on employers for most claims of
supervisor sexual harassment, even absent a quid pro quo.
Id., at 565.

Although Judge Easterbrook did not think Ellerth had
stated a quid pro quo claim, he would have followed the law
of the controlling State to determine the employer's liability,
and by this standard, the employer would be liable here.
Id., at 552. In contrast, Judge Kanne said Ellerth had
stated a quid pro quo claim, but negligence was the appropriate standard of liability when the quid pro quo involved
threats only. Id., at 505.

Chief Judge Posner, joined by Judge Manion, disagreed.
He asserted Ellerth could not recover against Burlington despite having stated a quid pro quo claim. According to
Chief Judge Posner, an employer is subject to vicarious liability for "act[s] that significantly alte[r] the terms or conditions of employment," or "company act[s]." Id., at 515. In
the emergent terminology, an unfulfilled quid pro quo is a

Opinion of the Court
mere threat to do a company act rather than the act itself,and in these circumstances, an employer can be found liable

for its negligence only. Ibid. Chief Judge Posner alsofound Ellerth failed to create a triable issue of fact as to
Burlington's negligence. Id., at 517.Judge Coffey rejected all of the above approaches because
he favored a uniform standard of negligence in almost allsexual harassment cases.

Id., at 518.The disagreement revealed in the careful opinions of the

judges of the Court of Appeals reflects the fact that Con-gress has left it to the courts to determine controlling agency
law principles in a new and difficult area of federal law. Wegranted certiorari to assist in defining the relevant standards
of employer liability. 522 U. S. 1086 (1998).

II
At the outset, we assume an important proposition yet tobe established before a trier of fact. It is a premise assumed

as well, in explicit or implicit terms, in the various opinionsby the judges of the Court of Appeals. The premise is: A
trier of fact could find in Slowik's remarks numerous threatsto retaliate against Ellerth if she denied some sexual liberties. The threats, however, were not carried out or fulfilled.Cases based on threats which are carried out are referred
to often as quid pro quo cases, as distinct from bothersomeattentions or sexual remarks that are sufficiently severe or
pervasive to create a hostile work environment. The terms
quid pro quo and hostile work environment are helpful, per-haps, in making a rough demarcation between cases in which

threats are carried out and those where they are not or areabsent altogether, but beyond this are of limited utility.

Section 703(a) of Title VII forbids

"an employer--
"(1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individ-ual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual

with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or

Opinion of the Court
privileges of employment, because of such individual's. . . sex." 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-2(a)(1).

"Quid pro quo" and "hostile work environment" do not ap-pear in the statutory text. The terms appeared first in the
academic literature, see C. MacKinnon, Sexual Harassmentof Working Women (1979); found their way into decisions of
the Courts of Appeals, see, e. g., Henson v. Dundee, 682 F. 2d897, 909 (CA11 1982); and were mentioned in this Court's
decision in Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477 U. S.57 (1986). See generally E. Scalia, The Strange Career of
Quid Pro Quo Sexual Harassment, 21 Harv. J. L. & Pub.Policy 307 (1998).

In Meritor, the terms served a specific and limited pur-pose. There we considered whether the conduct in question
constituted discrimination in the terms or conditions of em-ployment in violation of Title VII. We assumed, and with
adequate reason, that if an employer demanded sexual favorsfrom an employee in return for a job benefit, discrimination
with respect to terms or conditions of employment was ex-plicit. Less obvious was whether an employer's sexually demeaning behavior altered terms or conditions of employmentin violation of Title VII. We distinguished between quid
pro quo claims and hostile environment claims, see 477 U. S.,at 65, and said both were cognizable under Title VII, though
the latter requires harassment that is severe or pervasive.
Ibid. The principal significance of the distinction is to in-struct that Title VII is violated by either explicit or constructive alterations in the terms or conditions of employ-ment and to explain the latter must be severe or pervasive.
The distinction was not discussed for its bearing upon anemployer's liability for an employee's discrimination. On
this question Meritor held, with no further specifics, thatagency principles controlled.

Id., at 72.Nevertheless, as use of the terms grew in the wake of

Meritor, they acquired their own significance. The standardof employer responsibility turned on which type of harass524US2 Unit: $U99 [09-15-00 14:41:05] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
ment occurred. If the plaintiff established a quid pro quoclaim, the Courts of Appeals held, the employer was subject

to vicarious liability. See Davis v. Sioux City, 115 F. 3d1365, 1367 (CA8 1997);

Nichols v. Frank, 42 F. 3d 503, 513-
514 (CA9 1994); Bouton v. BMW of North America, Inc., 29
F. 3d 103, 106-107 (CA3 1994); Sauers v. Salt Lake County,1 F. 3d 1122, 1127 (CA10 1993);

Kauffman v. Allied Signal,
Inc., 970 F. 2d 178, 185-186 (CA6), cert. denied, 506 U. S.1041 (1992);

Steele v. Offshore Shipbuilding, Inc., 867 F. 2d
1311, 1316 (CA11 1989). The rule encouraged Title VIIplaintiffs to state their claims as

quid pro quo claims, which
in turn put expansive pressure on the definition. The equiv-alence of the

quid pro quo label and vicarious liability is illustrated by this case. The question presented on certiorari is
whether Ellerth can state a claim of quid pro quo harass-ment, but the issue of real concern to the parties is whether

Burlington has vicarious liability for Slowik's alleged mis-conduct, rather than liability limited to its own negligence.
The question presented for certiorari asks:

"Whether a claim of quid pro quo sexual harassment
may be stated under Title VII . . . where the plaintiffemployee has neither submitted to the sexual advances

of the alleged harasser nor suffered any tangible effectson the compensation, terms, conditions or privileges of
employment as a consequence of a refusal to submit tothose advances?" Pet. for Cert. i.

We do not suggest the terms quid pro quo and hostilework environment are irrelevant to Title VII litigation. To
the extent they illustrate the distinction between cases involving a threat which is carried out and offensive conduct
in general, the terms are relevant when there is a threshold
question whether a plaintiff can prove discrimination in violation of Title VII. When a plaintiff proves that a tangible
employment action resulted from a refusal to submit to a

Opinion of the Court
employment decision itself constitutes a change in the termsand conditions of employment that is actionable under Title

VII. For any sexual harassment preceding the employmentdecision to be actionable, however, the conduct must be severe or pervasive. Because Ellerth's claim involves only un-fulfilled threats, it should be categorized as a hostile work
environment claim which requires a showing of severe orpervasive conduct. See

Oncale v. Sundowner OffshoreServices, Inc., 523 U. S. 75, 81 (1998); Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc., 510 U. S. 17, 21 (1993). For purposes of this case,we accept the District Court's finding that the alleged conduct was severe or pervasive. See supra, at 749. The casebefore us involves numerous alleged threats, and we express
no opinion as to whether a single unfulfilled threat is suffi-cient to constitute discrimination in the terms or conditions
of employment.When we assume discrimination can be proved, however,
the factors we discuss below, and not the categories quid pro
quo and hostile work environment, will be controlling on theissue of vicarious liability. That is the question we must

resolve. III

We must decide, then, whether an employer has vicariousliability when a supervisor creates a hostile work environment by making explicit threats to alter a subordinate'sterms or conditions of employment, based on sex, but does
not fulfill the threat. We turn to principles of agency law,
for the term "employer" is defined under Title VII to include"agents." 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e(b); see

Meritor, supra, at 72.
In express terms, Congress has directed federal courts to
interpret Title VII based on agency principles. Given suchan explicit instruction, we conclude a uniform and predictable standard must be established as a matter of federal law.We rely "on the general common law of agency, rather than
on the law of any particular State, to give meaning to these

terms." Community for Creative Non-Violence v. Reid,490 U. S. 730, 740 (1989). The resulting federal rule, based

on a body of case law developed over time, is statutory inter-pretation pursuant to congressional direction. This is not
federal common law in "the strictest sense, i. e., a rule ofdecision that amounts, not simply to an interpretation of a
federal statute . . . , but, rather, to the judicial `creation' of aspecial federal rule of decision."

Atherton v. FDIC, 519U. S. 213, 218 (1997). State-court decisions, applying state

employment discrimination law, may be instructive in apply-ing general agency principles, but, it is interesting to note,
in many cases their determinations of employer liabilityunder state law rely in large part on federal-court decisions
under Title VII. E. g., Arizona v. Schallock, 189 Ariz. 250,259, 941 P. 2d 1275, 1284 (1997);

Lehmann v. Toys `R' Us,Inc., 132 N. J. 587, 622, 626 A. 2d 445, 463 (1993); Thompson

v. Berta Enterprises, Inc., 72 Wash. App. 531, 537-539, 864P. 2d 983, 986-988 (1994).

As Meritor acknowledged, the Restatement (Second) ofAgency (1957) (hereinafter Restatement) is a useful beginning point for a discussion of general agency principles. 477U. S., at 72. Since our decision in

Meritor, federal courtshave explored agency principles, and we find useful instruction in their decisions, noting that "common-law principlesmay not be transferable in all their particulars to Title VII."
Ibid. The EEOC has issued Guidelines governing sexual
harassment claims under Title VII, but they provide littleguidance on the issue of employer liability for supervisor

harassment. See 29 CFR $ 1604.11(c) (1997) (vicarious liabil-ity for supervisor harassment turns on "the particular employment relationship and the job functions performed bythe individual").

A
Section 219(1) of the Restatement sets out a central principle of agency law:

524US2 Unit: $U99 [09-15-00 14:41:05] PAGES PGT: OPIN
756 BURLINGTON INDUSTRIES, INC. v. ELLERTH

Opinion of the Court
"A master is subject to liability for the torts of hisservants committed while acting in the scope of their

employment."
An employer may be liable for both negligent and inten-tional torts committed by an employee within the scope of

his or her employment. Sexual harassment under Title VIIpresupposes intentional conduct. While early decisions absolved employers of liability for the intentional torts of theiremployees, the law now imposes liability where the employee's "purpose, however misguided, is wholly or in part tofurther the master's business." W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R.
Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts$ 70, p. 505 (5th ed. 1984) (hereinafter Prosser and Keeton
on Torts). In applying scope of employment principles tointentional torts, however, it is accepted that "it is less likely
that a willful tort will properly be held to be in the courseof employment and that the liability of the master for such
torts will naturally be more limited." F. Mechem, Outlinesof the Law of Agency $ 394, p. 266 (P. Mechem 4th ed. 1952).
The Restatement defines conduct, including an intentionaltort, to be within the scope of employment when "actuated,
at least in part, by a purpose to serve the [employer]," evenif it is forbidden by the employer. Restatement $$ 228(1)(c),
230. For example, when a salesperson lies to a customerto make a sale, the tortious conduct is within the scope of
employment because it benefits the employer by increasingsales, even though it may violate the employer's policies.
See Prosser and Keeton on Torts $ 70, at 505-506.As Courts of Appeals have recognized, a supervisor acting
out of gender-based animus or a desire to fulfill sexual urgesmay not be actuated by a purpose to serve the employer.
See, e. g., Harrison v. Eddy Potash, Inc., 112 F. 3d 1437, 1444(CA10 1997), vacated on other grounds,

post, p. 947; Torresv. Pisano, 116 F. 3d 625, 634, n. 10 (CA2 1997). But see

Opinion of the Court
but employer was not liable because of its quick and effectiveremediation). The harassing supervisor often acts for personal motives, motives unrelated and even antithetical tothe objectives of the employer. Cf. Mechem,

supra, $ 368
("[F]or the time being [the supervisor] is conspicuously and
unmistakably seeking a personal end"); see also Restatement$ 235, Illustration 2 (tort committed while "[a]cting purely

from personal ill will" not within the scope of employment);
id., Illustration 3 (tort committed in retaliation for failing to
pay the employee a bribe not within the scope of employ-ment). There are instances, of course, where a supervisor

engages in unlawful discrimination with the purpose, mistaken or otherwise, to serve the employer. E. g., Sims v.
Montgomery County Comm'n, 766 F. Supp. 1052, 1075 (MD
Ala. 1990) (supervisor acting in scope of employment where
employer has a policy of discouraging women from seeking
advancement and "sexual harassment was simply a way of
furthering that policy").

The concept of scope of employment has not always been
construed to require a motive to serve the employer. E. g.,
Ira S. Bushey & Sons, Inc. v. United States, 398 F. 2d 167,
172 (CA2 1968). Federal courts have nonetheless found similar limitations on employer liability when applying the
agency laws of the States under the Federal Tort Claims
Act, which makes the Federal Government liable for torts
committed by employees within the scope of employment.
28 U. S. C. $ 1346(b); see, e. g., Jamison v. Wiley, 14 F. 3d 222,
237 (CA4 1994) (supervisor's unfair criticism of subordinate's
work in retaliation for rejecting his sexual advances not
within scope of employment); Wood v. United States, 995
F. 2d 1122, 1123 (CA1 1993) (Breyer, C. J.) (sexual harassment amounting to assault and battery "clearly outside the
scope of employment"); see also 2 L. Jayson & R. Longstreth,
Handling Federal Tort Claims $ 9.07[4], p. 9-211 (1998).

The general rule is that sexual harassment by a supervisor
is not conduct within the scope of employment.

758 BURLINGTON INDUSTRIES, INC. v. ELLERTH

Opinion of the Court

B
Scope of employment does not define the only basis foremployer liability under agency principles. In limited circumstances, agency principles impose liability on employerseven where employees commit torts outside the scope of employment. The principles are set forth in the much-cited$ 219(2) of the Restatement:

"(2) A master is not subject to liability for the torts ofhis servants acting outside the scope of their employment, unless:"(a) the master intended the conduct or the consequences, or"(b) the master was negligent or reckless, or

"(c) the conduct violated a non-delegable duty of themaster, or
"(d) the servant purported to act or to speak on behalfof the principal and there was reliance upon apparent
authority, or he was aided in accomplishing the tort bythe existence of the agency relation."

See also $ 219, Comment e (Section 219(2) "enumerates thesituations in which a master may be liable for torts of servants acting solely for their own purposes and hence not inthe scope of employment").

Subsection (a) addresses direct liability, where the em-ployer acts with tortious intent, and indirect liability, where
the agent's high rank in the company makes him or her theemployer's alter ego. None of the parties contend Slowik's
rank imputes liability under this principle. There is no con-tention, furthermore, that a nondelegable duty is involved.
See $ 219(2)(c). So, for our purposes here, subsections (a)and (c) can be put aside.

Subsections (b) and (d) are possible grounds for imposingemployer liability on account of a supervisor's acts and must
be considered. Under subsection (b), an employer is liablewhen the tort is attributable to the employer's own negli524US2 Unit: $U99 [09-15-00 14:41:05] PAGES PGT: OPIN

759Cite as: 524 U. S. 742 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
gence. $ 219(2)(b). Thus, although a supervisor's sexualharassment is outside the scope of employment because the

conduct was for personal motives, an employer can be liable,nonetheless, where its own negligence is a cause of the harassment. An employer is negligent with respect to sexualharassment if it knew or should have known about the conduct and failed to stop it. Negligence sets a minimumstandard for employer liability under Title VII; but Ellerth
seeks to invoke the more stringent standard of vicariousliability.

Section 219(2)(d) concerns vicarious liability for intentionaltorts committed by an employee when the employee uses
apparent authority (the apparent authority standard), orwhen the employee "was aided in accomplishing the tort
by the existence of the agency relation" (the aided in theagency relation standard). Ibid. As other federal decisions have done in discussing vicarious liability for supervi-sor harassment, e. g., Henson v. Dundee, 682 F. 2d 897, 909
(CA11 1982), we begin with $ 219(2)(d).

C
As a general rule, apparent authority is relevant wherethe agent purports to exercise a power which he or she does

not have, as distinct from where the agent threatens tomisuse actual power. Compare Restatement $ 6 (defining
"power") with $ 8 (defining "apparent authority"). In theusual case, a supervisor's harassment involves misuse of actual power, not the false impression of its existence. Appar-ent authority analysis therefore is inappropriate in this context. If, in the unusual case, it is alleged there is a falseimpression that the actor was a supervisor, when he in fact
was not, the victim's mistaken conclusion must be a reason-able one. Restatement $ 8, Comment

c ("Apparent author-ity exists only to the extent it is reasonable for the third

person dealing with the agent to believe that the agent isauthorized"). When a party seeks to impose vicarious liabil524US2 Unit: $U99 [09-15-00 14:41:05] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
ity based on an agent's misuse of delegated authority, theRestatement's aided in the agency relation rule, rather than

the apparent authority rule, appears to be the appropriateform of analysis.

D
We turn to the aided in the agency relation standard. In asense, most workplace tortfeasors are aided in accomplishing

their tortious objective by the existence of the agency rela-tion: Proximity and regular contact may afford a captive pool
of potential victims. See Gary v. Long, 59 F. 3d 1391, 1397(CADC 1995). Were this to satisfy the aided in the agency
relation standard, an employer would be subject to vicariousliability not only for all supervisor harassment, but also for
all co-worker harassment, a result enforced by neither theEEOC nor any court of appeals to have considered the issue.
See, e. g., Blankenship v. Parke Care Centers, Inc., 123 F. 3d868, 872 (CA6 1997), cert. denied, 522 U. S. 1110 (1998) (sex
discrimination); McKenzie v. Illinois Dept. of Transp., 92F. 3d 473, 480 (CA7 1996) (sex discrimination);

Daniels v.Essex Group, Inc., 937 F. 2d 1264, 1273 (CA7 1991) (race discrimination); see also 29 CFR $ 1604.11(d) (1997) ("knows orshould have known" standard of liability for cases of harassment between "fellow employees"). The aided in the agencyrelation standard, therefore, requires the existence of something more than the employment relation itself.At the outset, we can identify a class of cases where, beyond question, more than the mere existence of the employ-ment relation aids in commission of the harassment: when a
supervisor takes a tangible employment action against thesubordinate. Every Federal Court of Appeals to have considered the question has found vicarious liability when adiscriminatory act results in a tangible employment action.
See, e. g., Sauers v. Salt Lake County, 1 F. 3d 1122, 1127(CA10 1993) (" `If the plaintiff can show that she suffered an
economic injury from her supervisor's actions, the employerbecomes strictly liable without any further showing . . .' ").

761Cite as: 524 U. S. 742 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
In Meritor, we acknowledged this consensus. See 477 U. S.,at 70-71 ("[T]he courts have consistently held employers

liable for the discriminatory discharges of employees by su-pervisory personnel, whether or not the employer knew, or
should have known, or approved of the supervisor's actions").
Although few courts have elaborated how agency principlessupport this rule, we think it reflects a correct application of

the aided in the agency relation standard.In the context of this case, a tangible employment action
would have taken the form of a denial of a raise or a promo-tion. The concept of a tangible employment action appears
in numerous cases in the Courts of Appeals discussing claims
involving race, age, and national origin discrimination, as
well as sex discrimination. Without endorsing the specific
results of those decisions, we think it prudent to import the
concept of a tangible employment action for resolution of the
vicarious liability issue we consider here. A tangible employment action constitutes a significant change in employment status, such as hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a
decision causing a significant change in benefits. Compare
Crady v. Liberty Nat. Bank & Trust Co. of Ind., 993 F. 2d
132, 136 (CA7 1993) ("A materially adverse change might be
indicated by a termination of employment, a demotion evidenced by a decrease in wage or salary, a less distinguished
title, a material loss of benefits, significantly diminished material responsibilities, or other indices that might be unique
to a particular situation"), with Flaherty v. Gas Research
Institute, 31 F. 3d 451, 456 (CA7 1994) (a "bruised ego" is not
enough), Kocsis v. Multi-Care Management, Inc., 97 F. 3d
876, 887 (CA6 1996) (demotion without change in pay, benefits, duties, or prestige insufficient), and Harlston v. McDonnell Douglas Corp., 37 F. 3d 379, 382 (CA8 1994) (reassignment to more inconvenient job insufficient).

When a supervisor makes a tangible employment decision,
there is assurance the injury could not have been inflicted

524US2 Unit: $U99 [09-15-00 14:41:05] PAGES PGT: OPIN
762 BURLINGTON INDUSTRIES, INC. v. ELLERTH

Opinion of the Court
absent the agency relation. A tangible employment actionin most cases inflicts direct economic harm. As a general

proposition, only a supervisor, or other person acting withthe authority of the company, can cause this sort of injury.
A co-worker can break a co-worker's arm as easily as a
supervisor, and anyone who has regular contact with anemployee can inflict psychological injuries by his or her

offensive conduct. See Gary, supra, at 1397; Henson, 682F. 2d, at 910;

Barnes v. Costle, 561 F. 2d 983, 996 (CADC
1977) (MacKinnon, J., concurring). But one co-worker (ab-sent some elaborate scheme) cannot dock another's pay, nor

can one co-worker demote another. Tangible employment
actions fall within the special province of the supervisor.
The supervisor has been empowered by the company as a
distinct class of agent to make economic decisions affecting
other employees under his or her control.

Tangible employment actions are the means by which the
supervisor brings the official power of the enterprise to bear
on subordinates. A tangible employment decision requires
an official act of the enterprise, a company act. The decision
in most cases is documented in official company records, and
may be subject to review by higher level supervisors. E. g.,
Shager v. Upjohn Co., 913 F. 2d 398, 405 (CA7 1990) (noting
that the supervisor did not fire plaintiff; rather, the Career
Path Committee did, but the employer was still liable because the committee functioned as the supervisor's "cat'spaw"). The supervisor often must obtain the imprimatur of
the enterprise and use its internal processes. See Kotcher
v. Rosa & Sullivan Appliance Center, Inc., 957 F. 2d 59,
62 (CA2 1992) ("From the perspective of the employee, the
supervisor and the employer merge into a single entity").

For these reasons, a tangible employment action taken by
the supervisor becomes for Title VII purposes the act of the
employer. Whatever the exact contours of the aided in the
agency relation standard, its requirements will always be
met when a supervisor takes a tangible employment action

524US2 Unit: $U99 [09-15-00 14:41:05] PAGES PGT: OPIN

763Cite as: 524 U. S. 742 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
against a subordinate. In that instance, it would be implau-sible to interpret agency principles to allow an employer to

escape liability, as Meritor itself appeared to acknowledge.See

supra, at 760-761.
Whether the agency relation aids in commission of supervisor harassment which does not culminate in a tangible em-ployment action is less obvious. Application of the standard

is made difficult by its malleable terminology, which can beread to either expand or limit liability in the context of
supervisor harassment. On the one hand, a supervisor'spower and authority invests his or her harassing conduct
with a particular threatening character, and in this sense,
a supervisor always is aided by the agency relation. See
Meritor, 477 U. S., at 77 (Marshall, J., concurring in judgment) ("[I]t is precisely because the supervisor is understood
to be clothed with the employer's authority that he is able
to impose unwelcome sexual conduct on subordinates"). On
the other hand, there are acts of harassment a supervisor
might commit which might be the same acts a coemployee
would commit, and there may be some circumstances where
the supervisor's status makes little difference.

It is this tension which, we think, has caused so much confusion among the Courts of Appeals which have sought to
apply the aided in the agency relation standard to Title VII
cases. The aided in the agency relation standard, however,
is a developing feature of agency law, and we hesitate to
render a definitive explanation of our understanding of the
standard in an area where other important considerations
must affect our judgment. In particular, we are bound by
our holding in Meritor that agency principles constrain the
imposition of vicarious liability in cases of supervisory harassment. See id., at 72 ("Congress' decision to define `employer' to include any `agent' of an employer, 42 U. S. C.

$ 2000e(b), surely evinces an intent to place some limits on
the acts of employees for which employers under Title VII
are to be held responsible"). Congress has not altered Mer524US2 Unit: $U99 [09-15-00 14:41:05] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
itor's rule even though it has made significant amendmentsto Title VII in the interim. See

Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U. S. 720, 736 (1977) ("[W]e must bear in mind thatconsiderations of

stare decisis weigh heavily in the area of
statutory construction, where Congress is free to change this
Court's interpretation of its legislation").Although

Meritor suggested the limitation on employer
liability stemmed from agency principles, the Court acknowl-edged other considerations might be relevant as well. See

477 U. S., at 72 ("common-law principles may not be transfer-able in all their particulars to Title VII"). For example,
Title VII is designed to encourage the creation of antiharassment policies and effective grievance mechanisms. Were
employer liability to depend in part on an employer's effort
to create such procedures, it would effect Congress' intention
to promote conciliation rather than litigation in the Title VII
context, see EEOC v. Shell Oil Co., 466 U. S. 54, 77 (1984),
and the EEOC's policy of encouraging the development
of grievance procedures. See 29 CFR $ 1604.11(f) (1997);
EEOC Policy Guidance on Sexual Harassment, 8 BNA FEP
Manual 405:6699 (Mar. 19, 1990). To the extent limiting employer liability could encourage employees to report harassing conduct before it becomes severe or pervasive, it would
also serve Title VII's deterrent purpose. See McKennon v.
Nashville Banner Publishing Co., 513 U. S. 352, 358 (1995).
As we have observed, Title VII borrows from tort law the
avoidable consequences doctrine, see Ford Motor Co. v.
EEOC, 458 U. S. 219, 231, n. 15 (1982), and the considerations
which animate that doctrine would also support the limitation of employer liability in certain circumstances.

In order to accommodate the agency principles of vicarious
liability for harm caused by misuse of supervisory authority,
as well as Title VII's equally basic policies of encouraging
forethought by employers and saving action by objecting employees, we adopt the following holding in this case and in
Faragher v. Boca Raton, post, p. 775, also decided today.

Opinion of the Court
An employer is subject to vicarious liability to a victimizedemployee for an actionable hostile environment created by a

supervisor with immediate (or successively higher) authorityover the employee. When no tangible employment action is
taken, a defending employer may raise an affirmative de-fense to liability or damages, subject to proof by a preponderance of the evidence, see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(c). Thedefense comprises two necessary elements: (a) that the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correctpromptly any sexually harassing behavior, and (b) that the
plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage ofany preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the
employer or to avoid harm otherwise. While proof that anemployer had promulgated an antiharassment policy with
complaint procedure is not necessary in every instance as amatter of law, the need for a stated policy suitable to the
employment circumstances may appropriately be addressedin any case when litigating the first element of the defense.
And while proof that an employee failed to fulfill the cor-responding obligation of reasonable care to avoid harm is
not limited to showing an unreasonable failure to use anycomplaint procedure provided by the employer, a demonstration of such failure will normally suffice to satisfy theemployer's burden under the second element of the defense. No affirmative defense is available, however, whenthe supervisor's harassment culminates in a tangible employment action, such as discharge, demotion, or undesirablereassignment.

IV
Relying on existing case law which held out the promiseof vicarious liability for all

quid pro quo claims, see supra,at 752-753, Ellerth focused all her attention in the Court

of Appeals on proving her claim fit within that category.Given our explanation that the labels quid pro quo and hostile work environment are not controlling for purposes ofestablishing employer liability, see supra, at 754, Ellerth

Thomas, J., dissenting
should have an adequate opportunity to prove she has aclaim for which Burlington is liable.

Although Ellerth has not alleged she suffered a tangibleemployment action at the hands of Slowik, which would
deprive Burlington of the availability of the affirmativedefense, this is not dispositive. In light of our decision,
Burlington is still subject to vicarious liability for Slowik'sactivity, but Burlington should have an opportunity to assert
and prove the affirmative defense to liability. See supra,at 765.

For these reasons, we will affirm the judgment of theCourt of Appeals, reversing the grant of summary judgment
against Ellerth. On remand, the District Court will havethe opportunity to decide whether it would be appropriate
to allow Ellerth to amend her pleading or supplement herdiscovery.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.

It is so ordered.
Justice Ginsburg, concurring in the judgment.
I agree with the Court's ruling that "the labels quid proquo and hostile work environment are not controlling for

purposes of establishing employer liability." Ante, at 765.I also subscribe to the Court's statement of the rule governing employer liability, ibid., which is substantively identicalto the rule the Court adopts in

Faragher v. Boca Raton, post,p. 775.

Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Scalia joins,dissenting.
The Court today manufactures a rule that employers arevicariously liable if supervisors create a sexually hostile
work environment, subject to an affirmative defense that theCourt barely attempts to define. This rule applies even if
the employer has a policy against sexual harassment, theemployee knows about that policy, and the employee never

Thomas, J., dissenting
informs anyone in a position of authority about the super-visor's conduct. As a result, employer liability under Title

VII is judged by different standards depending uponwhether a sexually or racially hostile work environment is
alleged. The standard of employer liability should be thesame in both instances: An employer should be liable if, and
only if, the plaintiff proves that the employer was negligentin permitting the supervisor's conduct to occur.

I
Years before sexual harassment was recognized as "dis-criminat[ion] . . . because of . . . sex," 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-

2(a)(1), the Courts of Appeals considered whether, and when,a racially hostile work environment could violate Title VII.

1

In the landmark case Rogers v. EEOC, 454 F. 2d 234 (1971),cert. denied, 406 U. S. 957 (1972), the Court of Appeals for

the Fifth Circuit held that the practice of racially segregat-ing patients in a doctor's office could amount to discrimination in " `the terms, conditions, or privileges' " of employ-ment, thereby violating Title VII. 454 F. 2d, at 238 (quoting
42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-2(a)(1)). The principal opinion in thecase concluded that employment discrimination was not limited to the "isolated and distinguishable events" of "hiring,firing, and promoting." 454 F. 2d, at 238 (opinion of Goldberg, J.). Rather, Title VII could also be violated by a workenvironment "heavily polluted with discrimination," because
of the deleterious effects of such an atmosphere on an em-ployee's well-being.

Ibid.Accordingly, after Rogers, a plaintiff claiming employment

discrimination based upon race could assert a claim for aracially hostile work environment, in addition to the classic

1 This sequence of events is not surprising, given that the primary goal
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was to eradicate race discrimination and

claim of so-called "disparate treatment." A disparate treat-ment claim required a plaintiff to prove an adverse employment consequence and discriminatory intent by his employer.See 1 B. Lindemann & P. Grossman, Employment Discrimination Law 10-11 (3d ed. 1996). A hostile environment
claim required the plaintiff to show that his work environ-ment was so pervaded by racial harassment as to alter the

terms and conditions of his employment. See, e. g., Snell v.
Suffolk Cty., 782 F. 2d 1094, 1103 (CA2 1986) ("To establish
a hostile atmosphere, . . . plaintiffs must prove more than afew isolated incidents of racial enmity");

Johnson v. Bunny
Bread Co., 646 F. 2d 1250, 1257 (CA8 1981) (no violation of
Title VII from infrequent use of racial slurs). This is the
same standard now used when determining whether sexual
harassment renders a work environment hostile. See Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc., 510 U. S. 17, 21 (1993) (actionable sexual harassment occurs when the workplace is
"permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and
insult" (emphasis added; internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).

In race discrimination cases, employer liability has turned
on whether the plaintiff has alleged an adverse employment
consequence, such as firing or demotion, or a hostile work
environment. If a supervisor takes an adverse employment
action because of race, causing the employee a tangible job
detriment, the employer is vicariously liable for resulting
damages. See ante, at 760-761. This is because such actions are company acts that can be performed only by the
exercise of specific authority granted by the employer, and
thus the supervisor acts as the employer. If, on the other
hand, the employee alleges a racially hostile work environment, the employer is liable only for negligence: that is, only
if the employer knew, or in the exercise of reasonable care
should have known, about the harassment and failed to take
remedial action. See, e. g., Dennis v. Cty. of Fairfax, 55 F.
3d 151, 153 (CA4 1995); Davis v. Monsanto Chemical Co.,

858 F. 2d 345, 349 (CA6 1988), cert. denied, 490 U. S. 1110(1989). Liability has thus been imposed only if the employer

is blameworthy in some way. See, e. g., Davis v. MonsantoChemical Co., supra, at 349; Snell v. Suffolk Cty., supra, at
1104; DeGrace v. Rumsfeld, 614 F. 2d 796, 805 (CA1 1980).This distinction applies with equal force in cases of sexual
harassment.2 When a supervisor inflicts an adverse employ-ment consequence upon an employee who has rebuffed his
advances, the supervisor exercises the specific authoritygranted to him by his company. His acts, therefore, are the
company's acts and are properly chargeable to it. See 123F. 3d 490, 514 (CA7 1997) (Posner, C. J., dissenting);

ante,at 762 ("Tangible employment actions fall within the special

province of the supervisor. The supervisor has been em-powered by the company as a distinct class of agent to make
economic decisions affecting other employees under his orher control").

If a supervisor creates a hostile work environment, how-ever, he does not act for the employer. As the Court concedes, a supervisor's creation of a hostile work environmentis neither within the scope of his employment, nor part of

his apparent authority. See ante, at 755-760. Indeed, ahostile work environment is antithetical to the interest of the
employer. In such circumstances, an employer should be li-able only if it has been negligent. That is, liability should
attach only if the employer either knew, or in the exercise of

2 The Courts of Appeals relied on racial harassment cases when analyzing early claims of discrimination based upon a supervisor's sexual harassment. For example, when the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held that a work environment poisoned by a supervisor's
"sexually stereotyped insults and demeaning propositions" could itself violate Title VII, its principal authority was Judge Goldberg's opinion in Rogers v. EEOC, 454 F. 2d 234 (CA5 1971). See Bundy v. Jackson, 641 F. 2d
934, 944 (CADC 1981); see also Henson v. Dundee, 682 F. 2d 897, 901 (CA11
1982). So, too, this Court relied on Rogers when in Meritor Savings
Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477 U. S. 57 (1986), it recognized a cause of action
under Title VII for sexual harassment. See id., at 65-66.

reasonable care should have known, about the hostile workenvironment and failed to take remedial action.

Sexual harassment is simply not something that employerscan wholly prevent without taking extraordinary measures--constant video and audio surveillance, for example--that would revolutionize the workplace in a manner incompatible with a free society. See 123 F. 3d, at 513 (Posner,C. J., dissenting). Indeed, such measures could not even detect incidents of harassment such as the comments Slowikallegedly made to respondent in a hotel bar. The most that
employers can be charged with, therefore, is a duty to actreasonably under the circumstances. As one court recognized in addressing an early racial harassment claim:

"It may not always be within an employer's power toguarantee an environment free from all bigotry. . . . [H]e

can let it be known, however, that racial harassment willnot be tolerated, and he can take all reasonable measures to enforce this policy. . . . But once an employer hasin good faith taken those measures which are both feasible and reasonable under the circumstances to combatthe offensive conduct we do not think he can be charged
with discriminating on the basis of race." DeGrace v.
Rumsfeld, 614 F. 2d 796, 805 (1980).

3 I agree with the Court that the doctrine of quid pro quo sexual harassment is irrelevant to the issue of an employer's vicarious liability. I do
not, however, agree that the distinction between hostile work environment
and quid pro quo sexual harassment is relevant "when there is a threshold
question whether a plaintiff can prove discrimination in violation of Title
VII." Ante, at 753. A supervisor's threat to take adverse action against
an employee who refuses his sexual demands, if never carried out, may
create a hostile work environment, but that is all. Cases involving such
threats, without more, should therefore be analyzed as hostile work environment cases only. If, on the other hand, the supervisor carries out his
threat and causes the plaintiff a job detriment, the plaintiff may have a
disparate treatment claim under Title VII. See E. Scalia, The Strange
Career of Quid Pro Quo Sexual Harassment, 21 Harv. J. L. & Pub. Policy
307, 309-314 (1998).

Under a negligence standard, Burlington cannot be heldliable for Slowik's conduct. Although respondent alleged a

hostile work environment, she never contended that Burling-ton had been negligent in permitting the harassment to
occur, and there is no question that Burlington acted reason-ably under the circumstances. The company had a policy
against sexual harassment, and respondent admitted that shewas aware of the policy but nonetheless failed to tell anyone
with authority over Slowik about his behavior. See ante, at748. Burlington therefore cannot be charged with knowledge of Slowik's alleged harassment or with a failure toexercise reasonable care in not knowing about it.

II
Rejecting a negligence standard, the Court instead im-poses a rule of vicarious employer liability, subject to a

vague affirmative defense, for the acts of supervisors whowield no delegated authority in creating a hostile work environment. This rule is a whole-cloth creation that draws nosupport from the legal principles on which the Court claims
it is based. Compounding its error, the Court fails to ex-plain how employers can rely upon the affirmative defense,
thus ensuring a continuing reign of confusion in this impor-tant area of the law.

In justifying its holding, the Court refers to our commentin

Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477 U. S. 57 (1986),that the lower courts should look to "agency principles" for

guidance in determining the scope of employer liability, id.,at 72. The Court then interprets the term "agency principles" to mean the Restatement (Second) of Agency (1957).The Court finds two portions of the Restatement to be relevant: $ 219(2)(b), which provides that a master is liable forhis servant's torts if the master is reckless or negligent, and

$ 219(2)(d), which states that a master is liable for his serv-ant's torts when the servant is "aided in accomplishing the
tort by the existence of the agency relation." The Court

524US2 Unit: $U99 [09-15-00 14:41:05] PAGES PGT: OPIN
772 BURLINGTON INDUSTRIES, INC. v. ELLERTH

Thomas, J., dissenting
appears to reason that a supervisor is "aided . . . by . . .the agency relation" in creating a hostile work environment

because the supervisor's "power and authority invests his orher harassing conduct with a particular threatening character." Ante, at 763.

Section 219(2)(d) of the Restatement provides no basis
whatsoever for imposing vicarious liability for a supervisor's
creation of a hostile work environment. Contrary to the
Court's suggestions, the principle embodied in $ 219(2)(d) has
nothing to do with a servant's "power and authority," nor
with whether his actions appear "threatening." Rather, as
demonstrated by the Restatement's illustrations, liability
under $ 219(2)(d) depends upon the plaintiff 's belief that the
agent acted in the ordinary course of business or within the
scope of his apparent authority.4 In this day and age, no
sexually harassed employee can reasonably believe that a harassing supervisor is conducting the official business of the
company or acting on its behalf. Indeed, the Court admits
as much in demonstrating why sexual harassment is not committed within the scope of a supervisor's employment and is
not part of his apparent authority. See ante, at 755-760.

Thus although the Court implies that it has found guidance
in both precedent and statute--see ante, at 755 ("The resulting federal rule, based on a body of case law developed over
time, is statutory interpretation pursuant to congressional
direction")--its holding is a product of willful policymaking,
pure and simple. The only agency principle that justifies
imposing employer liability in this context is the principle

4 See Restatement $ 219, Comment e; $ 261, Comment a (principal liable
for an agent's fraud if "the agent's position facilitates the consummation
of the fraud, in that from the point of view of the third person the transaction seems regular on its face and the agent appears to be acting in the
ordinary course of business confided to him"); $ 247, Illustrations (newspaper liable for a defamatory editorial published by editor for his own
purposes).

that a master will be liable for a servant's torts if the masterwas negligent or reckless in permitting them to occur; and

as noted, under a negligence standard, Burlington cannot beheld liable. See

supra, at 771.
The Court's decision is also in considerable tension with
our holding in Meritor that employers are not strictly liablefor a supervisor's sexual harassment. See

Meritor Savings
Bank, FSB v. Vinson, supra, at 72. Although the Courtrecognizes an affirmative defense--based solely on its divination of Title VII's gestalt, see ante, at 764--it provides shock-ingly little guidance about how employers can actually avoid
vicarious liability. Instead, it issues only Delphic pro-nouncements and leaves the dirty work to the lower courts:

"While proof that an employer had promulgated anantiharassment policy with complaint procedure is not
necessary in every instance as a matter of law, the needfor a stated policy suitable to the employment circumstances may appropriately be addressed in any case
when litigating the first element of the defense. And
while proof that an employee failed to fulfill the corresponding obligation of reasonable care to avoid harm is
not limited to showing an unreasonable failure to use
any complaint procedure provided by the employer, a
demonstration of such failure will normally suffice to
satisfy the employer's burden under the second element
of the defense." Ante, at 765.

What these statements mean for district courts ruling on
motions for summary judgment--the critical question for
employers now subject to the vicarious liability rule--
remains a mystery. Moreover, employers will be liable notwithstanding the affirmative defense, even though they acted
reasonably, so long as the plaintiff in question fulfilled her
duty of reasonable care to avoid harm. See ibid. In practice, therefore, employer liability very well may be the rule.

But as the Court acknowledges, this is the one result that itis clear Congress did not intend. See ante, at 763; Meritor

be more and more litigation to clarify applicable legal rulesin an area in which both practitioners and the courts have
long been begging for guidance. It thus truly boggles themind that the Court can claim that its holding will effect
"Congress' intention to promote conciliation rather than liti-gation in the Title VII context."

eight separate opinions in the Court of Appeals on a funda-mental question, and in which we granted certiorari "to assist in defining the relevant standards of employer liability."

Popular misconceptions notwithstanding, sexual harass-ment is not a freestanding federal tort, but a form of employment discrimination. As such, it should be treated no differ-ently (and certainly no better) than the other forms of
harassment that are illegal under Title VII. I would restoreparallel treatment of employer liability for racial and sexual
harassment and hold an employer liable for a hostile workenvironment only if the employer is truly at fault. I therefore respectfully dissent.

FARAGHER v. CITY OF BOCA RATON
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eleventh circuit

No. 97-282. Argued March 25, 1998--Decided June 26, 1998
After resigning as a lifeguard with respondent City of Boca Raton (City),

petitioner Beth Ann Faragher brought an action against the City and
her immediate supervisors, Bill Terry and David Silverman, for nominal
damages and other relief, alleging, among other things, that the supervisors had created a "sexually hostile atmosphere" at work by repeatedly
subjecting Faragher and other female lifeguards to "uninvited and offensive touching," by making lewd remarks, and by speaking of women in
offensive terms, and that this conduct constituted discrimination in the
"terms, conditions, and privileges" of her employment in violation of
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-2(a)(1).
Following a bench trial, the District Court concluded that the supervisors' conduct was discriminatory harassment sufficiently serious to alter
the conditions of Faragher's employment and constitute an abusive
working environment. The District Court then held that the City could
be held liable for the harassment of its supervisory employees because
the harassment was pervasive enough to support an inference that the
City had "knowledge, or constructive knowledge," of it; under traditional agency principles Terry and Silverman were acting as the City's
agents when they committed the harassing acts; and a third supervisor
had knowledge of the harassment and failed to report it to City officials.
The Eleventh Circuit, sitting en banc, reversed. Relying on Meritor
Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477 U. S. 57, and on the Restatement
(Second) of Agency $ 219 (1957) (Restatement), the Court of Appeals
held that Terry and Silverman were not acting within the scope of their
employment when they engaged in the harassing conduct, that their
agency relationship with the City did not facilitate the harassment, that
constructive knowledge of it could not be imputed to the City because
of its pervasiveness or the supervisor's knowledge, and that the City
could not be held liable for negligence in failing to prevent it.

Held: An employer is vicariously liable for actionable discrimination

caused by a supervisor, but subject to an affirmative defense looking to
the reasonableness of the employer's conduct as well as that of the plaintiff victim. Pp. 786-810.

(a) While the Court has delineated the substantive contours of the
hostile environment Title VII forbids, see, e. g., Harris v. Forklift Sys524US2 Unit: U100 [09-15-00 14:43:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Syllabus
tems, Inc., 510 U. S. 17, 21-22, its cases have established few definitive
rules for determining when an employer will be liable for a discriminatory environment that is otherwise actionably abusive. The Court's
only discussion to date of the standards of employer liability came in
Meritor, supra, where the Court held that traditional agency principles
were relevant for determining employer liability. Although the Court
cited the Restatement $$ 219-237 with general approval, the Court cautioned that common-law agency principles might not be transferable in
all their particulars. Pp. 786-792.

(b) Restatement $ 219(1) provides that "a master is subject to liability
for the torts of his servants committed while acting in the scope of their
employment." Although Title VII cases in the Courts of Appeals have
typically held, or assumed, that supervisory sexual harassment falls outside the scope of employment because it is motivated solely by individual
desires and serves no purpose of the employer, these cases appear to be
in tension with others defining the scope of the employment broadly to
hold employers vicariously liable for employees' intentional torts, including sexual assaults, that were not done to serve the employer, but were
deemed to be characteristic of its activities or a foreseeable consequence
of its business. This tension is the result of differing judgments about
the desirability of holding an employer liable for his subordinates' wayward behavior. The proper analysis here, then, calls not for a mechanical application of indefinite and malleable factors set forth in the Restatement, but rather an enquiry into whether it is proper to conclude
that sexual harassment is one of the normal risks of doing business
the employer should bear. An employer can reasonably anticipate the
possibility of sexual harassment occurring in the workplace, and this
might justify the assignment of the costs of this behavior to the employer rather than to the victim. Two things counsel in favor of the
contrary conclusion, however. First, there is no reason to suppose that
Congress wished courts to ignore the traditional distinction between
acts falling within the scope of employment and acts amounting to what
the older law called frolics or detours from the course of employment.
Second, the lower courts, by uniformly judging employer liability for
co-worker harassment under a negligence standard, have implicitly
treated such harassment outside the scope of employment. It is unlikely that such treatment would escape efforts to render them obsolete
if the Court held that harassing supervisors necessarily act within the
scope of their employment. The rationale for doing so would apply
when the behavior was that of coemployees, because the employer generally benefits from the work of common employees as from the work
of supervisors. The answer to this argument might be that the scope
of supervisory employment may be treated separately because super524US2 Unit: U100 [09-15-00 14:43:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Syllabus
visors have special authority enhancing their capacity to harass and
the employer can guard against their misbehavior more easily. This
answer, however, implicates an entirely separate category of agency
law, considered in the next section. Given the virtue of categorical
clarity, it is better to reject reliance on misuse of supervisory authority (without more) as irrelevant to the scope-of-employment analysis.
Pp. 793-801.

(c) The Court of Appeals erred in rejecting a theory of vicarious liability based on $ 219(2)(d) of the Restatement, which provides that an
employer "is not subject to liability for the torts of his servants acting
outside the scope of their employment unless . . . the servant purported
to act or speak on behalf of the principal and there was reliance on
apparent authority, or he was aided in accomplishing the tort by the
existence of the agency relation." It makes sense to hold an employer
vicariously liable under Title VII for some tortious conduct of a supervisor made possible by use of his supervisory authority, and the aided-byagency-relation principle of $ 219(2)(d) provides an appropriate starting
point for determining liability for the kind of harassment presented
here. In a sense a supervisor is always assisted in his misconduct by
the supervisory relationship; however, the imposition of liability based
on the misuse of supervisory authority must be squared with Meritor's
holding that an employer is not "automatically" liable for harassment by
a supervisor who creates the requisite degree of discrimination. There
are two basic alternatives to counter the risk of automatic liability. The
first is to require proof of some affirmative invocation of that authority
by the harassing supervisor; the second is to recognize an affirmative
defense to liability in some circumstances, even when a supervisor has
created the actionable environment. The problem with the first alternative is that there is not a clear line between the affirmative and
merely implicit uses of supervisory power; such a rule would often lead
to close judgment calls and results that appear disparate if not contradictory, and the temptation to litigate would be hard to resist. The
second alternative would avoid this particular temptation to litigate and
implement Title VII sensibly by giving employers an incentive to prevent and eliminate harassment and by requiring employees to take advantage of the preventive or remedial apparatus of their employers.
Thus, the Court adopts the following holding in this case and in Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth, ante, p. 742, also decided today. An
employer is subject to vicarious liability to a victimized employee for an
actionable hostile environment created by a supervisor with immediate
(or successively higher) authority over the employee. When no tangible employment action is taken, a defending employer may raise an affirmative defense to liability or damages, subject to proof by a prepon524US2 Unit: U100 [09-15-00 14:43:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN
778 FARAGHER v. BOCA RATON

Syllabus
derance of the evidence. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(c). The defense
comprises two necessary elements: (a) that the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing
behavior, and (b) that the plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take
advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the
employer or to avoid harm otherwise. While proof that an employer
had promulgated an antiharassment policy with complaint procedure is
not necessary in every instance as a matter of law, the need for a stated
policy suitable to the employment circumstances may appropriately be
addressed in any case when litigating the first element of the defense.
And while proof that an employee failed to fulfill the corresponding obligation of reasonable care to avoid harm is not limited to showing an
unreasonable failure to use any complaint procedure provided by the
employer, a demonstration of such failure will normally suffice to satisfy
the employer's burden under the second element of the defense. No
affirmative defense is available, however, when the supervisor's harassment culminates in a tangible employment action, such as discharge,
demotion, or undesirable reassignment. Pp. 801-808.

(d) Under this standard, the Eleventh Circuit's judgment must be reversed. The District Court found that the degree of hostility in the
work environment rose to the actionable level and was attributable to
Silverman and Terry, and it is clear that these supervisors were granted
virtually unchecked authority over their subordinates and that Faragher and her colleagues were completely isolated from the City's higher
management. While the City would have an opportunity to raise an
affirmative defense if there were any serious prospect of its presenting
one, it appears from the record that any such avenue is closed. The
District Court found that the City had entirely failed to disseminate its
sexual harassment policy among the beach employees and that its officials made no attempt to keep track of the conduct of supervisors, and
the record makes clear that the City's policy did not include any harassing supervisors assurance that could be bypassed in registering complaints. Under such circumstances, the Court holds as a matter of law
that the City could not be found to have exercised reasonable care to
prevent the supervisors' harassing conduct. Although the record discloses two possible grounds upon which the City might seek to excuse
its failure to distribute its policy and to establish a complaint mechanism, both are contradicted by the record. The City points to nothing
that might justify a conclusion by the District Court on remand that the
City had exercised reasonable care. Nor is there any reason to remand
for consideration of Faragher's efforts to mitigate her own damages,
since the award to her was solely nominal. Pp. 808-809.

(e) There is no occasion to consider whether the supervisors' knowledge of the harassment could be imputed to the City. Liability on that
theory could not be determined without further factfinding on remand,
whereas the reversal necessary on the supervisory harassment theory

Opinion of the Court
Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case calls for identification of the circumstances underwhich an employer may be held liable under Title VII of the

Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 253, as amended, 42 U. S. C.$ 2000e

et seq., for the acts of a supervisory employee whosesexual harassment of subordinates has created a hostile work

environment amounting to employment discrimination. Wehold that an employer is vicariously liable for actionable discrimination caused by a supervisor, but subject to an affirm-ative defense looking to the reasonableness of the employer's
conduct as well as that of a plaintiff victim.

Between 1985 and 1990, while attending college, petitionerBeth Ann Faragher worked part time and during the summers as an ocean lifeguard for the Marine Safety Section ofthe Parks and Recreation Department of respondent, the
City of Boca Raton, Florida (City). During this period,Faragher's immediate supervisors were Bill Terry, David
Silverman, and Robert Gordon. In June 1990, Faragherresigned.

In 1992, Faragher brought an action against Terry, Silver-man, and the City, asserting claims under Title VII, Rev.
Stat. $ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, and Florida law. So far as itconcerns the Title VII claim, the complaint alleged that
Terry and Silverman created a "sexually hostile atmosphere"at the beach by repeatedly subjecting Faragher and other
female lifeguards to "uninvited and offensive touching," bymaking lewd remarks, and by speaking of women in offensive
terms. The complaint contained specific allegations thatTerry once said that he would never promote a woman to the
rank of lieutenant, and that Silverman had said to Faragher,"Date me or clean the toilets for a year." Asserting that

Terry and Silverman were agents of the City, and that theirconduct amounted to discrimination in the "terms, conditions, and privileges" of her employment, 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-2(a)(1), Faragher sought a judgment against the City for
nominal damages, costs, and attorney's fees.

Following a bench trial, the United States District Courtfor the Southern District of Florida found that throughout

Faragher's employment with the City, Terry served as Chiefof the Marine Safety Division, with authority to hire new
lifeguards (subject to the approval of higher management),to supervise all aspects of the lifeguards' work assignments,
to engage in counseling, to deliver oral reprimands, and to
make a record of any such discipline. 864 F. Supp. 1552,
1563-1564 (1994). Silverman was a Marine Safety lieutenant from 1985 until June 1989, when he became a captain.
Id., at 1555. Gordon began the employment period as a lieutenant and at some point was promoted to the position of
training captain. In these positions, Silverman and Gordon
were responsible for making the lifeguards' daily assignments, and for supervising their work and fitness training.
Id., at 1564.

The lifeguards and supervisors were stationed at the city
beach and worked out of the Marine Safety Headquarters, a
small one-story building containing an office, a meeting room,
and a single, unisex locker room with a shower. Id., at 1556.
Their work routine was structured in a "paramilitary configuration," id., at 1564, with a clear chain of command.
Lifeguards reported to lieutenants and captains, who reported to Terry. He was supervised by the Recreation
Superintendent, who in turn reported to a Director of Parks
and Recreation, answerable to the City Manager. Id., at
1555. The lifeguards had no significant contact with higher
city officials like the Recreation Superintendent. Id., at
1564.

In February 1986, the City adopted a sexual harassment
policy, which it stated in a memorandum from the City Man524US2 Unit: U100 [09-15-00 14:43:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
ager addressed to all employees. Id., at 1560. In May1990, the City revised the policy and reissued a statement of

it. Ibid. Although the City may actually have circulatedthe memos and statements to some employees, it completely
failed to disseminate its policy among employees of the Marine Safety Section, with the result that Terry, Silverman,Gordon, and many lifeguards were unaware of it.

Ibid.
From time to time over the course of Faragher's tenure atthe Marine Safety Section, between 4 and 6 of the 40 to 50

lifeguards were women. Id., at 1556. During that 5-yearperiod, Terry repeatedly touched the bodies of female employees without invitation, ibid., would put his arm around
Faragher, with his hand on her buttocks, id., at 1557, and
once made contact with another female lifeguard in a motion
of sexual simulation, id., at 1556. He made crudely demeaning references to women generally, id., at 1557, and once
commented disparagingly on Faragher's shape, ibid. During a job interview with a woman he hired as a lifeguard,
Terry said that the female lifeguards had sex with their male
counterparts and asked whether she would do the same.
Ibid.

Silverman behaved in similar ways. He once tackled Faragher and remarked that, but for a physical characteristic he
found unattractive, he would readily have had sexual relations with her. Ibid. Another time, he pantomimed an act
of oral sex. Ibid. Within earshot of the female lifeguards,
Silverman made frequent, vulgar references to women and
sexual matters, commented on the bodies of female lifeguards and beachgoers, and at least twice told female lifeguards that he would like to engage in sex with them. Id.,
at 1557-1558.

Faragher did not complain to higher management about
Terry or Silverman. Although she spoke of their behavior
to Gordon, she did not regard these discussions as formal
complaints to a supervisor but as conversations with a person she held in high esteem. Id., at 1559. Other female

Opinion of the Court
lifeguards had similarly informal talks with Gordon, but be-cause Gordon did not feel that it was his place to do so, he

did not report these complaints to Terry, his own supervisor,or to any other city official.

Id., at 1559-1560. Gordon responded to the complaints of one lifeguard by saying that
"the City just [doesn't] care." Id., at 1561.In April 1990, however, two months before Faragher's resignation, Nancy Ewanchew, a former lifeguard, wrote toRichard Bender, the City's Personnel Director, complaining
that Terry and Silverman had harassed her and other femalelifeguards.

Id., at 1559. Following investigation of this
complaint, the City found that Terry and Silverman had behaved improperly, reprimanded them, and required them to
choose between a suspension without pay or the forfeiture
of annual leave. Ibid.

On the basis of these findings, the District Court concluded
that the conduct of Terry and Silverman was discriminatory
harassment sufficiently serious to alter the conditions of
Faragher's employment and constitute an abusive working
environment. Id., at 1562-1563. The District Court then
ruled that there were three justifications for holding the City
liable for the harassment of its supervisory employees.
First, the court noted that the harassment was pervasive
enough to support an inference that the City had "knowledge, or constructive knowledge," of it. Id., at 1563. Next,
it ruled that the City was liable under traditional agency
principles because Terry and Silverman were acting as
its agents when they committed the harassing acts. Id.,
at 1563-1564. Finally, the court observed that Gordon's
knowledge of the harassment, combined with his inaction,
"provides a further basis for imputing liability on [sic] the
City." Id., at 1564. The District Court then awarded Faragher $1 in nominal damages on her Title VII claim. Id.,
at 1564-1565.

A panel of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit
reversed the judgment against the City. 76 F. 3d 1155

524US2 Unit: U100 [09-15-00 14:43:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN
784 FARAGHER v. BOCA RATON

Opinion of the Court
(1996). Although the panel had "no trouble concluding thatTerry's and Silverman's conduct . . . was severe and pervasive enough to create an objectively abusive work environ-ment,"

id., at 1162, it overturned the District Court's conclusion that the City was liable. The panel ruled that Terry
and Silverman were not acting within the scope of their em-ployment when they engaged in the harassment,

id., at 1166,
that they were not aided in their actions by the agency rela-tionship,

id., at 1166, n. 14, and that the City had no constructive knowledge of the harassment by virtue of its pervasive-ness or Gordon's actual knowledge,

id., at 1167, and n. 16.
In a 7-to-5 decision, the full Court of Appeals, sitting en
banc, adopted the panel's conclusion. 111 F. 3d 1530 (1997).
Relying on our decision in Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v.
Vinson, 477 U. S. 57 (1986), and on the Restatement (Second)
of Agency $ 219 (1957) (hereinafter Restatement), the court
held that "an employer may be indirectly liable for hostile
environment sexual harassment by a superior: (1) if the harassment occurs within the scope of the superior's employment; (2) if the employer assigns performance of a nondelegable duty to a supervisor and an employee is injured
because of the supervisor's failure to carry out that duty; or
(3) if there is an agency relationship which aids the supervisor's ability or opportunity to harass his subordinate." 111
F. 3d, at 1534-1535.

Applying these principles, the court rejected Faragher's
Title VII claim against the City. First, invoking standard
agency language to classify the harassment by each supervisor as a "frolic" unrelated to his authorized tasks, the court
found that in harassing Faragher, Terry and Silverman were
acting outside of the scope of their employment and solely to
further their own personal ends. Id., at 1536-1537. Next,
the court determined that the supervisors' agency relationship with the City did not assist them in perpetrating their
harassment. Id., at 1537. Though noting that "a supervisor is always aided in accomplishing hostile environment sex524US2 Unit: U100 [09-15-00 14:43:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN

785Cite as: 524 U. S. 775 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
ual harassment by the existence of the agency relationshipwith his employer because his responsibilities include close

proximity to and regular contact with the victim," the courtheld that traditional agency law does not employ so broad a
concept of aid as a predicate of employer liability, but requires something more than a mere combination of agencyrelationship and improper conduct by the agent.

Ibid. Because neither Terry nor Silverman threatened to fire ordemote Faragher, the court concluded that their agency

relationship did not facilitate their harassment. Ibid.The en banc court also affirmed the panel's ruling that the
City lacked constructive knowledge of the supervisors' harassment. The court read the District Court's opinion to rest
on an erroneous legal conclusion that any harassment pervasive enough to create a hostile environment must a fortiori
also suffice to charge the employer with constructive knowledge. Id., at 1538. Rejecting this approach, the court reviewed the record and found no adequate factual basis to
conclude that the harassment was so pervasive that the City
should have known of it, relying on the facts that the harassment occurred intermittently, over a long period of time, and
at a remote location. Ibid. In footnotes, the court also
rejected the arguments that the City should be deemed to
have known of the harassment through Gordon, id., at 1538,
n. 9, or charged with constructive knowledge because of its
failure to disseminate its sexual harassment policy among
the lifeguards, id., at 1539, n. 11.

Since our decision in Meritor, Courts of Appeals have
struggled to derive manageable standards to govern employer liability for hostile environment harassment perpetrated by supervisory employees. While following our admonition to find guidance in the common law of agency, as
embodied in the Restatement, the Courts of Appeals have
adopted different approaches. Compare, e. g., Harrison v.
Eddy Potash, Inc., 112 F. 3d 1437 (CA10 1997), vacated, post,
p. 947; 111 F. 3d 1530 (CA11 1997) (case below); Gary v.

A

Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, "[i]t shallbe an unlawful employment practice for an employer . . . to

fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or other-wise to discriminate against any individual with respect to
his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employ-ment, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex,
or national origin." 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-2(a)(1). We haverepeatedly made clear that although the statute mentions
specific employment decisions with immediate consequences,the scope of the prohibition " `is not limited to "economic" or
"tangible" discrimination,' " Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc.,510 U. S. 17, 21 (1993) (quoting

Meritor Savings Bank, FSBv. Vinson, supra, at 64), and that it covers more than

" `terms' and `conditions' in the narrow contractual sense."
Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc., 523 U. S. 75,78 (1998). Thus, in Meritor we held that sexual harassment

so "severe or pervasive" as to " `alter the conditions of [thevictim's] employment and create an abusive working environment' " violates Title VII. 477 U. S., at 67 (quoting Hensonv. Dundee, 682 F. 2d 897, 904 (CA11 1982)).

In thus holding that environmental claims are covered bythe statute, we drew upon earlier cases recognizing liability
for discriminatory harassment based on race and national or-igin, see,

e. g., Rogers v. EEOC, 454 F. 2d 234 (CA5 1971),cert. denied, 406 U. S. 957 (1972); Firefighters Institute for

Racial Equality v. St. Louis, 549 F. 2d 506 (CA8), cert. de-nied sub nom. Banta v. United States, 434 U. S. 819 (1977),

Opinion of the Court
just as we have also followed the lead of such cases in at-tempting to define the severity of the offensive conditions

necessary to constitute actionable sex discrimination underthe statute. See, e. g., Rogers, supra, at 238 ("[M]ere utterance of an ethnic or racial epithet which engenders offensivefeelings in an employee" would not sufficiently alter terms
and conditions of employment to violate Title VII).1 Seealso

Daniels v. Essex Group, Inc., 937 F. 2d 1264, 1271-1272(CA7 1991); Davis v. Monsanto Chemical Co., 858 F. 2d 345,

349 (CA6 1988), cert. denied, 490 U. S. 1110 (1989); Snell v.Suffolk County, 782 F. 2d 1094, 1103 (CA2 1986); 1 B. Lindemann & P. Grossman, Employment Discrimination Law 349,and nn. 36-37 (3d ed. 1996) (hereinafter Lindemann & Grossman) (citing cases instructing that "[d]iscourtesy or rudenessshould not be confused with racial harassment" and that "a
lack of racial sensitivity does not, alone, amount to action-able harassment").

So, in Harris, we explained that in order to be actionableunder the statute, a sexually objectionable environment
must be both objectively and subjectively offensive, one thata reasonable person would find hostile or abusive, and one
that the victim in fact did perceive to be so. 510 U. S., at21-22. We directed courts to determine whether an environment is sufficiently hostile or abusive by "looking at allthe circumstances," including the "frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threat1 Similarly, Courts of Appeals in sexual harassment cases have properly
drawn on standards developed in cases involving racial harassment. See,
e. g., Carrero v. New York City Housing Auth., 890 F. 2d 569, 577 (CA2
1989) (citing Lopez v. S. B. Thomas, Inc., 831 F. 2d 1184, 1189 (CA2 1987),
a case of racial harassment, for the proposition that incidents of environmental sexual harassment "must be more than episodic; they must be sufficiently continuous and concerted in order to be deemed pervasive"). Although racial and sexual harassment will often take different forms, and
standards may not be entirely interchangeable, we think there is good
sense in seeking generally to harmonize the standards of what amounts to
actionable harassment.

Opinion of the Court
ening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; andwhether it unreasonably interferes with an employee's work

performance." Id., at 23. Most recently, we explained thatTitle VII does not prohibit "genuine but innocuous differences in the ways men and women routinely interact with
members of the same sex and of the opposite sex." Oncale,523 U. S., at 81. A recurring point in these opinions is that

"simple teasing," id., at 82, offhand comments, and iso-lated incidents (unless extremely serious) will not amount
to discriminatory changes in the "terms and conditions ofemployment."

These standards for judging hostility are sufficiently demanding to ensure that Title VII does not become a "general
civility code." Id., at 80. Properly applied, they will filter
out complaints attacking "the ordinary tribulations of the
workplace, such as the sporadic use of abusive language,
gender-related jokes, and occasional teasing." B. Lindemann & D. Kadue, Sexual Harassment in Employment Law
175 (1992) (hereinafter Lindemann & Kadue) (footnotes omitted). We have made it clear that conduct must be extreme
to amount to a change in the terms and conditions of employment, and the Courts of Appeals have heeded this view.
See, e. g., Carrero v. New York City Housing Auth., 890 F. 2d
569, 577-578 (CA2 1989); Moylan v. Maries County, 792
F. 2d 746, 749-750 (CA8 1986); See also 1 Lindemann &
Grossman 805-807, n. 290 (collecting cases granting summary
judgment for employers because the alleged harassment was
not actionably severe or pervasive).

While indicating the substantive contours of the hostile
environments forbidden by Title VII, our cases have established few definite rules for determining when an employer
will be liable for a discriminatory environment that is otherwise actionably abusive. Given the circumstances of many
of the litigated cases, including some that have come to us,
it is not surprising that in many of them, the issue has been
joined over the sufficiency of the abusive conditions, not the

Opinion of the Court
standards for determining an employer's liability for them.There have, for example, been myriad cases in which District

Courts and Courts of Appeals have held employers liable onaccount of actual knowledge by the employer, or highechelon officials of an employer organization, of sufficiently
harassing action by subordinates, which the employer or itsinformed officers have done nothing to stop. See,

e. g., Katz
v. Dole, 709 F. 2d 251, 256 (CA4 1983) (upholding employerliability because the "employer's supervisory personnel manifested unmistakable acquiescence in or approval of the har-assment");

EEOC v. Hacienda Hotel, 881 F. 2d 1504, 1516
(CA9 1989) (employer liable where hotel manager did not respond to complaints about supervisors' harassment); Hall v.
Gus Constr. Co., 842 F. 2d 1010, 1016 (CA8 1988) (holding
employer liable for harassment by co-workers because supervisor knew of the harassment but did nothing). In such instances, the combined knowledge and inaction may be seen
as demonstrable negligence, or as the employer's adoption of
the offending conduct and its results, quite as if they had
been authorized affirmatively as the employer's policy. Cf.
Oncale, supra, at 77 (victim reported his grounds for fearing
rape to company's safety supervisor, who turned him away
with no action on complaint).

Nor was it exceptional that standards for binding the
employer were not in issue in Harris, supra. In that case
of discrimination by hostile environment, the individual
charged with creating the abusive atmosphere was the president of the corporate employer, 510 U. S., at 19, who was
indisputably within that class of an employer organization's
officials who may be treated as the organization's proxy.
Burns v. McGregor Electronic Industries, Inc., 955 F. 2d
559, 564 (CA8 1992) (employer-company liable where harassment was perpetrated by its owner); see Torres v. Pisano,
116 F. 3d 625, 634-635, and n. 11 (CA2) (noting that a supervisor may hold a sufficiently high position "in the management hierarchy of the company for his actions to be imputed

automatically to the employer"), cert. denied, 522 U. S. 997(1997); cf.

Katz, supra, at 255 ("Except in situations where a
proprietor, partner or corporate officer participates person-ally in the harassing behavior," an employee must "demonstrat[e] the propriety of holding the employer liable").

Finally, there is nothing remarkable in the fact that claimsagainst employers for discriminatory employment actions

with tangible results, like hiring, firing, promotion, compen-sation, and work assignment, have resulted in employer liability once the discrimination was shown. See Meritor, 477U. S., at 70-71 (noting that "courts have consistently held
employers liable for the discriminatory discharges of employees by supervisory personnel, whether or not the employer
knew, should have known, or approved of the supervisor's
actions"); id., at 75 (Marshall, J., concurring in judgment)
("[W]hen a supervisor discriminatorily fires or refuses to
promote a black employee, that act is, without more, considered the act of the employer"); see also Anderson v. Methodist Evangelical Hospital, Inc., 464 F. 2d 723, 725 (CA6 1972)
(imposing liability on employer for racially motivated discharge by low-level supervisor, although the "record clearly
shows that [its] record in race relations . . . is exemplary").

A variety of reasons have been invoked for this apparently
unanimous rule. Some courts explain, in a variation of the
"proxy" theory discussed above, that when a supervisor
makes such decisions, he "merges" with the employer, and
his act becomes that of the employer. See, e. g., Kotcher v.
Rosa and Sullivan Appliance Ctr., Inc., 957 F. 2d 59, 62
(CA2 1992) ("The supervisor is deemed to act on behalf of
the employer when making decisions that affect the economic
status of the employee. From the perspective of the employee, the supervisor and the employer merge into a single
entity"); Steele v. Offshore Shipbuilding, Inc., 867 F. 2d 1311,
1316 (CA11 1989) ("When a supervisor requires sexual
favors as a quid pro quo for job benefits, the supervisor,
by definition, acts as the company"); see also Lindemann &

791Cite as: 524 U. S. 775 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
Grossman 776 (noting that courts hold employers "automati-cally liable" in

quid pro quo cases because the "supervisor's
actions, in conferring or withholding employment benefits,are deemed as a matter of law to be those of the employer").

Other courts have suggested that vicarious liability is proper
because the supervisor acts within the scope of his authoritywhen he makes discriminatory decisions in hiring, firing, promotion, and the like. See, e. g., Shager v. Upjohn Co., 913F. 2d 398, 405 (CA7 1990) ("[A] supervisory employee who
fires a subordinate is doing the kind of thing that he is au-thorized to do, and the wrongful intent with which he does
it does not carry his behavior so far beyond the orbit of his
responsibilities as to excuse the employer" (citing Restatement $ 228)). Others have suggested that vicarious liability
is appropriate because the supervisor who discriminates in
this manner is aided by the agency relation. See, e. g., Nichols v. Frank, 42 F. 3d 503, 514 (CA9 1994). Finally, still
other courts have endorsed both of the latter two theories.
See, e. g., Harrison, 112 F. 3d, at 1443; Henson, 682 F. 2d,
at 910.

The soundness of the results in these cases (and their continuing vitality), in light of basic agency principles, was confirmed by this Court's only discussion to date of standards of
employer liability, in Meritor, supra, which involved a claim
of discrimination by a supervisor's sexual harassment of a
subordinate over an extended period. In affirming the
Court of Appeals's holding that a hostile atmosphere resulting from sex discrimination is actionable under Title VII, we
also anticipated proceedings on remand by holding agency
principles relevant in assigning employer liability and by rejecting three per se rules of liability or immunity. 477 U. S.,
at 70-72. We observed that the very definition of employer
in Title VII, as including an "agent," id., at 72, expressed
Congress's intent that courts look to traditional principles of
the law of agency in devising standards of employer liability
in those instances where liability for the actions of a super524US2 Unit: U100 [09-15-00 14:43:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN
792 FARAGHER v. BOCA RATON

Opinion of the Court
visory employee was not otherwise obvious, ibid., and although we cautioned that "common-law principles may not
be transferable in all their particulars to Title VII," we cited
the Restatement $$ 219-237 with general approval. Ibid.

We then proceeded to reject two limitations on employer
liability, while establishing the rule that some limitation was
intended. We held that neither the existence of a company
grievance procedure nor the absence of actual notice of the
harassment on the part of upper management would be dispositive of such a claim; while either might be relevant to
the liability, neither would result automatically in employer
immunity. Ibid. Conversely, we held that Title VII placed
some limit on employer responsibility for the creation of a
discriminatory environment by a supervisor, and we held
that Title VII does not make employers "always automatically liable for sexual harassment by their supervisors,"
ibid., contrary to the view of the Court of Appeals, which
had held that "an employer is strictly liable for a hostile environment created by a supervisor's sexual advances, even
though the employer neither knew nor reasonably could have
known of the alleged misconduct," id., at 69-70.

Meritor's statement of the law is the foundation on which
we build today. Neither party before us has urged us to
depart from our customary adherence to stare decisis in statutory interpretation, Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491
U. S. 164, 172-173 (1989) (stare decisis has "special force" in
statutory interpretation). And the force of precedent here
is enhanced by Congress's amendment to the liability provisions of Title VII since the Meritor decision, without providing any modification of our holding. Civil Rights Act of
1991, $ 102, 105 Stat. 1072, 42 U. S. C. $ 1981a; see Keene
Corp. v. United States, 508 U. S. 200, 212 (1993) (applying
the "presumption that Congress was aware of [prior] judicial
interpretations and, in effect, adopted them"). See also

Opinion of the Court

B
The Court of Appeals identified, and rejected, three possible grounds drawn from agency law for holding the City
vicariously liable for the hostile environment created by
the supervisors. It considered whether the two supervisors
were acting within the scope of their employment when they
engaged in the harassing conduct. The court then enquired
whether they were significantly aided by the agency relationship in committing the harassment, and also considered
the possibility of imputing Gordon's knowledge of the harassment to the City. Finally, the Court of Appeals ruled out
liability for negligence in failing to prevent the harassment.
Faragher relies principally on the latter three theories of
liability.

1

A "master is subject to liability for the torts of his servants committed while acting in the scope of their employment." Restatement $ 219(1). This doctrine has traditionally defined the "scope of employment" as including conduct
"of the kind [a servant] is employed to perform," occurring
"substantially within the authorized time and space limits,"
and "actuated, at least in part, by a purpose to serve the
master," but as excluding an intentional use of force "unexpectable by the master." Id., $ 228(1).

Courts of Appeals have typically held, or assumed, that
conduct similar to the subject of this complaint falls outside
the scope of employment. See, e. g., Harrison, 112 F. 3d,
at 1444 (sexual harassment " `simply is not within the job
description of any supervisor or any other worker in any
reputable business' "); 111 F. 3d, at 1535-1536 (case below);

employment); Kauffman v. Allied Signal, Inc., 970 F. 2d
178, 184 (CA6) (holding that a supervisor's harassment was
within the scope of his employment, but nevertheless requiring the victim to show that the employer failed to respond
adequately when it learned of the harassment), cert. denied,
506 U. S. 1041 (1992). In so doing, the courts have emphasized that harassment consisting of unwelcome remarks and
touching is motivated solely by individual desires and serves
no purpose of the employer. For this reason, courts have
likened hostile environment sexual harassment to the classic
"frolic and detour" for which an employer has no vicarious
liability.

These cases ostensibly stand in some tension with others
arising outside Title VII, where the scope of employment has
been defined broadly enough to hold employers vicariously
liable for intentional torts that were in no sense inspired by
any purpose to serve the employer. In Ira S. Bushey &
Sons, Inc. v. United States, 398 F. 2d 167 (1968), for example,

Opinion of the Court
the Second Circuit charged the Government with vicariousliability for the depredation of a drunken sailor returning to

his ship after a night's carouse, who inexplicably openedvalves that flooded a drydock, damaging both the drydock
and the ship. Judge Friendly acknowledged that the sailor's
conduct was not remotely motivated by a purpose to servehis employer, but relied on the "deeply rooted sentiment that

a business enterprise cannot justly disclaim responsibility foraccidents which may fairly be said to be characteristic of its
activities," and imposed vicarious liability on the ground thatthe sailor's conduct "was not so `unforeseeable' as to make it
unfair to charge the Government with responsibility." Id.,
at 171. Other examples of an expansive sense of scope of
employment are readily found, see, e. g., Leonbruno v. Champlain Silk Mills, 229 N. Y. 470, 128 N. E. 711 (1920) (opinion
of Cardozo, J.) (employer was liable under worker's compensation statute for eye injury sustained when employee threw
an apple at another; the accident arose "in the course of employment" because such horseplay should be expected); Carr
v. Wm. C. Crowell Co., 28 Cal. 2d 652, 171 P. 2d 5 (1946)
(employer liable for actions of carpenter who attacked a coemployee with a hammer). Courts, in fact, have treated
scope of employment generously enough to include sexual
assaults. See, e. g., Primeaux v. United States, 102 F. 3d
1458, 1462-1463 (CA8 1996) (federal police officer on limited
duty sexually assaulted stranded motorist); Mary M. v. Los
Angeles, 54 Cal. 3d 202, 216-221, 814 P. 2d 1341, 1349-1352
(1991) (en banc) (police officer raped motorist after placing
her under arrest); Doe v. Samaritan Counseling Ctr., 791

sexual battery during sham physical examinations); Lyon v.

assistant raped patient).2 The rationales for these decisionshave varied, with some courts echoing Bushey in explaining

that the employee's acts were foreseeable and that the em-ployer should in fairness bear the resulting costs of doing
business, see, e. g., Mary M., supra, at 218, 814 P. 2d, at 1350,and others finding that the employee's sexual misconduct
arose from or was in some way related to the employee'sessential duties. See,

e. g., Samuels, supra, at 574 (tortiousconduct was "reasonably incidental" to the performance of

the nursing assistant's duties in caring for a "helpless" pa-tient in a "locked environment").

An assignment to reconcile the run of the Title VII caseswith those just cited would be a taxing one. Here it is
enough to recognize that their disparate results do not neces-sarily reflect wildly varying terms of the particular employment contracts involved, but represent differing judgmentsabout the desirability of holding an employer liable for his
subordinates' wayward behavior. In the instances in whichthere is a genuine question about the employer's responsibility for harmful conduct he did not in fact authorize, a holdingthat the conduct falls within the scope of employment ultimately expresses a conclusion not of fact but of law. Asone eminent authority has observed, the "highly indefinite
phrase" is "devoid of meaning in itself " and is "obviouslyno more than a bare formula to cover the unordered and
unauthorized acts of the servant for which it is found to beexpedient to charge the master with liability, as well as to
exclude other acts for which it is not." W. Keeton, D.Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keaton on Law
of Torts 502 (5th ed. 1984); see also Seavey, Speculations asto "Respondeat Superior," in Studies in Agency 129, 155

2 It bears noting that many courts in non-Title VII cases have held sexual assaults to fall outside the scope of employment. See Note, "Scope of
Employment" Redefined: Holding Employers Vicariously Liable for Sexual
Assaults Committed by their Employees, 76 Minn. L. Rev. 1513, 1521-1522,
and nn. 33, 34 (1992) (collecting cases).

Opinion of the Court
(1949) ("The liability of a master to a third person for thetorts of a servant has been widely extended by aid of the

elastic phrase `scope of the employment' which may be usedto include all which the court wishes to put into it"). Older
cases, for example, treated smoking by an employee during
working hours as an act outside the scope of employment,but more recently courts have generally held smoking on the

job to fall within the scope. Prosser & Keeton, supra, at504, and n. 23. It is not that employers formerly did not
authorize smoking but have now begun to do so, or that em-ployees previously smoked for their own purposes but now
do so to serve the employer. We simply understand smoking differently now and have revised the old judgments
about what ought to be done about it.

The proper analysis here, then, calls not for a mechanical
application of indefinite and malleable factors set forth in the
Restatement, see, e. g., $$ 219, 228, 229, but rather an enquiry
into the reasons that would support a conclusion that harassing behavior ought to be held within the scope of a supervisor's employment, and the reasons for the opposite view.
The Restatement itself points to such an approach, as in the
commentary that the "ultimate question" in determining the
scope of employment is "whether or not it is just that the
loss resulting from the servant's acts should be considered
as one of the normal risks to be borne by the business in
which the servant is employed." Id., $ 229, Comment a.
See generally Taber v. Maine, 67 F. 3d 1029, 1037 (CA2 1995)
("As the leading Torts treatise has put it, `the integrating
principle' of respondeat superior is `that the employer should
be liable for those faults that may be fairly regarded as risks
of his business, whether they are committed in furthering it
or not' " (quoting 5 F. Harper, F. James, & O. Gray, Law of
Torts $ 26.8, pp. 40-41 (2d ed. 1986))).

In the case before us, a justification for holding the offensive behavior within the scope of Terry's and Silverman's
employment was well put in Judge Barkett's dissent: "[A]

Opinion of the Court
pervasively hostile work environment of sexual harassmentis never (one would hope) authorized, but the supervisor is

clearly charged with maintaining a productive, safe work en-vironment. The supervisor directs and controls the conduct
of the employees, and the manner of doing so may inure to
the employer's benefit or detriment, including subjecting theemployer to Title VII liability." 111 F. 3d, at 1542 (opinion

dissenting in part and concurring in part). It is by now wellrecognized that hostile environment sexual harassment by
supervisors (and, for that matter, coemployees) is a persist-ent problem in the workplace. See Lindemann & Kadue 4-5
(discussing studies showing prevalence of sexual harassment); Ellerth, 123 F. 3d, at 511 (Posner, C. J., concurring
and dissenting) ("[E]veryone knows by now that sexual harassment is a common problem in the American workplace").
An employer can, in a general sense, reasonably anticipate
the possibility of such conduct occurring in its workplace,
and one might justify the assignment of the burden of the
untoward behavior to the employer as one of the costs of
doing business, to be charged to the enterprise rather than
the victim. As noted, supra, at 796-797, developments like
this occur from time to time in the law of agency.

Two things counsel us to draw the contrary conclusion.
First, there is no reason to suppose that Congress wished
courts to ignore the traditional distinction between acts falling within the scope and acts amounting to what the older
law called frolics or detours from the course of employment.
Such a distinction can readily be applied to the spectrum of
possible harassing conduct by supervisors, as the following
examples show. First, a supervisor might discriminate racially in job assignments in order to placate the prejudice
pervasive in the labor force. Instances of this variety of the
heckler's veto would be consciously intended to further the
employer's interests by preserving peace in the workplace.
Next, supervisors might reprimand male employees for
workplace failings with banter, but respond to women's

Opinion of the Court
shortcomings in harsh or vulgar terms. A third examplemight be the supervisor who, as here, expresses his sexual

interests in ways having no apparent object whatever ofserving an interest of the employer. If a line is to be drawn
between scope and frolic, it would lie between the first two
examples and the third, and it thus makes sense in terms oftraditional agency law to analyze the scope issue, in cases

like the third example, just as most federal courts addressingthat issue have done, classifying the harassment as beyond
the scope of employment.The second reason goes to an even broader unanimity of
views among the holdings of District Courts and Courts of
Appeals thus far. Those courts have held not only that the
sort of harassment at issue here was outside the scope of
supervisors' authority, but, by uniformly judging employer
liability for co-worker harassment under a negligence standard, they have also implicitly treated such harassment as
outside the scope of common employees' duties as well. See

propriate corrective action"); 3 L. Larson & A. Larson, Em-ployment Discrimination $ 46.07[4][a], p. 46-101 (2d ed. 1998)

(courts "uniformly" apply Equal Employment OpportunityCommission (EEOC) rule; "[i]t is not a controversial area").
If, indeed, the cases did not rest, at least implicitly, on the
notion that such harassment falls outside the scope of em-ployment, their liability issues would have turned simply on

the application of the scope-of-employment rule. Cf. Hunterv.

Allis-Chalmers, Inc., 797 F. 2d 1417, 1422 (CA7 1986) (noting that employer will not usually be liable under respondeat
superior for employee's racial harassment because it "would
be the rare case where racial harassment . . . could be
thought by the author of the harassment to help the employer's business").

It is quite unlikely that these cases would escape efforts
to render them obsolete if we were to hold that supervisors
who engage in discriminatory harassment are necessarily
acting within the scope of their employment. The rationale
for placing harassment within the scope of supervisory authority would be the fairness of requiring the employer to
bear the burden of foreseeable social behavior, and the same
rationale would apply when the behavior was that of coemployees. The employer generally benefits just as obviously from the work of common employees as from the work
of supervisors; they simply have different jobs to do, all
aimed at the success of the enterprise. As between an innocent employer and an innocent employee, if we use scope-ofemployment reasoning to require the employer to bear the
cost of an actionably hostile workplace created by one class
of employees (i. e., supervisors), it could appear just as appropriate to do the same when the environment was created
by another class (i. e., co-workers).

The answer to this argument might well be to point out
that the scope of supervisory employment may be treated
separately by recognizing that supervisors have special
authority enhancing their capacity to harass, and that the

524US2 Unit: U100 [09-15-00 14:43:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
employer can guard against their misbehavior more easilybecause their numbers are by definition fewer than the

numbers of regular employees. But this answer happens toimplicate an entirely separate category of agency law (to be
considered in the next section), which imposes vicariousliability on employers for tortious acts committed by use of
particular authority conferred as an element of an employee'sagency relationship with the employer. Since the virtue of
categorical clarity is obvious, it is better to reject relianceon misuse of supervisory authority (without more) as irrelevant to scope-of-employment analysis.

2
The Court of Appeals also rejected vicarious liability onthe part of the City insofar as it might rest on the concluding

principle set forth in $ 219(2)(d) of the Restatement, that anemployer "is not subject to liability for the torts of his servants acting outside the scope of their employment unless . . .the servant purported to act or speak on behalf of the principal and there was reliance on apparent authority, or he wasaided in accomplishing the tort by the existence of the
agency relation." Faragher points to several ways in whichthe agency relationship aided Terry and Silverman in carrying out their harassment. She argues that in general of-fending supervisors can abuse their authority to keep subordinates in their presence while they make offensivestatements, and that they implicitly threaten to misuse their
supervisory powers to deter any resistance or complaint.Thus, she maintains that power conferred on Terry and Silverman by the City enabled them to act for so long withoutprovoking defiance or complaint.

The City, however, contends that $ 219(2)(d) has no applica-tion here. It argues that the second qualification of the subsection, referring to a servant "aided in accomplishing thetort by the existence of the agency relation," merely "refines" the one preceding it, which holds the employer vicari524US2 Unit: U100 [09-15-00 14:43:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
ously liable for its servant's abuse of apparent authority.Brief for Respondent 30-31, and n. 24. But this narrow

reading is untenable; it would render the second qualificationof $ 219(2)(d) almost entirely superfluous (and would seem to
ask us to shut our eyes to the potential effects of supervisoryauthority, even when not explicitly invoked). The illustrations accompanying this subsection make clear that it coversnot only cases involving the abuse of apparent authority, but
also cases in which tortious conduct is made possible orfacilitated by the existence of the actual agency relationship.
See Restatement $ 219, Comment e (noting employer liability
where "the servant may be able to cause harm because of
his position as agent, as where a telegraph operator sendsfalse messages purporting to come from third persons" and

where the manager who operates a store "for an undisclosedprincipal is enabled to cheat the customers because of his
position"); id., $ 247, Illustration 1 (noting a newspaper's lia-bility for a libelous editorial published by an editor acting
for his own purposes).We therefore agree with Faragher that in implementing
Title VII it makes sense to hold an employer vicariously liable for some tortious conduct of a supervisor made possibleby abuse of his supervisory authority, and that the aided-byagency-relation principle embodied in $ 219(2)(d) of the Re-statement provides an appropriate starting point for determining liability for the kind of harassment presented here.3Several courts, indeed, have noted what Faragher has argued, that there is a sense in which a harassing supervisor
is always assisted in his misconduct by the supervisory relationship. See, e. g., Rodgers v. Western-Southern Life Ins.

3 We say "starting point" because our obligation here is not to make a
pronouncement of agency law in general or to transplant $ 219(2)(d) into
Title VII. Rather, it is to adapt agency concepts to the practical objectives of Title VII. As we said in Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson,
477 U. S. 57, 72 (1986), "common-law principles may not be transferable in
all their particulars to Title VII."

also White v. Monsanto Co., 585 So. 2d 1205, 1209-1210 (La.

and n. 2 (1970) (same). The agency relationship affords contact with an employee subjected to a supervisor's sexual harassment, and the victim may well be reluctant to accept the
risks of blowing the whistle on a superior. When a person
with supervisory authority discriminates in the terms and
conditions of subordinates' employment, his actions necessarily draw upon his superior position over the people who
report to him, or those under them, whereas an employee
generally cannot check a supervisor's abusive conduct the
same way that she might deal with abuse from a co-worker.
When a fellow employee harasses, the victim can walk away
or tell the offender where to go, but it may be difficult to
offer such responses to a supervisor, whose "power to supervise--[which may be] to hire and fire, and to set work schedules and pay rates--does not disappear . . . when he chooses
to harass through insults and offensive gestures rather than
directly with threats of firing or promises of promotion."
Estrich, Sex at Work, 43 Stan. L. Rev. 813, 854 (1991). Recognition of employer liability when discriminatory misuse of
supervisory authority alters the terms and conditions of a
victim's employment is underscored by the fact that the employer has a greater opportunity to guard against misconduct by supervisors than by common workers; employers
have greater opportunity and incentive to screen them, train
them, and monitor their performance.

804 FARAGHER v. BOCA RATON

Opinion of the Court
In sum, there are good reasons for vicarious liability formisuse of supervisory authority. That rationale must, however, satisfy one more condition. We are not entitled to rec-ognize this theory under Title VII unless we can square it
with Meritor's holding that an employer is not "automati-cally" liable for harassment by a supervisor who creates the
requisite degree of discrimination,4 and there is obviouslysome tension between that holding and the position that a
supervisor's misconduct aided by supervisory authority sub-jects the employer to liability vicariously; if the "aid" may
be the unspoken suggestion of retaliation by misuse of super-visory authority, the risk of automatic liability is high. To
counter it, we think there are two basic alternatives, onebeing to require proof of some affirmative invocation of

that authority by the harassing supervisor, the other to rec-ognize an affirmative defense to liability in some circumstances, even when a supervisor has created the actionableenvironment.

There is certainly some authority for requiring active oraffirmative, as distinct from passive or implicit, misuse of
supervisory authority before liability may be imputed.That is the way some courts have viewed the familiar cases
holding the employer liable for discriminatory employment

4 We are bound to honor Meritor on this point not merely because of the
high value placed on stare decisis in statutory interpretation, supra, at
792, but for a further reason as well. With the amendments enacted by
the Civil Rights Act of 1991, Congress both expanded the monetary relief
available under Title VII to include compensatory and punitive damages,
see $ 102, 105 Stat. 1072, 42 U. S. C. $ 1981a, and modified the statutory
grounds of several of our decisions, see $ 101 et seq. The decision of Congress to leave Meritor intact is conspicuous. We thus have to assume
that in expanding employers' potential liability under Title VII, Congress
relied on our statements in Meritor about the limits of employer liability.
To disregard those statements now (even if we were convinced of reasons
for doing so) would be not only to disregard stare decisis in statutory
interpretation, but to substitute our revised judgment about the proper
allocation of the costs of harassment for Congress's considered decision on
the subject.

Opinion of the Court
action with tangible consequences, like firing and demotion.See

supra, at 790. And we have already noted some examples of liability provided by the Restatement itself, whichsuggest that an affirmative misuse of power might be required. See supra, at 802 (telegraph operator sends false
messages, a store manager cheats customers, editor pub-lishes libelous editorial).

But neat examples illustrating the line between the af-firmative and merely implicit uses of power are not easy to
come by in considering management behavior. Supervisorsdo not make speeches threatening sanctions whenever they
make requests in the legitimate exercise of managerial authority, and yet every subordinate employee knows the sanctions exist; this is the reason that courts have consistently
held that acts of supervisors have greater power to alter the
environment than acts of coemployees generally, see supra,
at 802-803. How far from the course of ostensible supervisory behavior would a company officer have to step before
his orders would not reasonably be seen as actively using
authority? Judgment calls would often be close, the results
would often seem disparate even if not demonstrably contradictory, and the temptation to litigate would be hard to
resist. We think plaintiffs and defendants alike would be
poorly served by an active-use rule.

The other basic alternative to automatic liability would
avoid this particular temptation to litigate, but allow an employer to show as an affirmative defense to liability that the
employer had exercised reasonable care to avoid harassment
and to eliminate it when it might occur, and that the complaining employee had failed to act with like reasonable care
to take advantage of the employer's safeguards and otherwise to prevent harm that could have been avoided. This
composite defense would, we think, implement the statute
sensibly, for reasons that are not hard to fathom.

ination," Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U. S. 405, 418(1975), its "primary objective," like that of any statute meant

to influence primary conduct, is not to provide redress butto avoid harm.

Id., at 417. As long ago as 1980, the EEOC,
charged with the enforcement of Title VII, 42 U. S. C.

$ 2000e-4, adopted regulations advising employers to "takeall steps necessary to prevent sexual harassment from occurring, such as . . . informing employees of their right toraise and how to raise the issue of harassment." 29 CFR

$ 1604.11(f ) (1997), and in 1990 the EEOC issued a policystatement enjoining employers to establish a complaint procedure "designed to encourage victims of harassment to
come forward [without requiring] a victim to complain first
to the offending supervisor." EEOC Policy Guidance on
Sexual Harassment, 8 FEP Manual 405:6699 (Mar. 19, 1990)
(internal quotation marks omitted). It would therefore implement clear statutory policy and complement the Government's Title VII enforcement efforts to recognize the employer's affirmative obligation to prevent violations and give
credit here to employers who make reasonable efforts to discharge their duty. Indeed, a theory of vicarious liability for
misuse of supervisory power would be at odds with the statutory policy if it failed to provide employers with some
such incentive.

The requirement to show that the employee has failed in a
coordinate duty to avoid or mitigate harm reflects an equally
obvious policy imported from the general theory of damages,
that a victim has a duty "to use such means as are reasonable
under the circumstances to avoid or minimize the damages"
that result from violations of the statute. Ford Motor Co.
v. EEOC, 458 U. S. 219, 231, n. 15 (1982) (quoting C. McCormick, Law of Damages 127 (1935) (internal quotation marks

proven, effective mechanism for reporting and resolving
complaints of sexual harassment, available to the employee
without undue risk or expense. If the plaintiff unreasonably

Opinion of the Court
failed to avail herself of the employer's preventive or reme-dial apparatus, she should not recover damages that could

have been avoided if she had done so. If the victim couldhave avoided harm, no liability should be found against the
employer who had taken reasonable care, and if damages
could reasonably have been mitigated no award against aliable employer should reward a plaintiff for what her own

efforts could have avoided.In order to accommodate the principle of vicarious liability
for harm caused by misuse of supervisory authority, as wellas Title VII's equally basic policies of encouraging forethought by employers and saving action by objecting employees, we adopt the following holding in this case and in
Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth, ante, p. 742, also decided today. An employer is subject to vicarious liability to
a victimized employee for an actionable hostile environment
created by a supervisor with immediate (or successively
higher) authority over the employee. When no tangible employment action is taken, a defending employer may raise an
affirmative defense to liability or damages, subject to proof
by a preponderance of the evidence, see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.
8(c). The defense comprises two necessary elements: (a)
that the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and
correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior, and (b)
that the plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise. While
proof that an employer had promulgated an antiharassment
policy with complaint procedure is not necessary in every
instance as a matter of law, the need for a stated policy suitable to the employment circumstances may appropriately be
addressed in any case when litigating the first element of the
defense. And while proof that an employee failed to fulfill
the corresponding obligation of reasonable care to avoid
harm is not limited to showing an unreasonable failure to
use any complaint procedure provided by the employer, a

Opinion of the Court
demonstration of such failure will normally suffice to satisfythe employer's burden under the second element of the defense. No affirmative defense is available, however, whenthe supervisor's harassment culminates in a tangible employment action, such as discharge, demotion, or undesirable reassignment. See Burlington, ante, at 762-763.Applying these rules here, we believe that the judgment of

the Court of Appeals must be reversed. The District Courtfound that the degree of hostility in the work environment
rose to the actionable level and was attributable to Silver-man and Terry. It is undisputed that these supervisors
"were granted virtually unchecked authority" over their subordinates, "directly controll[ing] and supervis[ing] all aspects
of [Faragher's] day-to-day activities." 111 F. 3d, at 1544
(Barkett, J., dissenting in part and concurring in part). It is
also clear that Faragher and her colleagues were "completely
isolated from the City's higher management." Ibid. The
City did not seek review of these findings.

While the City would have an opportunity to raise an affirmative defense if there were any serious prospect of its
presenting one, it appears from the record that any such avenue is closed. The District Court found that the City had
entirely failed to disseminate its policy against sexual harassment among the beach employees and that its officials made
no attempt to keep track of the conduct of supervisors like
Terry and Silverman. The record also makes clear that the
City's policy did not include any assurance that the harassing
supervisors could be bypassed in registering complaints.
App. 274. Under such circumstances, we hold as a matter
of law that the City could not be found to have exercised
reasonable care to prevent the supervisors' harassing conduct. Unlike the employer of a small work force, who might
expect that sufficient care to prevent tortious behavior could
be exercised informally, those responsible for city operations
could not reasonably have thought that precautions against
hostile environments in any one of many departments in far524US2 Unit: U100 [09-15-00 14:43:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN

809Cite as: 524 U. S. 775 (1998)
Opinion of the Court
flung locations could be effective without communicatingsome formal policy against harassment, with a sensible complaint procedure.We have drawn this conclusion without overlooking two
possible grounds upon which the City might argue for the
opportunity to litigate further. There is, first, the Court ofAppeals's indulgent gloss on the relevant evidence: "There

is some evidence that the City did not effectively disseminateamong Marine Safety employees its sexual harassment policy." 111 F. 3d, at 1539, n. 11. But, in contrast to the Courtof Appeals's characterization, the District Court made an
explicit finding of a "complete failure on the part of the City
to disseminate said policy among Marine Safety Section
employees." 864 F. Supp., at 1560. The evidence supports
the District Court's finding and there is no contrary claim
before us.

The second possible ground for pursuing a defense was
asserted by the City in its argument addressing the possibility of negligence liability in this case. It said that it should
not be held liable for failing to promulgate an antiharassment
policy, because there was no apparent duty to do so in the
1985-1990 period. The City purports to rest this argument
on the position of the EEOC during the period mentioned,
but it turns out that the record on this point is quite against
the City's position. Although the EEOC issued regulations
dealing with promulgating a statement of policy and providing a complaint mechanism in 1990, see supra, at 806, ever
since 1980 its regulations have called for steps to prevent
violations, such as informing employees of their rights and
the means to assert them, ibid. The City, after all, adopted
an antiharassment policy in 1986.

The City points to nothing that might justify a conclusion
by the District Court on remand that the City had exercised
reasonable care. Nor is there any reason to remand for consideration of Faragher's efforts to mitigate her own damages,
since the award to her was solely nominal.

Thomas, J., dissenting

3
The Court of Appeals also rejected the possibility that itcould hold the City liable for the reason that it knew of the

harassment vicariously through the knowledge of its supervi-sors. We have no occasion to consider whether this was
error, however. We are satisfied that liability on the groundof vicarious knowledge could not be determined without further factfinding on remand, whereas the reversal necessaryon the theory of supervisory harassment renders any remand
for consideration of imputed knowledge entirely unjustifiable(as would be any consideration of negligence as an alternative to a theory of vicarious liability here).

III
The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the EleventhCircuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for reinstatement of the judgment of the District Court.

It is so ordered.

Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Scalia joins,dissenting.

For the reasons given in my dissenting opinion in Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth, ante, p. 742, absent an ad-verse employment consequence, an employer cannot be held

vicariously liable if a supervisor creates a hostile work envi-ronment. Petitioner suffered no adverse employment consequence; thus the Court of Appeals was correct to hold thatthe city of Boca Raton (City) is not vicariously liable for the
conduct of Chief Terry and Lieutenant Silverman. Becausethe Court reverses this judgment, I dissent.

As for petitioner's negligence claim, the District Courtmade no finding as to the City's negligence, and the Court of
Appeals did not directly consider the issue. I would there-fore remand the case to the District Court for further proceedings on this question alone. I disagree with the Court's

811Cite as: 524 U. S. 775 (1998)
Thomas, J., dissenting
conclusion that merely because the City did not disseminateits sexual harassment policy, it should be liable as a matter

of law. See ante, at 808-809.1 The City should be allowedto show either that: (1) there was a reasonably available avenue through which petitioner could have complained to aCity official who supervised both Chief Terry and Lieutenant
Silverman, see Brief for United States and EEOC as Amici
Curiae in Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson, O. T. 1985,No. 84-1979, p. 26,

2 or (2) it would not have learned of the

harassment even if the policy had been distributed.3 Peti-tioner, as the plaintiff, would of course bear the burden of

proving the City's negligence.

1 The harassment alleged in this case occurred intermittently over a 5-
year period between 1985 and 1990; the District Court's factual findings
do not indicate when in 1990 it ceased. It was only in March 1990 that
the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) issued a "policy
statement" "enjoining" employers to establish complaint procedures for
sexual harassment. See ante, at 806. The 1980 Guideline on which the
Court relies--because the EEOC has no substantive rulemaking authority
under Title VII, the Court is inaccurate to refer to it as a "regulatio[n],"
see ante, at 809--was wholly precatory and as such cannot establish negligence per se. See 29 CFR $ 1604.11(f) (1997) ("An employer should take
all steps necessary to prevent sexual harassment from occurring . . . ").

2 The City's Employment Handbook stated that employees with "complaints or grievances" could speak to the City's Personnel and Labor Relations Director about problems at work. See App. 280. The District
Court found that the City's Personnel Director, Richard Bender, moved
quickly to investigate the harassment charges against Terry and Silverman once they were brought to his attention. See App. to Pet. for Cert.
80a.

3 Even after petitioner read the City's sexual harassment policy in 1990,

see App. 188, she did not file a charge with City officials. Instead, she
filed suit against the City in 1992.

OPINION OF INDIVIDUAL JUSTICE

IN CHAMBERS

RUBIN, SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY, et al. v.

UNITED STATES, acting through the

independent counsel

on application for stay
No. A-53 (98-93). Decided July 17, 1998
The Secretary of the Treasury's application to stay the Court of Appeals'

decision to enforce subpoenas pending a decision on certiorari is denied.
He has not demonstrated that the interim enforcement of subpoenas
requiring the President's protectors to testify before a federal grand
jury investigating the President will cause irreparable harm. Nor has
he shown a likelihood that this Court, assuming it granted certiorari
and heard the case, would reverse the Court of Appeals' judgment.

Chief Justice Rehnquist, Circuit Justice.
This case is before me as Circuit Justice on the application
for stay submitted by the Solicitor General, on behalf of the
Secretary of the Treasury Robert E. Rubin. Because several of my colleagues are out of the country, I have decided
to rule on the matter myself rather than refer it to the
Conference.

An applicant for stay first must show irreparable harm if
a stay is denied. In my view, the applicant has not demonstrated that denying a stay and enforcing the subpoenas
pending a decision on certiorari would cause irreparable
harm. The Secretary identifies two injuries that would result from denying a stay: any privileged information would
be lost forever and the important interests that the "protective function privilege" protects would be destroyed. I cannot say that any harm caused by the interim enforcement of
the subpoenas will be irreparable. If the Secretary's claim

1301

524us2IC1H 02-10-99 11:41:56 PAGES IC13BXPGT n
1302 RUBIN v. UNITED STATES

Opinion in Chambers
of privilege is eventually upheld, disclosure of past eventswill not affect the President's relationship with his protectors in the future. On balance, the equities do not favorgranting a stay.

An applicant for stay must also show that there is a likeli-hood that four Members of this Court will grant certiorari
to review the decision of the Court of Appeals on the merits.This case is obviously not a run-of-the-mine dispute, pitting
as it does the prosecution's need for testimony before a grandjury against claims involving the safety and protection of
the President of the United States. I shall assume, withoutdeciding, that four Members of this Court on that basis
would grant certiorari.But a stay applicant must also show that there is a likelihood that this Court, having granted certiorari and heardthe case, would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals. The applicant simply has not made that showing tomy satisfaction, and I believe my view would be shared by a
majority of my colleagues. The opinion of the Court of Ap-peals seems to me cogent and correct. The District Court
which considered the matter was also of that view, and noneof the nine judges of the Court of Appeals even requested a
vote on the applicant's suggestion for rehearing en banc.The application for stay is accordingly denied.

CONSTITUTIONAL LAW.

Noncapital sentencing proceedings--Retrial on prior conviction allegation.--Double Jeopardy Clause, which precludes retrial on a prior conviction allegation in capital sentencing proceedings, does not apply in noncapital sentencing proceedings. Monge v. California, p. 721.

II. Due Process.

1. Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 1992--Health care benefits funding.--Court of Appeals' decision, that Act's allocation of liability
for funding health care benefits for coal industry retirees and their dependents does not violate Due Process Clause as applied to a company
that left coal industry in 1965, is reversed. Eastern Enterprises v.
Apfel, p. 498.

2. Jury instructions--Lesser included offense.--Beck v. Alabama, 447
U. S. 625--which invalidated a state law prohibiting lesser included offense instructions in capital cases, when such offenses to charged crime
existed under state law--does not require state courts to instruct juries
on offenses that are not lesser included offenses of charged crime under
state law. Hopkins v. Reeves, p. 88.

III. Excessive Fines.

Failure to report currency transport--Full forfeiture of funds.--Where
respondent's sole offense was his failure to report to Government, as required by federal law, that he was leaving United States with more than
$10,000 in currency, forfeiture of entire $357,144 he failed to declare would
violate Excessive Fines Clause because it would be grossly disproportional
to gravity of his offense. United States v. Bajakajian, p. 321.

IV. Extradition Clause.

Habeas relief--State court's authority.--New Mexico Supreme Court
exceeded its authority under Extradition Clause and Extradition Act when
it affirmed a habeas grant releasing respondent from custody even though
New Mexico Governor had previously ordered him extradited to Ohio.
New Mexico ex rel. Ortiz v. Reed, p. 151.

V. Freedom of Expression.

National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities Act of 1965--
Selection criteria for National Endowment for the Arts grants.--Title 20
U. S. C. $ 954(d)(1)--which requires NEA to consider "general standards
of decency and respect for . . . diverse beliefs and values" in awarding
grants--is facially valid, as it neither inherently interferes with First
Amendment rights nor violates constitutional vagueness principles. National Endowment for Arts v. Finley, p. 569.

Domestic proceeding--Fear of foreign prosecution.--A witness in a domestic proceeding may not claim Fifth Amendment privilege against selfincrimination based on fear of prosecution by a foreign nation. United
States v. Balsys, p. 666.

VIII. Searches and Seizures.

Admissibility of evidence--Parole revocation hearing.--Exclusionary
rule, which generally prohibits introduction at a criminal trial of evidence
obtained in violation of a defendant's Fourth Amendment rights, does not
apply in parole revocation hearings. Pennsylvania Bd. of Probation and
Parole v. Scott, p. 357.

IX. Taking of Property.

1. Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 1992--Health care benefits funding.--Court of Appeals' decision, that Act's allocation of liability

$ 922(a)(1)(A)--which forbids dealing in firearms without a federal license--requires proof only that defendant knew that his conduct was unlawful, not that he also knew of licensing requirement. Bryan v. United
States, p. 184.
